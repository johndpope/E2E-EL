Apoptosis has been shown to be induced by serum deprivation or copper treatment. To understand the toxicity of nonylphenol diethoxylate, we investigated the effects of NP2 EO on apoptosis induced by serum deprivation and copper by using PC12 cell system. Nonylphenol diethoxylate itself showed no toxicity and recovered cell viability from apoptosis. In addition, nonylphenol diethoxylate decreased DNA fragmentation caused by apoptosis in PC12 cells. This phenomenon was confirmed after treating apoptotic PC12 cells with nonylphenol diethoxylate, whereas the cytochrome c release into the cytosol decreased as compared to that in apoptotic cells not treated with nonylphenol diethoxylate s. Furthermore, Bax contents in apoptotic cells were reduced after exposure to nonylphenol diethoxylate. Thus, nonylphenol diethoxylate has the opposite effect on apoptosis in PC12 cells compared to nonylphenol, which enhances apoptosis induced by serum deprivation. The difference in structure of the two compounds is hypothesized to be responsible for this phenomenon. These results indicated that nonylphenol diethoxylate has capability to affect cell differentiation and development and has potentially harmful effect on organisms because of its unexpected impact on apoptosis. \u00a9 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Recently, activating mutations of the EZH2 and ZFX oncogenes were identified in benign parathyroid adenoma by whole exome sequencing. The same mutations had been found in blood and ovary malignant tumours. On one hand, this result raised the hypothesis that these oncogenes may play a role in the onset of parathyroid tumour, but it would also suggest they may be involved in malignant, rather benign, parathyroid neoplasm. Our aim was to verify the occurrence of selected mutations of the EZH2 and ZFX genes in an Italian cohort of 23 sporadic parathyroid carcinomas, 12 atypical and 45 typical adenomas. DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded tissues, PCR amplified and directly sequenced. No mutations were detected in the coding sequence and boundaries of both genes in any of the samples. Two polymorphisms of the EZH2 gene were identified with different prevalence: the rs2072407 variant was present in the 30 % of the samples, in keeping with the overall frequency in larger populations, while the rs78589034 variant, located close to the 5' end of the exon 16, was detected in only one proband with familial isolated hyperparathyroidism; we investigated the possible outcome on the splicing process. EZH2 and ZFX genes do not seem to have an impact on the onset of most parathyroid tumours, both benign and malignant, though further studies on larger cohorts of different ethnicity are needed."}

The aim of this study was to assess in the published literature the frequency and drivers of patient - physician discordance in global assessment in RA. A systematic literature review of all articles published up to January 2015 in Medline or Embase, reporting discordance in RA, was conducted by 2 investigators. Discordance was defined based on the absolute difference of patient global (PGA) and physician global assessments (PhGA) on 0-10-cm scales. The frequency of discordance and its predictors were collected in each study. Frequencies of discordance were pooled by meta-analysis using random effect. In all, 12 studies were selected (i.e., 11,879 patients): weighted mean \u00b1 SD age was 55.1 \u00b1 13.9 years, weighted mean \u00b1 SD disease duration was 10.4 \u00b1 9.3 years, and 80.7% were women. The value of the difference | PGA - PhGA | defining discordance varied between \u22650.5 cm (n = 2 studies) to \u22653 cm (n = 5 studies); the weighted mean value was 2.7 cm. The pooled percentage of patients with discordance was 43% (95% confidence interval 36%-51%; range 25%-76%). PGA was usually higher than PhGA. The drivers of PGA were pain and functional incapacity, whereas drivers of PhGA were joint counts and acute-phase reactants. Discordance in global assessment was most frequently defined as a difference of 3 points or more; even with such a stringent definition, up to half the patients were found to be discordant. The long-term consequences of this discordance remain to be determined."}

We evaluate whether a single dose of oral dexamethasone plus 4 days of placebo is not inferior to 5 days of oral prednisone in treatment of adults with mild to moderate asthma exacerbations to prevent relapse defined as an unscheduled return visit for additional treatment for persistent or worsening asthma within 14 days. Adult emergency department patients (aged 18 to 55 years) were randomized to receive either a single dose of 12 mg of oral dexamethasone with 4 days of placebo or a 5- day course of oral prednisone 60 mg a day. Outcomes including relapse were assessed by a follow-up telephone interview at 2 weeks. One hundred seventy-three dexamethasone and 203 prednisone subjects completed the study regimen and telephone follow-up. The dexamethasone group by a small margin surpassed the preset 8% difference between groups for noninferiority in relapse rates within 14 days (12.1% versus 9.8%; difference 2.3%; 95% confidence interval -4.1% to 8.6%). Subjects in the 2 groups had similar rates of hospitalization for their relapse visit (dexamethasone 3.4% versus prednisone 2.9%; difference 0.5%; 95% confidence interval -4.1% to 3.1%). Adverse effect rates were generally the same in the 2 groups. A single dose of oral dexamethasone did not demonstrate noninferiority to prednisone for 5 days by a very small margin for treatment of adults with mild to moderate asthma exacerbations.

Our aim was to determine the ultrasonographical, clinical, and biochemical predictors of malignancy in these patients. A total of 427 patients with cytologically Bethesda Category III (AUS / FLUS) thyroid nodules were included in this retrospective study. We divided the nodules into two subgroups according to the histopathology as benign and malignant, and compared the preoperative ultrasonographical, clinical, and biochemical findings. In overall, 427 patients with 449 AUS / FLUS nodules who had undergone surgery, the rate of malignancy was 23.4 % (105/449). When evaluated separately, the rate of malignancy was 25.8 % in nodules with AUS (82/318) and 17.6 % in nodules with FLUS (23/131) (p = 0.061). The vast majority of malignant specimens in histopathology consisted of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) (n = 91, 86.7 %).

Denaturation of the cofactor - binding loops of Escherichia coli transketolase (TK) was previously linked to the loss of enzyme activity under conditions of high pH or urea. Incubation at temperatures just below the thermal melting transition, above which the protein aggregates, was also found to anneal the enzyme to give an increased specific activity. The potential role of cofactor - binding loop instability in this process remained unclear. In this work, the two cofactor - binding loops (residues 185-192 and 382-392) were progressively mutated towards the equivalent sequence from the thermostable Thermus thermophilus TK and variants assessed for their impact on both thermostability and activity. Cofactor-binding loop 2 variants had detrimental effects on specific activity at elevated temperatures, whereas the H192P mutation in cofactor-binding loop 1 resulted in a two-fold improved stability to inactivation at elevated temperatures, and increased the critical onset temperature for aggregation. The specific activity of H192P was 3-fold and 19-fold higher than that for wild-type at 60\u00b0C and 65\u00b0C respectively, and also remained 2.7-4 fold higher after re-cooling from pre-incubations at either 55\u00b0C or 60\u00b0C for 1h. Interestingly, H192P was also 2-times more active than wild-type TK at 25\u00b0C. Optimal activity was achieved at 60\u00b0C for H192P compared to 55\u00b0C for wild type. These results show that cofactor-binding loop 1, plays a pivotal role in partial denaturation and aggregation at elevated temperatures. Furthermore, a single rigidifying mutation within this loop can significantly improve the enzyme specific activity, as well as the stability to thermal denaturation and aggregation, to give an increased temperature optimum for activity."}

Ten second year nursing students were recruited to apply an indwelling needle line with and without Vein Display. Another ten participants were recruited from various faculty to serve as patients. The quality of the venipuncture procedure at various selected sites was evaluated according to a scale developed by the authors. Time, scores and patterns of puncture - site selection were compared with respect to three different methods: [1] attempt 1 (tourniquet only), [2] attempt 2 (Vein Display only) and [3] attempt 3 (both). To validate the effectiveness of Vein Display, 52 trials were conducted in total. We found that venipuncture site selection time was significantly improved with the Vein Display, particularly in the case of difficult to administer venipuncture sites. Overall, we found no significant difference with respect to venipuncture quality, as determined by our scale. These results suggest that equipment such as the Vein Display can contribute immensely to the improvement of practical skills, such as venipuncture, especially in the context of elderly patients."}

We test whether the protective effect of nephron sparing surgery relative to radical nephrectomy is universal or present in specific subgroups of patients. A collaborative database of 5 institutions was queried to evaluate 1,783 patients without chronic kidney disease diagnosed with a clinical T1 renal mass that was treated with nephron sparing surgery or radical nephrectomy. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was done to assess the impact of surgery type (nephron sparing surgery vs radical nephrectomy) on other cause mortality after adjustment for patient and cancer characteristics. Interaction terms were used to test the hypothesis that the impact of surgery type varies according to specific subcohorts of patients. Ten-year other cause mortality -free survival rates were 90% and 88% after nephron sparing surgery and radical nephrectomy, respectively. In the overall population radical nephrectomy was not associated with an increased risk of other cause mortality on multivariable analysis compared to nephron sparing surgery (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.6-1.38, p = 0.6). However, radical nephrectomy increased the risk of other cause mortality according to the increasing baseline Charlson comorbidity index (interaction test p = 0.0008). For example, in a patient with a Charlson comorbidity index of 4 the probability of 10-year other cause mortality -free survival was 86% after nephron sparing surgery and 60% after radical nephrectomy. Elective nephron sparing surgery does not improve other cause survival relative to radical nephrectomy consistently in all patients with kidney cancer. Patients who are more ill with relevant comorbidities are those who benefit the most from nephron sparing surgery in terms of other cause mortality."}

In the Swedish National March Cohort 13,409 men and women over the age of 55 who had not experienced cancer, cardiovascular disease or hip fracture, were followed through record-linkages from 1997 through 2010. NEAC was assessed by a validated food frequency questionnaire collected at baseline.

During a mean follow-up time of 12.4years, we identified 491 incident cases of first hip fracture. Subjects in the highest quartile of dietary NEAC had a 39% lower risk of incident hip fracture compared to those in the lowest quartile (HR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.44-0.85). The association was non-linear (p for non-linearity: 0.004) with a potential threshold between the first and the second quartile and no further risk reduction at higher levels of dietary NEAC. Due to a low smoking prevalence in our study population, we had limited power to detect effect modification between dietary NEAC and smoking on a multiplicative or additive scale.

The antibiotics of interest were the red-pigmented undecylprodigiosin and blue-pigmented actinorhodin. Pure cultures of S. coelicolor in a defined medium produced higher concentrations of actinorhodin compared to those of undecylprodigiosin. The latter however, is more important due to its immunosuppressive and antitumor properties. As a strategy to increase undecylprodigiosin production, we added separately, live cells and heat-killed cells of E. coli C600, and the cell-free supernatant of E. coli culture to S. coelicolor cultures in shake flasks. The interaction with live cells of E. coli altered the antibiotic production pattern and undecylprodigiosin production was enhanced by 3.5-fold compared to the pure cultures of S. coelicolor and actinorhodin decreased by 15-fold. The heat-killed cells of E. coli however, had no effect on antibiotic production. In all cases, growth and glucose consumption of S. coelicolor remained almost the same as those observed in the pure culture indicating that the changes in antibiotic production were not due to nutritional stress.

Lumbar intrathecal fentanyl was used to attenuate the central projection of \u03bc-opioid receptor - sensitive locomotor muscle afferents during a 5 km cycling time trial. The findings suggest that the central projection of group III/IV muscle afferent feedback constrains voluntary neural ' drive ' to working locomotor muscle and limits the exercise - induced intramuscular metabolic perturbation. Therefore, the CNS might regulate the degree of metabolic perturbation within locomotor muscle and thereby limit peripheral fatigue. It appears that the group III/IV muscle afferents are an important neural link in this regulatory mechanism, which probably serves to protect locomotor muscle from the potentially severe functional impairment as a consequence of severe intramuscular metabolic disturbance. To investigate the role of metabo - and mechanosensitive group III/IV muscle afferents in limiting the intramuscular metabolic perturbation during whole body endurance exercise, eight subjects performed 5 km cycling time trials under control conditions (CTRL) and with lumbar intrathecal fentanyl impairing lower limb muscle afferent feedback (FENT). Vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were obtained before and immediately after exercise. Motoneuronal output was estimated through vastus lateralis surface electromyography (EMG).

Previously, we observed that exposure to a high-fat diet (HFD) in utero caused a metabolic syndrome -like phenomenon through epigenetic modifications of the adiponectin and leptin genes that persisted for multiple generations. Recent etiological studies indicated that paternal BMI had effects on offspring BMI that were independent of but additive to maternal BMI effects. Thus, we examined whether paternal HFD - induced obesity affected the metabolic status of offspring through epigenetic changes in the adiponectin and leptin genes. Additionally, we investigated whether a normal diet during subsequent generations abolished the epigenetic changes associated with paternal HFD exposure before conception. We observed the effects of paternal HFD exposure before conception over multiple generations on offspring metabolic traits, including weight and fat gain, glucose intolerance, hypertriglyceridemia, abnormal adipocytokine levels, hypertension, and adiponectin and leptin gene expression and epigenetic changes. Normal diet consumption by male offspring during the subsequent generation following paternal HFD exposure diminished whereas consumption for two generations completely abolished the effect of paternal HFD exposure on metabolic traits and adipocytokine promoter epigenetic changes in the offspring. The effects of paternal HFD exposure on offspring were relatively weaker than those following HFD exposure in utero. However, paternal HFD exposure had an additive metabolic effect for two generations, suggesting that both paternal and maternal nutrition might affect offspring metabolism through epigenetic modifications of adipocytokine genes for multiple generations."}

However, many factors, including voltage fluctuations, mechanical vibrations, and temperature changes, can cause the size and the stability of the X-ray focal spot to degrade. A new microfocus X-ray tube based on a point-like micro-target in which the X-ray target is irradiated with an unfocused electron beam was investigated. EGS4 Monte Carlo simulation code was employed for the calculation of the X-ray intensity produced from the point-like micro-target and the substrate. The effects of several arrangements of the target material, target and beam size were studied. The simulation results demonstrated that if the intensity of X-rays generated at the point-like target is greater than half of the X-ray intensity produced on the substrate, the X-ray focal spot is determined in part by the point-like target rather than by the electron beam in the conventional X-ray tube.

An enlarged glans putatively interacts with the female cloaca and may change the shape of her reproductive tract to facilitate insemination and increase the probability of fertilization. Here, we investigated the cellular-level properties of the glans and other inflatable phallic tissues associated with the sperm -conducting sulcus spermaticus in the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis). Using histochemical staining, we visualized and defined collagen and elastin fiber densities and orientations in these tissues. Extracellular matrix architectures provided insights about phallic glans material properties and how they may affect tissue strength and flexibility during inflation and in response to copulatory forces. We also investigated the potential sources of fluids that induce inflation in alligator phalli. Combining serial sectioning and three-dimensional reconstruction, we identified a pair of supracrucal plexus vascular bodies at the proximal end of the alligator phallus that extend distally adjacent to ventro-medial sulcus tissues. Together, our gross and histological examination of the American alligator phallic glans suggests that its tissues are arranged in a manner that would allow vascular inflation to expand the glans to a specific and repeatable shape, and potentially release secretory products into the female reproductive tract. Both elements could play roles in postcopulatory sexual selection, by mechanically and/or chemically affecting female reproductive physiology."}
{"document_id": "27257056_1", "text": "A novel role for poly(C) binding proteins in programmed ribosomal frameshifting Translational control through programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) is exploited widely by viruses and increasingly documented in cellular genes. Frameshifting is induced by mRNA secondary structures that compromise ribosome fidelity during decoding of a heptanucleotide 'slippery' sequence. The nsp2 PRF signal of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus is distinctive in directing both -2 and -1 PRF and in its requirement for a trans-acting protein factor, the viral replicase subunit nsp1\u03b2. Here we show that the the trans-activation of frameshifting is carried out by a protein complex composed of nsp1\u03b2 and a cellular poly(C) binding protein (PCBP). From the results of in vitro translation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we demonstrate that a PCBP / nsp1\u03b2 complex binds to a C-rich sequence downstream of the slippery sequence and here mimics the activity of a structured mRNA stimulator of PRF. This is the first description of a role for a trans-acting cellular protein in PRF. The discovery broadens the repertoire of activities associated with poly(C) binding proteins and prototypes a new class of virus - host interactions."}

The identity of the enolase was confirmed through mass spectrometric analysis that showed the characteristic 442 amino acid sequence with a molecular mass of 48.03 kDa. The enolase was not capable of using linoleic acid directly as a substrate but instead uses its hydroxyl derivative 10-hydroxi-12-cis-octadecenoic acid to finally form bioactive conjugated linoleic acid. Biochemical optimization studies were carried out to elucidate the conditions for maximum production of 9-cis-11-trans-CLA and maximum stability of \u03b1-enolase when catalyzing this reaction. Furthermore, through structural analysis of the protein, we propose the binding sites of substrate and product molecules that were characterized as two hydrophobic superficial pockets located at opposite ends of the enolase connected through a channel where the catalysis of dehydration and isomerization might occur. These results prove that multifunctional \u03b1-enolase also plays a role in cell detoxification from polyunsaturated fatty acids such as linoleic acid, along with the linoleate isomerase complex."}

In the present study, we investigated the sexual functioning of BC patients and its association with women's personal characteristics and cancer treatments. In this cross-sectional study, sexual function was assessed using the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). The health-related quality of life (HRQOL) was measured using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 and its breast module BR-23. Of the 235 participants approached, 216 participants were included in the study. Of these, 63 patients reported no sexual activity in the last month and thus were analyzed only in relation to the sexual desire domain of FSFI. A total of 154 (71.3 %) patients were classified with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD). From those patients reporting sexual activity in the last month, 63.3 % (97 out of 153) were classified with sexual dysfunction. Using hierarchical logistic regression, the variance explained (change in R (2)) by the addition of body mass index (BMI) and mild to moderate physical activity in the prediction models of sexual dysfunction and HSDD were 6.8 and 7.2 %, respectively. Age, BMI, and physical activity were independently associated with sexual dysfunction and HSDD. Additionally, BC patients with sexual dysfunction reported lower scores on global HRQOL, role functioning, and fatigue. Based on our findings, BC survivors should be encouraged to practice regular physical activity and to lose weight in order to avoid sexual dysfunction. However, future clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings."}

Several signaling pathways are involved in the pathogenesis of DN including elevation in level of angiotensin II, formation of advanced glycation end products (AGE), activation of protein kinase c (PKC), and lipid accumulation. These pathways activate one another mutually leading to oxidative stress, increasing expression of transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-\u03b2 1) and release of interleukins and adhesion molecules, so the aim of this study is to interrupt more than pathogenic pathway to ameliorate the progression of DN. In the present study, white male rats (N=48) were divided into six groups (8 rats each), the first two groups served as normal control and a control vehicle group while the remaining four groups were rendered diabetic by a single intraperitoneal injection of Streptozotocin (STZ) and being left for 4 weeks to develop DN. Thereafter, the rats were divided into DN group, DN group receiving Telmisartan or Sildenafil or Telmisartan Sildenafil combination. After the specified treatment period, urine samples were collected (using metabolic cages) to measure proteinuria, animals were then euthanized, blood and tissue samples were collected for measurement of Blood glucose, BUN, S.Cr, LDL, NO, TGF-\u03b21, IL-1\u03b2, AGEPs, and SOD. The combination therapy showed significant decrease in BUN, S.Cr, LDL, TGF-\u03b21, IL-1\u03b2, Proteinuria and AGEPs and significant increase in SOD and NO. The findings showed that combination therapy was able to ameliorate DN and that the effects were superior to the single drugs alone."}

Patients with lung cancer are usually diagnosed at advanced or locally advanced stage, for this reason early diagnosis of lung cancer is very important. For early detection of lung cancer some methods are emphasized such as low-dose computed tomography or tumor biomarkers. In this study we aimed to evaluate DR-70 sensitivity and specificity as a tumor marker in detection of non-small cell lung cancers. Between May 2013 and April 2014, the serum samples from 88 non lung cancer patients, 86 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disesase were obtained. Blood samples from each participant were analyzed for DR-70 level. Totally 174 patients were enrolled to the study (152 male, 22 female). Histopathologically 47(53.4%) patients were diagnosed with squamous cell lung cancer, 34 (38.6%) with adenocarcinoma, and 7 (8%) with non-small cell lung cancer. The mean serum DR-70 levels in lung cancer patients (2.43 \u00b1 1.82 \u00b5g/mL) was significantly higher compared to the 86 non-cancerous subjects (1.15 \u00b1 0.70 \u00b5g/mL) (p< 0.01). DR-70 exhibited clinical sensitivity and specificity of 54.5 and 83.7%, respectively, at an optimal cut off at 1.98 \u00b5g/mL. It could be said that the risk of the presence of the disease is 6.171 times higher in the cases where DR-70 level is 1.98 \u00b5g/mL and higher. DR-70, a marker used to measure fibrin degradation products, generated by all major cancers, may helps to find high risk lung cancer patients."}

However, few studies have been done to evaluate the affordability of rare disease patients in China. This study aims to provide policy recommendations for the establishment of social security mechanism for rare diseases in China, so as to address the problem of poverty caused by these diseases. A total of 7 rare diseases were selected by Delphi method. Affordability of treatment for the 7 rare diseases was assessed through annual per capital income, catastrophic expenditure and impoverishment expenditure among urban and rural residents in China. Assessed through annual per capital income, health expenditure for the 7 rare diseases are all rather high. The highest health expenditure is equivalent to income of 69.34 years of one urban resident, and the burden is heavier for rural residents. Through catastrophic expenditure assessment, proportions of the population experiencing catastrophic expenditure caused by the 7 rare diseases are all under 0.167 \u2030. However, once one is ill and taking medications, he will suffer from catastrophic health expenditure. Through impoverishment expenditure assessment, the proportions of impoverishment payment are low among both urban and rural residents, but the 7 rare diseases could lead nearly 4.6 million people into poverty on a national scale. The affordability of treatment for rare disease as well as orphan drugs is rather poor. Residents of different income levels all have difficulties to afford the treatment for rare diseases, so poverty caused by rare diseases is quite widespread. Therefore, social security mechanism for rare disease patients should be established and specific payment pattern for orphan drugs should be set up."}

A left lower lobectomy was performed to evaluate chronic-phase durability of the sealed stumps in a survival model. Two or three branches of the pulmonary arteries in each dog were allocated to each of the 3 groups. After the scheduled survival period, the pulmonary arteries were sampled. Pressure tolerance at the sealed end was evaluated in 91 pulmonary artery sections. All sealed ends showed pressure tolerance >75 mm Hg. A left lower lobectomy was performed in 13 dogs in which 35 pulmonary artery sections had been allocated into the 3 groups. No sealing failure was found, and pathological findings showed healing and persistent hemostasis at all sealed ends of the pulmonary arteries after 2 and 4 weeks of the survival period. Pulmonary arteries sealed in vivo with the Enseal device showed pressure tolerance >75 mm Hg in the acute phase, and persistent hemostasis after 2 or 4 weeks.

The review aims to summarize recent evidence on pathophysiology, treatment, and prevention of OHSS. The pathophysiology is still not completely understood; however, vascular endothelial growth factor is likely to be an important mediator. Human chorionic gonadotropin was previously thought to be necessary for OHSS to occur; however, recent case reports have proven otherwise. The contribution of an attenuated anti-Mullerian hormone signalling pathway and CD11c + HLA-DR + dendritic cells and associated interleukins has been explored recently as contributors to pathogenesis. Treatment is largely supportive and is based mainly on consensus statements rather than evidence. Therefore, it is important to prevent this condition by identifying women at risk, allowing the clinician to implement preventive strategies, including the use of GnRH antagonist cycles with agonist triggers. More research is required to elucidate the pathophysiology behind the condition. Clinicians should employ strategies to prevent OHSS."}

Sonourethrography (SUG) was introduced in 1988 to overcome the limitations of RUG and to provide more accurate results. As proper selection of imaging modality is very important for planning the treatment, various advances in this area are required. One of the major factors for recurrence of stricture disease is spongiofibrosis. Sonoelastography (SE) is a newer technique, tried in various other pathologies. In this study, we have used this technique for the first time to assess its efficacy in the evaluation of anterior urethral stricture disease by comparison with RUG and SUG. Between August 2014 and May 2015, 77 patients with clinical features of anterior urethral stricture disease were included in the study and evaluated by RUG followed by SUG and SE for stricture location, length, depth of spongiofibrosis and periurethral pathologies. The results were then correlated with operative and histopathological findings. Overall diagnostic accuracy of SE, SUG, and RGU for the estimation of stricture location, and length were estimated 92.68% vs. 91.54%, 79% vs. 78.87% and 80.48% vs. 43.66%, respectively, while for depth of spongiofibrosis SE, and SUG had accuracy rates of 87.3%, 48%, respectively. The mean length measured on SE was nearest to the mean intra-operative stricture length (21.34+11.8 mm). SE findings significantly correlated with the colour of bladder mucosa on cystoscopic examination (p=0.003) whereas the association was non-significant (p=0.127) for difficulty in incision. "}

Clinical data, imaging, surgical, and pathological findings of 51 women with breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant therapy were recorded. MBI findings were correlated with surgical pathology results. Accuracy of MBI in predicting complete pathological response and size of residual disease was assessed according to molecular subtypes. The size of the largest focus of uptake on MBI correlated with the largest dimension measured on pathology (r = 0.55; P < .001). This correlation was stronger for triple negative and HER2/neu positive subtypes (r = 0.92 and 0.62, respectively). Sixteen patients (31%) had complete pathological response. The sensitivity and specificity of MBI for detecting residual disease were 83% (95% confidence interval [CI], 66-93) and 69% (95% CI, 42-88), respectively. For triple negative or HER2/neu positive disease the sensitivity and specificity were 88% (95% CI, 62-98) and 75% (95% CI, 43-93), respectively.

We developed and validated a competing risk model to calculate likelihood of outcomes for kidney transplant candidates and demonstrate how this information differs from median time to transplant. Data were obtained from the US Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients. The retrospective cohort included 163 636 adults listed for kidney transplant before December 31, 2011. Predictors were age, sex, blood type, calculated panel-reactive antibodies, donation service area, dialysis duration, comorbid conditions, and body mass index. Outcomes were deceased or living donor transplant, death or removal from the list due to deteriorating medical condition, or removal due to other reasons. We calculated hazards for the possible outcomes, then the cumulative incidence function for a given candidate using competing risk methodology. Discrimination and calibration were assessed through C statistics and calibration plots for each cause - specific Cox proportional hazard model. C statistics ranged from 0.64 to 0.73. Calibration plots showed good calibration. The competing risk model shows probability of all possible outcomes for up to 12 years given a candidate's characteristics, contrasted with the median waiting time for that candidate's donation service area. A competing risk model conveys more relevant information than the median waiting time for a given transplant center.

Rodent models of CMT1A have been used to show that reducing Pmp22 overexpression mitigates several aspects of a CMT1A -related phenotype. Mechanistic studies of Pmp22 regulation identified enhancers regulated by the Sox10 (SRY sex determining region Y-box 10) and Egr2 / Krox20 (Early growth response protein 2) transcription factors in myelinated nerves. However, relatively little is known regarding how other transcription factors induce Pmp22 expression during Schwann cell development and myelination. Here, we examined Pmp22 enhancers as a function of cell type-specificity, nerve injury and development. While Pmp22 enhancers marked by active histone modifications were lost or remodeled after injury, we found that these enhancers were permissive in early development prior to Pmp22 upregulation. Pmp22 enhancers contain binding motifs for TEA domain (Tead) transcription factors of the Hippo signaling pathway. We discovered that Tead1 and co-activators Yap and Taz are required for Pmp22 expression, as well as for the expression of Egr2 Tead1 directly binds Pmp22 and Egr2 enhancers early in development and Tead1 binding is induced during myelination, correlating with Pmp22 expression.

Arsenic, a human carcinogen, is a high-affinity MRP1 substrate as arsenic triglutathione [As(GS)3]. In this study, marked differences in As(GS)3 transport kinetics were observed between MRP1 -enriched membrane vesicles prepared from human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK) (Km 3.8 \u00b5M and Vmax 307 pmol/mg per minute) and HeLa (Km 0.32 \u00b5M and Vmax 42 pmol/mg per minute) cells. Mutant MRP1 lacking N-linked glycosylation [Asn19/23/1006Gln; sugar-free (SF)-MRP1] expressed in either HEK293 or HeLa cells had low Km and Vmax values for As(GS)3, similar to HeLa wild-type (WT) MRP1. When prepared in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors, both WT- and SF-MRP1 -enriched membrane vesicles had a high Km value for As(GS)3 (3-6 \u00b5M), regardless of the cell line.

Well-developed SAR models exist for \u03b2-hematin inhibition, parasite activity, and cellular mechanisms for this compound class, but no comparably detailed investigations exist for other hemozoin inhibiting chemotypes. Here, benzamide analogues based on previous HTS hits have been purchased or synthesized. Only derivatives containing an electron deficient aromatic ring and capable of adopting flat conformations, optimal for \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions with Fe(III)PPIX, inhibited \u03b2-hematin formation. The two most potent analogues showed nanomolar parasite activity, with little CQ cross-resistance, low cytotoxicity, and high in vitro microsomal stability. Selected analogues inhibited hemozoin formation in Plasmodium falciparum causing high levels of free heme. In contrast to quinolines, introduction of amine side chains did not lead to benzamide accumulation in the parasite. These data reveal complex relationships between heme binding, free heme levels, cellular accumulation, and in vitro activity of potential novel antimalarials."}

Upon shear, the structures tilt, and exhibit an elastic response which is mostly governed by the electric energy. Assuming a two-dimensional stripe structure, we calculate the Maxwell stress, and derive an expression for the shear modulus, demonstrating how it depends on the external electric field, the composition, and the dielectric properties of the blend. We also suggest the notion of effective interfacial tension, which renormalizes the effect of the electric field. This leads to a simple derivation of the scaling law for the selection of the wavelength of the structure formed under an electric field."}

Their DNA-binding affinities and sequence specificities were evaluated by SPR and Bind-n-Seq analyses. The design of polyamide 1 was based on a conventional model, with three consecutive Py or Im rings separated by a \u03b2-alanine to match the curvature and twist of long DNA helices. Polyamides 2 and 3 contained an 8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoic acid (AO) unit, which has previously only been used as a linker within linear Py-Im polyamides or between Py - Im hairpin motifs for tandem hairpin. It is demonstrated herein that AO also functions as a linker element that can extend to 2-bp in hairpin motifs. Notably, although the AO -containing unit can fail to bind the expected sequence, polyamide 4, which has two AO units facing each other in a hairpin form, successfully showed the expected motif and a KD value of 16nM was recorded. Polyamide 5, containing a \u03b2-alanine-\u03b2-alanine unit instead of the AO of polyamide 2, was synthesized for comparison. The aqueous solubilities and nuclear localization of three of the polyamides were also examined. The results suggest the possibility of applying the AO unit in the core of Py-Im polyamide compounds."}

It presents serious challenges to the well-being of children in many African countries. Today, Sub-Saharan Africa alone accounts for about 50% of global child mortality. The overall objective of this study was to determine the magnitude and distribution of causes of death among children aged 5 to 14 year olds in the population of Kersa HDSS using verbal autopsy method for the period 2008 to 2013. Kersa Health and Demographic Surveillance System (Kersa HDSS) was established in September 2007. The center consists of 10 rural and 2 urban kebeles which were selected randomly from 38 kebeles in the district. Thus this study was conducted in Kersa HDSS and data was taken from Kersa HDSS database. The study population included all children aged 5 to 14 years registered during the period of 2008 to 2013 in Kersa HDSS using age specific VA questionnaires. Data were extracted from SPSS database and analyzed using STATA. A total of 229 deaths were recorded over the period of six years with a crude death rate of 219.6 per 100,000 population of this age group over the study period. This death rate was 217.5 and 221.5 per 100,000 populations for females and males, respectively. 75% of deaths took place at home. The study identified severe malnutrition (33.9%), intestinal infectious diseases (13.8%) and acute lower respiratory infections (9.2%) to be the three most leading causes of death. In broad causes of death classification, injuries have been found to be the second most cause of death next to communicable diseases (56.3%) attributing to 13.1% of the total deaths. In specific causes of death classification severe malnutrition, intestinal infectious diseases and acute lower respiratory infections were the three leading causes of death where, in broad causes of death communicable diseases and injuries were among the leading causes of death. Hence, concerned bodies should take measures to avert the situation of mortality from these causes of death and further inferential analysis into the prevention and management of infectious diseases should also be taken."}

We therefore investigated the phenotypic and functional differences among in vitro activated CD8(+) T cells of three different sources, namely na\u00efve (NTeff), memory (MTeff) and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILeff) from human and mice, to better understand mechanisms behind potent effector functions and potential for overcoming current limitations. In line with the greater proliferation activity and longer telomere lengths of NTeff populations, cells of na\u00efve origin exhibited significantly less amounts of T cell exhaustion markers than those of MTeff and TILeff, and moreover, acquired distinct expression patterns of memory-promoting transcription factors, T-bet and Eomes, induced in a rapid and sustainable manner. NTeff cells appeared to have lower expression of Foxp1 and were refractory to apoptosis upon TGF-\u03b2 conditioning, implying better survival potential and resistance to tumor - induced immune suppression. Of CD8(+) T cell pools activated to tumor - specific CTLs, na\u00efve cell generated effectors possessed the most potent cytotoxic activity, validating implications for use in rational design of adoptive immunotherapy."}

In this prospective longitudinal study, conducted in 2014-2015, 55 women diagnosed with BC, with a mean age 51.5\u00b110.1 years, were followed and data were collected at three different times. Anthropometric and dietary assessments were performed, the latter by applying nine 24h dietary recall s, by using the Brazilian Healthy Eating Index Revised (BHEI-R), and calculating the prevalence of inadequacy by the EAR cut-off point method. Regarding the BHEI-R analysis, the majority of women had a \" diet requires modification ', both at the beginning (T0, 58.2%, n = 32) and during treatment (T1, 54.5%, n = 30). However, after the end of the CT, the greater percentage of patients (T2, 49.1%, n = 27) were classified as having an \" inadequate diet \", since the Total Fruit consumption as well as the Dark Green and Orange Vegetable and Legume consumption decreased significantly during treatment (p = 0.043 and p = 0.026, respectively).

Endocrine dysfunction after TBI is thought to result from acceleration - deceleration forces to the brain within the skull, creating enduring hypothalamic and pituitary neuropathology, and subsequent hypothalamic -pituitary endocrine (HPE) dysfunction. These experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that a single diffuse TBI results in chronic dysfunction of corticosterone (CORT), a glucocorticoid released in response to stress and testosterone. We used a rodent model of diffuse TBI induced by midline fluid percussion injury (mFPI). At 2 months postinjury compared with uninjured control animals, circulating levels of CORT were evaluated at rest, under restraint stress and in response to dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid commonly used to test HPE axis regulation. Testosterone was evaluated at rest. Further, we assessed changes in injury - induced neuron morphology (Golgi stain), neuropathology (silver stain) and activated astrocytes (GFAP) in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. Resting plasma CORT levels were decreased at 2 months postinjury and there was a blunted CORT increase in response to restraint induced stress. No changes in testosterone were measured. These changes in CORT were observed concomitantly with altered complexity of neuron processes in the PVN over time, devoid of neuropathology or astrocytosis. Results provide evidence that a single moderate diffuse TBI leads to changes in CORT function, which can contribute to the persistence of symptoms related to endocrine dysfunction. Future experiments aim to evaluate additional HP-related hormones and endocrine circuit pathology following diffuse TBI."}

Intake of MCD for 3 wk resulted in a significant accumulation of hepatic lipids, which was prevented by betaine supplementation in drinking water (1%). Phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c), and liver kinase B1 (LKB1) was inhibited by MCD intake, and these changes were all inhibited by betaine feeding. Meanwhile, betaine supplementation reversed the reduction of methionine and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), and the elevation of homocysteine levels in the liver, which could be attributable to the induction of betaine-homocysteine methyltransfease (BHMT) and methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT). Different cell lines were used to clarify the role of homocysteine on activation of the AMPK pathway. Homocysteine treatment decreased pAMPK, pACC, pSREBP-1c and pLKB1 in HepG2 cells. Metformin - induced activation of AMPK was also inhibited by homocysteine. Treatment with hydroxylamine, a cystathionine \u03b2-synthase inhibitor, resulted in a reduction of pAMPK, pACC and pSREBP-1c, accompanied by an elevation of intracellular homocysteine.

Bassoon and Piccolo are active zone specific cytosolic proteins essential for active zone assembly in NMJs, ribbon synapses, and brain synapses. These proteins are thought to colocalize and share some functions at active zones. Here, we report an unexpected finding of non-overlapping localization of these two proteins in mouse NMJs revealed using dual-color stimulated emission depletion (STED) super resolution microscopy. Piccolo puncta sandwiched Bassoon puncta and aligned in a Piccolo - Bassoon - Piccolo structure in adult NMJs. P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) puncta colocalized with Bassoon puncta. The P/Q-type VGCC and Bassoon protein levels decreased significantly in NMJs from aged mouse. In contrast, the Piccolo levels in NMJs from aged mice were comparable to levels in adult mice. This study revealed the molecular architecture of active zones in mouse NMJs at sub-diffraction limited resolution, and described the selective degeneration mechanism of active zone proteins in NMJs from aged mice.

Consequently, biomarkers associated with TRD are still lacking. This study aimed to use recently advanced high-throughput proteomic platforms to identify peripheral biomarkers of TRD defined by two staging models, the Thase and Rush staging model (TRM) and the Maudsley Staging Model (MSM). Serum collected from an inpatient cohort of 65 individuals suffering from MDD was analysed using two different mass spectrometric-based platforms, label-free liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS(E)) and selective reaction monitoring (SRM), as well as a multiplex bead based assay. In the LC-MS(E) analysis, proteins involved in the acute phase response and complement activation and coagulation were significantly different between the staging groups in both models. In the multiplex bead-based assay analysis TNF-\u03b1 levels (log(odds) = -4.95, p = 0.045) were significantly different in the TRM comparison. Using SRM, significant changes of three apolipoproteins A-I (\u03b2 = 0.029, p = 0.035), M (\u03b2 = -0.017, p = 0.009) and F (\u03b2 = -0.031, p = 0.024) were associated with the TRM but not the MSM. Overall, our findings suggest that proteins, which are involved in immune and complement activation, may represent potential biomarkers that could be used by clinicians to identify high-risk patients. Nevertheless, given that the molecular changes between the staging groups were subtle, the results need to be interpreted cautiously."}

Starting from the knowledge that the main fraction of atmospheric aerosol in Rome is characterized by significant levels of PM2.5 (almost 75% of PM10 fraction is PM2.5), the paper is focused on submicron particles in such great urban area. The daytime / nighttime, work- / weekdays and cold / hot seasonal trends of submicron particles will be investigated and discussed along with NOx and total PAH drifts demonstrating the primary origin of UFPs from combustion processes. Furthermore, moving from these data, the total dose of submicron particles deposited in the respiratory system (i.e., head, tracheobronchial and alveolar regions in different lung lobes) has been estimated. Dosimeter estimates were performed with the Multiple-Path Particle Dosimetry model (MPPD v.2.1). The paper discusses the aerosol doses deposited in the respiratory system of individuals exposed in proximity of traffic. During traffic peak hours, about 6.6 \u00d7 10(10) particles are deposited into the respiratory system. Such dose is almost entirely made of UFPs.

Correlation coefficients for the actual and estimated age were calculated for the tool overall and individual components. The correlation coefficient between the actual and estimated age from the AAT was very strong at 0.9802 (boys 0.9748, girls 0.9876). The oral narrative component of the tool performed best (R = 0.9603). Overall, 86.7% of age estimates were within 1 year of the true age. The range of differences was -1.43 to 3.92 years with a standard deviation of 0.77 years (9.24 months).

In a first step, controlled mixtures of preformed micelles and vesicles have been characterized both by dynamic light scattering and asymmetrical flow field flow fractionation (AsFlFFF). For this, a custom-made program, STORMS, was developed to analyze DLS data in a thorough manner by providing a large set of fitting parameters. This showed that DLS only sensed the larger vesicles when the micelles / vesicles ratio was 80/20 w/w. On the other hand, AsFlFFF allowed clear detection of the presence of micelles when this same ratio was as low as 10/90. Subsequently, the photodynamic therapy efficiency of various controlled mixtures was assessed using multicellular spheroids when a photosensitizer, pheophorbide a, was encapsulated in the polymer self-assemblies. Some mixtures were shown to be as efficient as monomorphous systems. In some cases, mixtures were found to exhibit a higher PDT efficiency compared to the individual nano - objects, revealing a synergistic effect for the efficient delivery of the photosensitizer.

These changes occurred through an ongoing \"tuning\" with Swedish society, in which the profession strove to appear relevant to society's concerns and problems as well as enroll others to share the profession's goals and aims. Studying the history of the profession can thus shed light on the changing definitions and contours of the psychology profession itself as well as on the organization of the society in which it acts. This article examines the history of the Swedish psychology profession from 1990 to 2010, through an analysis of the discussions and debates taking place in the Swedish Psychological Association's journal. The analytical framework used draws on work done within actor-network theory and science studies. We argue that the profession's institutional connections, defining tasks, epistemological underpinnings, and social position have changed in major ways during these 2 decades. Overall, as a result of an increasingly felt insecurity, the profession has turned outward and tried to find new ways to legitimize itself to politicians, the media, patients, and customers through means such as a more economized vocabulary and novel forms of empirical research. These changes have led to a more socialized profession, now more closely tuned to other actors in Swedish society, leading to conflicts within the profession over whether this is an opportunity to better control their own destiny or if it will lead to a loss of autonomy.

Hospice staff may benefit from the use of personal rituals as they cope with the frequent deaths of their patients, ultimately aiming to provide compassionate care while minimizing burnout. This study investigated the role of personally meaningful rituals in increasing compassion and decreasing burnout among hospice staff and volunteers. An online survey was completed by members of the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (NHPCO) which inquired about personal ritual practices, and included the Professional Quality of Life (ProQOL) scale to measure current levels of Compassion Satisfaction, Burnout, and Secondary Traumatic Stress. Three hundred ninety hospice staff and volunteers from across 38 states completed the online survey. The majority of participants were Caucasian and female, with an average of nine years of experience in hospice and palliative care. The majority of hospice staff and volunteers used personally meaningful rituals after the death of their patients to help them cope (71%). Those who used rituals demonstrated significantly higher Compassion Satisfaction and significantly lower Burnout as measured by the ProQOL, with professional support, social support, and age playing significant roles as well. Rituals may be an important way to increase compassion and decrease burnout among hospice staff and volunteers. Organizations may benefit from providing training and support for personalized rituals among team members, especially new staff who may be at greater risk for burnout."}

However, little is known about the involvement of this receptor in metastasis. Here, we show that elevated GPR55 expression in human tumors is associated with the aggressive basal / triple-negative breast cancer population, higher probability to develop metastases, and therefore poor patient prognosis. Activation of GPR55 by its proposed endogenous ligand lysophosphatidylinositol confers pro-invasive features on breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Specifically, this effect is elicited by coupling to Gq/11 heterotrimeric proteins and the subsequent activation, through ERK, of the transcription factor ETV4 / PEA3. Together, these data show that GPR55 promotes breast cancer metastasis, and supports the notion that this orphan receptor may constitute a new therapeutic target and potential biomarker in the highly aggressive triple-negative subtype."}

However, traditional methods to inactivate browning may induce more unexpected risks than ultrasonic processing. Meanwhile, there are no reports on the effect of ultrasound on PPO directly purified from sweet melon. The PPO in the original juice was less inactivated than the purified form when treated with ultrasound. As for purified PPO, superior to thermal treatment, less heat was needed to inactivate the PPO with ultrasonic treatment. At intensity lower than 200 W, ultrasound did not significantly affect the structure and activity of PPO (P > 0.05), and latent PPO was activated. At intensity higher than 200 W, ultrasound inactivated PPO, induced aggregation and dissociation of PPO particles and significantly decreased the \u03b1-helix structure content. Low-frequency high-intensity ultrasound caused an inactivation effect and conformational changes of purified PPO from oriental sweet melons. Changes in the PPO structure induced by ultrasound eventually inactivated the enzyme. Ultrasound may be a potential method to inactivate PPO in oriental sweet melons. \u00a9 2016 Society of Chemical Industry."}

We explored the phylogeography of a protected moth, Graellsia isabellae, and its two recognised host-plant species (Pinus sylvestris and P. nigra) in order to seek for any concordance useful to disentangle the evolutionary history of this iconic lepidopteran. DNA variation in one mitochondrial marker and nine nuclear microsatellite loci revealed a strong phylogeographic pattern across 28 populations of G. isabellae studied in Spain and France comprising six groups mostly distributed along different mountain ranges. Reanalysis of a previously published chloroplast microsatellite dataset revealed a three and two- group structure for Spanish P. sylvestris and P. nigra, respectively. Overall, the population groupings of this protected moth did not match the ones of P. sylvestris and P. nigra. There was no evidence of host - associated differentiation between populations using P. sylvestris and the ones inhabiting P. nigra. The two major mitochondrial clades of G. isabellae likely diverged before the Last Glacial Maximum and geographically separated the species into a \" southern \" (Central and Southern Iberian clusters) and a \" northern \" lineage (Eastern Iberian, Pyrenean and French Alpine clusters). The Eastern Iberian System, where this insect uses both host-plants, harboured the highest level of genetic diversity. Such a group independently colonised the West and East parts of the Pyrenees. Our results point to a native origin for the French populations occurring in the Alps, genetically related to the Eastern Iberian and Pyrenean sites. The Central Iberian group derived from Southern Iberian ancestors. Secondary contacts were inferred between the Southern/Central Iberian populations and Eastern Iberian cluster as well as between the two Pyrenean ones. The mito-nuclear discordance observed with regard to the Eastern Iberian cluster is congruent with a secondary contact after the evolution of mito-nuclear incompatibilities in geographically isolated areas."}

The goal of this study was to determine the effect of carboxymethyl chitosan on mixed biofilm formation of fungi and bacteria on silicone over a long-term period. Mixed species biofilms of Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Lactobacillus gasseri, Streptococcus salivarius, Rothia dentocariosa, and Staphylococcus epidermidis were cultivated on the surfaces of medical-grade silicone with and without addition of carboxymethyl chitosan. Biofilm kinetics was monitored using specially designed image analysis software to calculate the percentual surface covering of each platelet. Biofilm architecture was investigated by scanning electron microscopy. A cover of living mixed biofilm could be generated over 22 days on silicone and the maximum of 22% biofilm surface covering at day 22. However, less than 4% surface coverage was observed on the carboxymethyl chitosan - treated plates in the testing period. Scanning electron microscopy confirms that, on surfaces treated by carboxymethyl chitosan, the biofilm was less dense. In addition, there were fewer layers of cells and profuse cellular debris, together with degrading and morphologically altered yeast cells.

Recently, it has been suggested that conscious perception might arise from the dynamic interplay of functionally specialized but widely distributed cortical areas. While previous research mainly focused on phase coupling as a correlate of cortical communication, more recent findings indicated that additional coupling modes might coexist and possibly subserve distinct cortical functions. Here, we studied two coupling modes, namely phase and envelope coupling, which might differ in their origins, putative functions and dynamics. Therefore, we recorded 128-channel EEG while participants performed a bistable motion task and utilized state-of-the-art source-space connectivity analysis techniques to study the functional relevance of different coupling modes for cortical communication. Our results indicate that gamma-band phase coupling in extrastriate visual cortex might mediate the integration of visual tokens into a moving stimulus during ambiguous visual stimulation. Furthermore, our results suggest that long-range fronto-occipital gamma-band envelope coupling sustains the horizontal percept during ambiguous motion perception. Additionally, our results support the idea that local parieto-occipital alpha-band phase coupling controls the inter- hemispheric information transfer. These findings provide correlative evidence for the notion that synchronized oscillatory brain activity reflects the processing of sensory input as well as the information integration across several spatiotemporal scales. The results indicate that distinct coupling modes are involved in different cortical computations and that the rich spatiotemporal correlation structure of the brain might constitute the functional architecture for cortical processing and specific multi-site communication.

Alkaline phosphatase expression (ALP) was used to quantify osteoblastic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cell. Surface roughness was evaluated by a contact profilometer (URFPAK-SV; Mitutoyo, Kawasaki, Japan) and characterized by two parameters: mean roughness (Ra) and maximum peak-to-valley height (Rt). Scanning electron microscope revealed that MSLA (control group) surface was not as rough as LT, LAT surface (test groups). Alkaline phosphatase expression, the measure of osteoblastic differentiation, and total ALP expression by surface-adherent cells were found to be highest at 21 days for all three surfaces tested (P<.05). Furthermore, ALP expression levels of MSLA and LAT surfaces were significantly higher than expression levels of LT surface-adherent cells at 7, 14, and 21 days, respectively (P<.05).

Myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) proteins are reported that they have the potential contributions to adult muscle regeneration. In order to further understand Mef2c gene, the promoter of pig Mef2c gene was analyzed in this paper. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed the expression pattern of Mef2c gene in muscle of eight tissues. The Mef2c promoter had the higher transcriptional activity in differentiated C2C12 cells than that in proliferating C2C12 cells, which was accompanied by the up-regulation of mRNA expression of Mef2c gene. Function deletion and mutation analyses showed that MyoD and MEF2 binding sites within the Mef2c promoter were responsible for the regulation of Mef2c transcription. MEF2C could up-regulate the transcriptional activities of Mef2c promoter constructs which contained a 3'-end nucleotide sequence with p300 binding site. The Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays determined the MyoD binding site in Mef2c promoter. These results advanced our knowledge of the promoter of the pig Mef2c gene.

Such studies have the potential to provide mechanistic insight into the development of diabetic bladder disorder (DBD). In the present study, we compared the metabolome of detrusor and urothelial layer in a 1-mo streptozotocin -induced rat model of type 1 diabetes with nondiabetic controls. Our studies revealed that diabetes caused both common and differential changes in the detrusor and urothelial layer's metabolome. Diabetes resulted in similar changes in the levels of previously described diabetic markers in both tissues, such as glucose, lactate, 2-hydroxybutyrate, branched-chain amino acid degradation products, bile acids, and 1,5-anhydroglucitol, as well as markers of oxidative stress. In the detrusor (but not the urothelial layer), diabetes caused activation of the pentose-phosphate and polyol pathways, concomitant with a reduction in the TCA cycle and \u03b2-oxidation. Changes in detrusor energy-generating pathways resulted in an accumulation of sorbitol that, through generation of advanced glycation end products, is likely to play a central role in the development of DBD. In the diabetic urothelial layer there was decreased flux of glucose via glycolysis and changes in lipid metabolism, particularly prostaglandin synthesis, which also potentially contributes to detrusor dysfunction."}

Earthworms are important for maintaining soil ecosystem functioning and serve as indicators of soil fertility. However, detection of earthworms is time-consuming, which hinders the assessment of earthworm abundances with high sampling density over entire fields. Recent developments of mobile terrestrial sensor platforms for proximal soil sensing (PSS) provided new tools for collecting dense spatial information of soils using various sensing principles. Yet, the potential of PSS for assessing earthworm habitats is largely unexplored. This study investigates whether PSS data contribute to the spatial prediction of earthworm abundances in species distribution models of agricultural soils. Proximal soil sensing data, e.g., soil electrical conductivity (EC), pH, and near infrared absorbance (NIR), were collected in real-time in a field with two management strategies (reduced tillage / conventional tillage) and sandy to loam soils. PSS was related to observations from a long-term (11 years) earthworm observation study conducted at 42 plots. Earthworms were sampled from 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.2 m\u00b3 soil blocks and identified to species level. Sensor data were highly correlated with earthworm abundances observed in reduced tillage but less correlated with earthworm abundances observed in conventional tillage. This may indicate that management influences the sensor - earthworm relationship. Generalized additive models and state-space models showed that modelling based on data fusion from EC, pH, and NIR sensors produced better results than modelling without sensor data or data from just a single sensor. Regarding the individual earthworm species, particular sensor combinations were more appropriate than others due to the different habitat requirements of the earthworms. Earthworm species with soil -specific habitat preferences were spatially predicted with higher accuracy by PSS than more ubiquitous species. Our findings suggest that PSS contributes to the spatial modelling of earthworm abundances at field scale and that it will support species distribution modelling in the attempt to understand the soil - earthworm relationships in agroecosystems."}

Intrinsic brain activity has been increasingly recognized as an important functional activity mode and is tightly linked with various cognitive functions. Structurally, cognitive functions have also shown a relation with brain volume / size. Therefore, an association between intrinsic brain activities and brain volume / size can be hypothesized, and brain volume / size may impact intrinsic brain activity in human brains. The present study aimed to explicitly investigate this brain structure - function relationship using two large independent cohorts of 176 and 236 young adults. Structural - MRI was performed to estimate the brain volume, and resting-state functional-MRI was applied to extract the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF), an imaging measure of intrinsic brain activity. Intriguingly, our results revealed a robust linear correlation between whole-brain size and ALFF. Moreover, specific brain lobes / regions, including the frontal lobe, the left middle frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate gyrus, Rolandic operculum, and insula, also showed a reliable, positive volume - ALFF correlation in the two cohorts. These findings offer direct, empirical evidence of a strong association between brain size / volume and intrinsic brain activity, as well as provide novel insight into the structural substrates of the intrinsic brain activity of the human brain."}

Emotional events trigger automatic approach and avoidance tendencies. Although these actions may be generally adaptive, the capacity to override these emotional reactions may be key to flexible behavior during social interaction. The present chapter provides a review of the neuroendocrine mechanisms underlying this ability and their relation to social psychopathologies. Aberrant social behavior, such as observed in social anxiety or psychopathy, is marked by abnormalities in approach-avoidance tendencies and the ability to control them. Key neural regions involved in the regulation of approach-avoidance behavior are the amygdala, widely implicated in automatic emotional processing, and the anterior prefrontal cortex, which exerts control over the amygdala. Hormones, especially testosterone and cortisol, have been shown to affect approach-avoidance behavior and the associated neural mechanisms. The present chapter also discusses ways to directly influence social approach and avoidance behavior and will end with a research agenda to further advance this important research field. Control over approach-avoidance tendencies may serve as an exemplar of emotional action regulation and might have a great value in understanding the underlying mechanisms of the development of affective disorders."}

After briefly summarizing the magnitude and spread of cigarette consumption in the country, the paper reviews some empirical estimates from African and other countries. The 2008 Tanzanian household budget survey was used to estimate the demand for cigarettes in Tanzania. The descriptive statistics suggest that the smoking prevalence for Tanzania is 15.35 percent with low variability across expenditure (income) groups. Smoking intensity and per capita consumption were estimated at 7.08 cigarettes and 1.33 cigarettes, respectively, a relatively low value. A two-part demand equation model was used to estimate various elasticities. For the overall equation, the price elasticities of smoking participation, smoking intensity, and total elasticity were estimated at -0.879, -0.853, and -1.732, respectively. Compared to similar results in other developing countries, the estimates appear quite high. When estimated by expenditure (income) groups, the magnitude of the elasticity appears higher among high expenditure groups than among low expenditure groups. Two simulation exercises were undertaken. First, the effect of different excise rates on smoking participation rate, cigarette consumption, tax revenue, and related responses was estimated and highlighted. Second, the same exercise was undertaken to determine the effect of a given increase in the cigarette excise tax on various expenditure groups. The overall results suggest that an increase in the excise tax on cigarettes in Tanzania would reduce cigarette consumption and increase government tax revenue."}

Patients in group dexketoprofen (DT) received IV 50 mg dexketoprofen, group lornoxicam (LR) received IV 8 mg lornoxicam, group diclophenac sodium (DS) received 75 mg IV diclophenac sodium and group saline (S) received 0.9% saline in 2 mL syringes, 20 min before the end of anaesthesia. A standardized (1 mg kg(-1)) dose of tramadol was routinely administered to all patients as the loading dose at the end of surgery. Postoperatively, whenever patients requested, they were allowed to use a tramadol patient-controlled analgesia device giving a bolus dose (0.2 mg kg(-1)) of tramadol. Pain, discomfort, and sedation scores, cumulative tramadol consumption, supplemental meperidine requirement, and side effects were recorded. Visual rating scale and patient discomfort scores were significantly lower in DT, LR and DS groups compared to those in in group S (p<0.001). Cumulative tramadol consumption was significantly lower in non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)- treated groups at each study period after the second postoperative hour than in group S (p<0.001).

They reported that Mr X was in support of this arrangement. Eventually we told the family about Mr X's diagnosis, and they asserted their collective will to keep this information from him, reaffirming that all medical discussion go through them. However, the doctor in charge explained the diagnosis to Mr X using an interpreter while his family were away from his bed.

Multiple conditioning methods can be used for CER to adjust for group differences, including difference-in-differences (DiD) estimation. This study presents DiD and demonstrates how to apply this conditioning method to estimate treatment outcomes in the CER setting by utilizing the MarketScan\u00ae Databases for multiple sclerosis (MS) patients receiving different therapies. The sample included 6762 patients, with 363 in the Test Cohort [glatiramer acetate (GA) switched to fingolimod (FTY)] and 6399 in the Control Cohort (GA only, no switch) from a US administrative claims database. A trend analysis was conducted to rule out concerns regarding regression to the mean and to compare relapse rates among treatment cohorts. DiD analysis was used to enable comparisons among the Test and Control Cohorts. Logistic regression was used to estimate the probability of relapse after switching from GA to FTY, and to compare group differences in the pre - and post - index periods. Crude DiD analysis showed that in the pre - index period more patients in the Test Cohort experienced an MS relapse and had a higher mean number of relapses than in the Control Cohort. During the pre - index period, numeric and relative data for MS relapses in patients in the Test Cohort were significantly higher than in the Control Cohort, while no significant between- group differences emerged during the post - index period. Generalized linear modeling with DiD regression estimation showed that the mean number of MS relapses decreased significantly in the post - index period among patients in the Test Cohort compared with patients in the Control Cohort. In this study, an MS population was utilized to demonstrate how DiD can be applied to estimate treatment effects in a heterogeneous population, where the Test and Control Cohorts varied greatly. The results show that DiD offers a robust method for comparing diverse cohorts when other risk-adjustment methods may not be adequate."}

Analysis of (1)H NMR was shown that the models were grouped successfully, illustrating that all of them had significant differences. Based on the highly simple, accurate, non-targeted and non-destructively advantages of (1)H NMR, it could be used as a new screening tool of anti-inflammatory drugs in the metabolic profiling of GPLs. 58 GPLs were identified by U-HPLC / Q-TOF-MS, and 19 components were firstly identified in this study compared with our previous results. In addition, ten potential biomarkers were proved, of which phosphatidylcholine (PC) (16:0/18:1) and (18:0/18:1) changed consistently in three drug-induced groups and might be the important biomarkers. Compared with (1)H NMR, U-HPLC / Q-TOF-MS showed higher sensitivity and specificity and was more suitable for the determination of biomarkers apart from the deficiency of time-consuming sample preparation steps and unambiguous metabolite identification. Therefore, it is feasible to analyze the changes of GPLs during inflammation by combining (1)H NMR spectroscopy with U-HPLC / Q-TOF-MS. The metabolic profiling of GPLs provides valuable evidence for inflammation diagnosis and prognosis, and might unravel the mechanisms involved in inflammation progression."}

Although its mechanism of action, breeding, and fermentation had been extensively characterized, less is known about the regulatory functions that affect its biosynthesis or morphological development. The wysR3 gene of S. ahygroscopicus strain CK-15, a novel member of the DeoR family of regulatory genes, was assessed to determine its function by gene knockdown. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that DeoR family proteins derived from the same source are likely to be a single branch in a phylogenetic tree and show that wysR3 acts as a repressor for its morphological development without effecting wuyiencin production. We found that the \u0394wysR3 strain can grow quickly to reach a plateau stage of maximum biomass at 60 h, which is ~12 h faster than the wild-type strain.

Hence, the time has come to utilize novel approaches, particularly those drawing upon contemporary advances in fields outside of established neuroscienc e and psychiatry. Put another way, the time has come for a paradigm shift in the addiction sciences. Apropos, a revolution in the area of human health is underway, which is occurring at the nexus between enteric microbiology and neuroscience. It has become increasingly clear that the human microbiota (the vast ecology of bacteria residing within the human organism), plays an important role in health and disease. This is not surprising, as it has been estimated that bacteria living in the human body (approximately 1kg of mass, roughly equivalent to that of the human brain) outnumber human cells 10 to 1. While advances in the understanding of the role of microbiota in other areas of human health have yielded intriguing results (e.g., Clostridium difficile, irritable bowel syndrome, autism, etc.), to date, no systematic programs of research have examined the role of microbiota in drug addiction. The current hypothesis, therefore, is that gut dysbiosis plays a key role in addictive disorders. In the context of this hypothesis, this paper provides a rationale for future research to target the \" gut - brain axis \" in addiction. A brief background of the gut - brain axis is provided, along with a series of hypothesis-driven ideas outlining potential treatments for addiction via manipulations of the \" ecology within.\""}

Given the proposed role of this form of structural plasticity in the functioning of the hippocampus (namely learning and memory and affective behaviors), it is believed that alterations in hippocampal neurogenesis might underlie some of the behavioral deficits associated with these psychiatric and neurological conditions. Thus, the search for compounds that can reverse these deficits with minimal side effects has become a recognized priority. In the present study we tested the pro-neurogenic effects of isoxazole 9 (Isx-9), a small synthetic molecule that has been recently identified through the screening of chemical libraries in stem cell-based assays. We found that administration of Isx-9 for 14days was able to potentiate cell proliferation and increase the number of immature neurons in the hippocampal DG of adult rats. In addition, Isx-9 treatment was able to completely reverse the marked reduction in these initial stages of the neurogenic process observed in vehicle - treated animals (which were submitted to repeated handling and exposure to daily intraperitoneal injections). Based on these results, we recommend that future neurogenesis studies that require repeated handling and manipulation of animals should include a na\u00efve (non-manipulated) control to determine the baseline levels of hippocampal cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation. Overall, these findings demonstrate that Isx-9 is a promising synthetic compound for the mitigation of stress - induced deficits in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Future studies are thus warranted to evaluate the pro-neurogenic properties of Isx-9 in animal models of affective and neurological disorders associated with impaired hippocampal structural plasticity."}

We conducted an in-depth qualitative study with 37 parents of young people who had self-harmed in which we explored how and why their parenting changed after the discovery of self-harm. Early on, parents often found themselves \"walking on eggshells\" so as not to upset their child, but later they felt more able to take some control. Parents ' reactions to the self-harm often depended on how they conceptualised it: as part of adolescence, as a mental health issue or as \" naughty behaviour \". Parenting of other children in the family could also be affected, with parents worrying about less of their time being available for siblings. Many parents developed specific strategies they felt helped them to be more effective parents, such as learning to avoid blaming themselves or their child for the self-harm and developing new ways to communicate with their child. Parents were generally eager to pass their knowledge on to other people in the same situation. Parents reported changes in their parenting behaviours after the discovery of a child 's self-harm.

As an important part of the maize leaf, the midrib holds leaf blades in the aerial position for maximum sunlight capture. Leaf midrib s of adult plants contain substantial sclerenchyma cells with heavily thickened and lignified secondary walls and have a high amount of phenolics, making protein extraction and proteome analysis difficult in leaf midrib tissue. In the present study, three protein-extraction methods that are commonly used in plant proteomics, i.e., phenol extraction, TCA / acetone extraction, and TCA / acetone / phenol extraction, were qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated based on 2DE maps and MS/MS analysis using the midribs of the 10th newly expanded leaves of maize plants. Microscopy revealed the existence of substantial amounts of sclerenchyma underneath maize midrib epidermises (particularly abaxial epidermises). The spot-number order obtained via 2DE mapping was as follows: phenol extraction (655) > TCA / acetone extraction (589) > TCA / acetone / phenol extraction (545). MS/MS analysis identified a total of 17 spots that exhibited 2-fold changes in abundance among the three methods (using phenol extraction as a control). Sixteen of the proteins identified were hydrophilic, with GRAVY values ranging from -0.026 to -0.487. For all three methods, we were able to obtain high-quality protein samples and good 2DE maps for the maize leaf midrib. However, phenol extraction produced a better 2DE map with greater resolution between spots, and TCA / acetone extraction produced higher protein yields. Thus, this paper includes a discussion regarding the possible reasons for differential protein extraction among the three methods. This study provides useful information that can be used to select suitable protein extraction methods for the proteome analysis of recalcitrant plant tissues that are rich in sclerenchyma cells."}

In a previous fTCD study of hearing native signers (Gutierrez-Sigut, Daws, et al., 2015) we found stronger left lateralization for sign than speech. Given that this increased lateralization could not be explained by hand movement alone, the contribution of motor movement versus ' linguistic ' processes to the strength of hemispheric lateralization during sign production remains unclear. Here we directly contrast lateralization strength of covert versus overt signing during phonological and semantic fluency tasks. To address the possibility that hearing native signers ' elevated lateralization indices (LIs) were due to performing a task in their less dominant language, here we test deaf native signers, whose dominant language is British Sign Language (BSL). Signers were more strongly left lateralized for overt than covert sign generation. However, the strength of lateralization was not correlated with the amount of time producing movements of the right hand. Comparisons with previous data from hearing native English speakers suggest stronger laterality indices for sign than speech in both covert and overt tasks. This increased left lateralization may be driven by specific properties of sign production such as the increased use of self-monitoring mechanisms or the nature of phonological encoding of signs."}

In this study, we investigated the effect of crude oil on denitrification and anammox. Controlled laboratory experiments were performed using sediment slurries from the Lima Estuary (NW Portugal). Anammox and denitrification rates were measured using (15)N-labeled NO3(-), and the production of (29)N2 and (30)N2 quantified by membrane inlet mass spectrometry. Results revealed that while denitrification rates were stimulated between 10 and 25 000 times after crude oil amendment, anammox activity was partially (between 2 and 5 times) or completely inhibited by the addition of crude oil when comparing to rates in unamended controls. Similar results were observed across four estuarine sediment types, despite their different physical-chemical characteristics. Moreover, N2O production was reduced by 2-36 times following crude oil addition. Further work is required to fully understand the mechanism(s) of the observed reduction in N2O production. This study represents one of the first contributions to the understanding of the impact of crude oil pollution on denitrification and anammox, with profound implications for the management of aquatic ecosystems regarding eutrophication (N-removal)."}

The paper looks at the beliefs from the perspectives of doctors who are already in leadership roles themselves; to identify potential barriers they might have encountered and to arrive at better-informed strategies to engage more doctors in the leadership of the Australian health system. The research question is: \"What are the beliefs of medical leaders that form the key themes or dimensions of the negative perception of the 'dark side'?\". Design/methodology/approach The paper analysed data from two similar qualitative studies examining medical leadership and engagement in Australia by the same author, in collaboration with other researchers, which used in-depth semi-structured interviews with 45 purposively sampled senior medical leaders in leadership roles across Australia in health services, private and public hospitals, professional associations and health departments. The data were analysed using deductive and inductive approaches through a coding framework based on the interview data and literature review, with all sections of coded data grouped into themes. Findings Medical leaders had four key beliefs about the \"dark side\" as perceived through the eyes of their own past clinical experience and/or their clinical colleagues. These four beliefs or dimensions of the negative perception colloquially known as \"the dark side\" are the belief that they lack both managerial and clinical credibility, they have confused identities, they may be in conflict with clinicians, their clinical colleagues lack insight into the complexities of medical leadership and, as a result, doctors are actively discouraged from making the transition from clinical practice to medical leadership roles in the first place. Research limitations/implications This research was conducted within the Western developed-nation setting of Australia and only involved interviews with doctors in medical leadership roles. The findings are therefore limited to the doctors ' own perceptions of themselves based on their past experiences and beliefs. Future research involving doctors who have not chosen to transition to leadership roles, or other health practitioners in other settings, may provide a broader perspective. Also, this research was exploratory and descriptive in nature using qualitative methods, and quantitative research can be carried out in the future to extend this research for statistical generalisation.

The aim of this national population - based retrospective study was to compare the effectiveness of GEM - E to GEM alone for pancreatic cancer patients in real clinical practice. Patients with pancreatic cancer (ICD-10: C25) with prescription claims of gemcitabine or erlotinib between Jan 1, 2007 and Dec 31, 2012 were retrospectively identified from the Korean Health Insurance claims database. To be included in the study population, patients were required to have had a histological or cytological diagnosis within one year before chemotherapy. Patients treated with prior radiotherapy, surgery, or chemotherapy were excluded to reduce heterogeneity. Overall survival from the initiation of therapy and the medical costs of GEM - E and GEM were compared. A total of 4,267 patients were included in the analysis. Overall survival was not significantly longer in patients treated with GEM - E (median 6.77 months for GEM - E vs. 6.68 months for GEM, p = 0.0977). There was also no significant difference in the respective one-year survival rates (27.0 % vs. 27.3 %; p = 0.5988). Multivariate analysis using age, gender, and comorbidities as covariates did not reveal any significant differences in survival. Based on this relative effectiveness, the incremental cost per life year gained over GEM was estimated at USD 70,843.64 for GEM - E. GEM - E for pancreatic cancer is not more effective than GEM in a real - world setting, and it does not provide reasonable cost-effectiveness over GEM."}

The model was tested using a large array of both existing and newly designed compounds. Pulmonary absorption data was generated using the isolated perfused respiring rat lung (IPRLu) model for 82 drug discovery compounds and 17 marketed drugs. This dataset was used to build a novel QSAR model based on calculated physicochemical properties. A further 9 compounds were used to test the model's predictive capability. The QSAR model performed well on the 9 compounds in the \" Test set \" with a predicted versus observed correlation of R(2) = 0.85, and >65% of compounds correctly categorised. Calculated descriptors associated with permeability and hydrophobicity positively correlated with pulmonary absorption, whereas those associated with charge, ionisation and size negatively correlated. The novel QSAR model described here can replace routine generation of IPRLu model data for ranking and classifying compounds prior to synthesis. It will also provide scientists working in the field of inhaled drug discovery with a deeper understanding of the physicochemical drivers of pulmonary absorption based on a relevant respiratory compound dataset."}

It is particularly useful for assessing cosmetic ingredients that can no longer be tested using in vivo assays. To advance the use of this test especially for regulatory decision-making, we have established the RSMN assay in our laboratory according to Good Laboratory Practice and following the principles of the OECD test guideline 487 in vitro mammalian cell micronucleus test. Proficiency with the assay was established by correctly identifying direct-acting genotoxins and genotoxins requiring metabolism, as well as non-genotoxic / non-carcinogenic chemicals. We also report the analysis of our historical control data that demonstrate vehicle control and positive control values for % micronuclei in binucleated cells are in the ranges reported previously.

Specifically, Wnt-5a acts as a secreted growth factor that regulates dendritic spine formation in rodent hippocampal neurons, resulting in postsynaptic development that promotes the clustering of the postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95). Here, we focused on the early events occurring after the interaction between Wnt-5a and its Frizzled receptor at the neuronal cell surface. Additionally, we studied the role of heterotrimeric G proteins in Wnt-5a -dependent synaptic development. We report that Frizzled9 (FZD9), a Wnt receptor related to Williams' syndrome, is localized in the postsynaptic region, where it interacts with Wnt-5a. Functionally, FZD9 is required for the Wnt-5a -mediated increase in dendritic spine density. FZD9 forms a pre-coupled complex with G\u03b1o under basal conditions that dissociates after Wnt-5a stimulation. Accordingly, we found that G-protein inhibition abrogates Wnt-5a -dependent pathway in hippocampal neurons. In particular, the activation of G\u03b1o appears to be a key factor controlling the Wnt-5a - induced dendritic spine density. In addition, we found that G\u03b2\u03b3 is required for the Wnt-5a -mediated increase in cytosolic calcium levels and spinogenesis. Our findings reveal that FZD9 and heterotrimeric G proteins regulate Wnt-5a signaling and dendritic spines in cultured hippocampal neurons."}

It is a distinct clinicopathologic entity with complex molecular profile and poor prognosis. A 59 year old female presented with pyrexia of unknown origin since 1 month. On examination, there was severe pallor, hepatosplenomegaly and no palpable lymphadenopathy. Complete blood count revealed bicytopenia with normal total leucocyte count. Liver and renal function tests were normal. Ultrasonography abdomen revealed splenic enlargement with two focal lesions attributed to either splenic abscess or infarcts. Patient was being managed as splenic infarct but continued to have bicytopenia. Further investigation showed elevated serum ferritin, triglycerides and LDH. With a clinical suspicion of infection and haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis bone marrow aspiration (BMA) and biopsy (BMBx) was done. BMA showed extensive haemophagocytosis and ~7.4 % large lymphoma-like cells. On this basis PET-CT was suggested which showed enlarged spleen with diffuse uptake. BMBx showed nodular and intrasinusoidal collection of abnormal lymphoid cells. On immunohistochemistry, these cells were positive for CD20, CD5, MUM1, BCL-2, BCL-6 and negative for CD3, CD10 and CD23. CD34 highlighted focal intrasinusoidal pattern. The complete clinicopathological profile suggested the diagnosis of de novo CD5+ DLBCL, with primary hepatosplenic pattern of involvement. CD5+ DLBCL presenting as splenic infarct is very rare.

While the influence of individual health status changes and the future risk of new-onset hypertension is rarely understood, the present study applied this construct to assess the changes of cardiovascular health status and the morbidity of hypertension in Kailuan cohort study in north China. The Cardiovascular Health Score (CHS) was evaluated by the follow-ups of 2006-2007, 2008-2009, 2010-2011 and 2012-2013. The study population (n = 19381) was divided into 5 groups based on the changes in their CHS score between the first two follow-ups (\u25b3CHS) of 2006-2007 and 2008-2009 (\u2264-2, -1, 0, 1, \u22652). The morbidity of hypertension was collected during 2010-2011 and 2012-2013 follow-ups. Data analysis showed that during a median follow-up of 3.79\u00b10.96 years, morbidity of hypertension had a graded relationship with \u25b3CHS. As \u25b3CHS scored from low to high, the standardized morbidity of hypertension for all participants were 81.40, 75.47, 68.37, 71.43 and 83.13 per 1000 person-year, respectively. An increased \u25b3CHS score of 1 was associated with a 10% decrease in the future risk of new-onset hypertension (HR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.88-0.92). In conclusion, there was a strong inverse relationship between the incidence of new-onset hypertension and elevation of cardiovascular health metrics.

Rates of cigarette smoking, a leading contributor to CVD among PHAs, are 40-70% (2-3 times higher than the general population). Furthermore, PHAs have high rates of depression (40-60%), a risk factor for smoking cessation relapse. The current pilot study examined the effectiveness of a specifically tailored 5- session smoking cessation counselling programme for PHAs, which addressed depression, in combination with Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) in a cohort of PHA smokers (n = 50). At 6- month follow-up, 28% of participants demonstrated biochemically verified abstinence from smoking. This result compares favourably to other quit - smoking intervention studies, particularly given the high percentage of HIV+ smokers with depression. At study baseline, 52% of HIV+ smokers scored above the clinical cut-off for depression on the Centre for Epidemiological Studies - Depression (CES-D) scale. HIV+ smokers with depression at study baseline demonstrated quantitatively lower depression at 6- month follow-up with a large effect size (d = 1), though it did not reach statistical significance (p = .058). Furthermore, those with depression were no more likely to relapse than those without depression (p = .33), suggesting that our counselling programme adequately addressed this significant barrier to smoking cessation among PHAs. Our pilot study indicates the importance of tailored programmes to help PHAs quit smoking, the significance of addressing depressive symptoms, and the need for tailored counselling programmes to enhance quit rates among PHAs."}

Cyclical parthenogenesis (CP), in which organisms undergo several rounds of clonal reproduction followed by a sexual event, is one such life cycle. Many species, including crop pests (aphids), human parasites (trematodes) or models used in evolutionary science (Daphnia), are cyclical parthenogens. It is therefore crucial to understand the impact of such a life cycle on neutral genetic diversity. In this paper, we describe distributions of genetic diversity under conditions of CP with various clonal phase lengths. Using a Markov chain model of CP for a single locus and individual-based simulations for two loci, our analysis first demonstrates that strong departures from full sexuality are observed after only a few generations of clonality. The convergence towards predictions made under conditions of full clonality during the clonal phase depends on the balance between mutations and genetic drift. Second, the sexual event of CP usually resets the genetic diversity at a single locus towards predictions made under full sexuality. However, this single recombination event is insufficient to reshuffle gametic phases towards full-sexuality predictions. Finally, for similar levels of clonality, CP and acyclic partial clonality (wherein a fixed proportion of individuals are clonally produced within each generation) differentially affect the distribution of genetic diversity. Overall, this work provides solid predictions of neutral genetic diversity that may serve as a null model in detecting the action of common evolutionary or demographic processes in cyclical parthenogens (for example, selection or bottlenecks)."}

Recent studies have used Boolean network motifs to explore the link between form and function in gene regulatory networks and have found that the structure of a motif does not strongly determine its function, if this is defined in terms of the gene expression patterns the motif can produce. Here, we offer a different, higher - level definition of the ' function ' of a motif, in terms of two fundamental properties of its dynamical state space as a Boolean network. One is the basin entropy, which is a complexity measure of the dynamics of Boolean networks. The other is the diversity of cyclic attractor lengths that a given motif can produce. Using these two measures, we examine all 104 topologically distinct three-node motifs and show that the structural properties of a motif, such as the presence of feedback loops and feed-forward loops, predict fundamental characteristics of its dynamical state space, which in turn determine aspects of its functional versatility. We also show that these higher - level properties have a direct bearing on real regulatory networks, as both basin entropy and cycle length diversity show a close correspondence with the prevalence, in neural and genetic regulatory networks, of the 13 connected motifs without self-interactions that have been studied extensively in the literature."}

Here we report a role for the ubiquitin-specific protease 6 (USP6)/ TRE17 oncogene, which is overexpressed upon chromosome translocation in various human tumors, including aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC), and the related benign lesion nodular fasciitis. Ectopic expression of USP6 is known to drive formation of tumors, which recapitulate key features of ABC and nodular fasciitis; however, the identity of USP6's relevant substrates has been obscure. Here we report that the Jak1 - STAT3 signaling pathway serves as an essential effector of USP6 in BSTT formation. We found that USP6 directly deubiquitinated Jak1, leading to its stabilization and activation of STAT3. The tumorigenic potential of USP6 was attenuated significantly by CRISPR -mediated deletion of Jak1 or STAT3, or by administration of a Jak family inhibitor. Analysis of primary clinical samples of nodular fasciitis confirmed the activation of a Jak1 - STAT3 gene signature in vivo Together, our studies highlight Jak1 as the first identified substrate for USP6, and they offer a mechanistic rationale for the clinical investigation of Jak and STAT3 inhibitors as therapeutics for the treatment of bone and soft tissue tumors along with other neoplasms driven by USP6 overexpression.

The purpose of this study was to characterize the nature of patients co-managed by a pediatric hospitalist. The authors hypothesize that hospitalist co-management is safe and efficacious in pediatric orthopaedic surgical patients who are admitted to a community hospital. A retrospective review was performed of all pediatric orthopaedic surgical patients admitted to a community hospital who were co-managed by a pediatric hospitalist. Indications for hospitalization included pain control, antibiotic infusion, and need for neurovascular monitoring. Parameters of postoperative care and co-management were assessed, including presence of complications, medication introduction or adjustment by the hospitalist, follow-up adherence, and readmission / complication rates after discharge. Thirty-two patients were assessed with an average age of 8.8 years. Twenty-five percent of patients had an associated comorbidity, including asthma, attention deficit disorder, and/or autism. The pediatric hospitalist added pain medication to the original postoperative orders placed by the orthopaedics team in 44 percent of patients (14 of the 32) either for breakthrough pain or better long-term coverage. Additionally, 25 percent of patients had pain medication adjusted from the original dosing and schedule. The hospitalist team contacted the surgeon about the four patients (12.5 percent). In three of the cases, the surgeon was contacted to discuss pain medication, and one patient woke up agitated from anesthesia, necessitating a visit from the surgeon on the pediatrics floor. The length of stay was one day for all patients. The hospitalists rounded on and discharged patients the subsequent morning. All patients were given a follow-up appointment and schedule by the hospitalist team, and every patient followed up accordingly within ten days of discharge. No complications or hospital readmissions occurred within thirty days of discharge.

In this study, six FmEG derivatives with deletion of N-terminal fragments or fusion with an extra family 1 carbohydrate-binding module (CBM1) was constructed in order to evaluate the contribution of CBM1 to FmEG processivity and catalytic activity. FmEG showed a weak processivity and released cellobiose (G2) and cellotriose (G3) as main end products, and cellotriose (G4) as minor end product from filter paper (FP), but more amount of G4 was released from regenerated amorphous cellulose (RAC). All derivatives had similar activity on carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) with the same optimal pH (7.0) and temperature (50\u00b0C). However, fusing an extra CBM1 to FmEG\u25b324 or FmEG\u25b337 with flexible peptide significantly improved its processivity and catalytic activity to FP and RAC. Overall, 1.79- and 1.84-fold increases in the soluble /insoluble product ratio on FP, and 1.38- and 1.39-fold increases on RAC, compared to FmEG\u25b324, were recorded for CBM1 - FmEG\u25b324 and CBM1 -linker- FmEG\u25b324, respectively. Meanwhile, they displayed 2.64- and 2.67-fold more activity on RAC, and 1.68- and 1.77-fold on FP, respectively. Similar improvement was also obtained for CBM1 -linker- FmEG\u25b337 as compared with FmEG\u25b337.

A retrospective, single-center study was conducted in which patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy on a stable dose of immediate-release OXC for at least 4 weeks were switched overnight to ESL. Patients were switched because they experienced persistent seizures with OXC but were unable to tolerate increased OXC dosing due to adverse events. Tolerability was assessed using the Adverse Events Profile (AEP), quality of life was assessed using the Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory 10 (QOLIE-10), and alertness was assessed as reaction time using a subtest of the Test Battery for Attention Performance version 2.3.

Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) are responsible for adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing and exemplify the complex association between RNA editing and alternative splicing. The self-editing activity of ADAR2, which acts on its own pre-mRNA, leads to its alternative splicing. Alternative splicing occurs independently at nine splicing sites on ADAR2 pre-mRNA, generating numerous alternative splicing variants with various catalytic activities. A-to-I RNA editing is important in a range of physiological processes in humans and is associated with several diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, mood disorders, epilepsy and glioma. Reduced editing at the glutamine / arginine site of the AMPA receptor subunit GluA2 in glioma, without any alteration in ADAR2 expression, is a notable phenomenon. Several studies have tried to explain this alteration in the catalytic activity of ADAR2; however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The present review summarizes the relevant literature and shares experimental results concerning ADAR2 alternative splicing. In particular, the present review demonstrates that shifts in the relative abundance of the active and inactive splicing variants of ADAR2 may reduce the ADAR2 editing activity in glioma. Dominant expression of ADAR2 splicing variant with low enzyme activity causes reduced RNA editing of GluA2 subunit at the glutamine / arginine site in glioma."}

Porphyromonus gingivalis (P. gingivalis), a major periodontal pathogen, has already been shown to have a significant role in the inflammatory response of CAD in vivo. The aim of the present study was to identify whether P. gingivalis heat-shock protein 60 (HSP60) induced the dysfunction of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro. HUVECs were stimulated with a range of P. gingivalis HSP60 concentrations (1, 10 and 100 ng/l) at different time-points. The levels of vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and cysteinyl aspartate-specific protease-3 (caspase-3) were measured using western blot analysis. The apoptotic rate of HUVECs was detected using flow cytometry.

Oral E2 and ethinyl estradiol (EE) generated dose related uterine growth and important hepatic estrogenic effects. EP induced uterine growth at about hundred-fold lower doses. This was possible with almost absent effects on plasma cholesterol or angiotensinogen. Preliminary pharmacokinetic studies with EC508 used intravenous and oral administration in male rats. Resulting blood levels revealed complete oral bioavailability. Further high blood - but low plasma concentrations indicated erythrocyte binding of EC508 in vivo as potential mechanism of low extraction at liver passage. Very high systemic estrogenicity combined with markedly lower or absent adverse hepatic estrogenic effects is evidence for a systemic release of E2 from sulfonamide EP.

This paper provides an overview of contemporary tension-free IHR techniques and materials, and illustrates the expected postoperative imaging findings and iatrogenic injuries. Emphasis is placed on multidetector CT, which represents the ideal modality to comprehensively visualize the operated groin region and deeper intra-abdominal structures. CT consistently depicts seroma, mesh infections, hemorrhages, bowel complications and urinary bladder injuries, and thus generally provides a consistent basis for therapeutic choice. Since radiologists are increasingly requested to investigate suspected iatrogenic complications, this paper aims to provide an increased familiarity with early CT studies after IHR, including complications and normal postoperative appearances such as focal pseudolesions, in order to avoid misinterpretation and inappropriate management."}

The sporophytic secretory tapetum is required for the biosynthesis of sporopollenin. Although several enzymes involved in sporopollenin biosynthesis have been reported, the regulatory mechanism of these enzymes in tapetal layer remains elusive. ABORTED MICROSPORES (AMS) and MALE STERILE 188 / MYB103 / MYB80 (MS188 / MYB103 / MYB80) are two tapetal cell -specific transcription factors required for pollen wall formation. AMS functions upstream of MS188. Here we report that AMS and MS188 target the CYP703A2 gene, which is involved in sporopollenin biosynthesis. We found that AMS and MS188 were localized in tapetum while CYP703A2 was localized in both tapetum and locule. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) showed that MS188 directly bound to the promoter of CYP703A2 and luciferase-inducible assay showed that MS188 activated the expression of CYP703A2. Yeast two-hybrid and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) further demonstrated that MS188 complexed with AMS. The expression of CYP703A2 could be partially restored by the elevated levels of MS188 in the ams mutant. Therefore, our data reveal that MS188 coordinates with AMS to activate CYP703A2 in sporopollenin biosynthesis of plant tapetum."}

The specific cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying DNP remain elusive and its treatment are limited. We investigated roles of EphB1 receptor in the development of DNP. Diabetic neuropathic pain was produced in male, adult, Sprague-Dawley rats by a single i.p. streptozotocin (STZ) or alloxan. Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry were used to analyse expression of EphB1 receptor as well as the activation of the glial cells and the pro-inflammatory cytokines in the spinal cord. DNP manifested as mechanical allodynia, which was determined by measuring incidence of foot withdrawal in response to mechanical indentation of the hind paw by an electro von Frey filament. Diabetic neuropathic pain and high blood glucose were exhibited simultaneously in around 70% of animals that received i.p. STZ or alloxan. Phosphorylation of EphB1, activation of the astrocytes and microglial cells, and level of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 in the spinal cord were significantly increased in rats with DNP. Spinal blocking EphB1 receptor activation in the late phase after STZ injection significantly suppressed the established mechanical allodynia as well as activation of the astrocytes and microglial cells and activity of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2. However, spinal treatment of EphB1 - Fc in the early phase after STZ injection did not prevent the induction of DNP. EphB1 receptor activation in the spinal cord is critical to the maintenance, but not induction of diabetic pain. EphB1 receptor may be a potential target for relieving the established diabetic pain. Activation of EphB1 receptor in the spinal cord is critical to maintaining the established diabetic neuropathic pain, but not to diabetic pain induction. Spinal blocking EphB1 receptor activation suppresses ongoing diabetic neuropathic pain."}

M. milvus is endemic to the western Palearctic and has an estimated total population of 20-24,000 breeding pairs. The species was in decline until the 1970s due to persecution and has declined again since the 1990s due to ingestion of rodenticide-treated baits, illegal poisoning and changes in agricultural practices, particularly in its core range. Whereas F1 M. milvus \u00d7 M. migr. migrans hybrid offspring have been found, F2 and F3 hybrids have only rarely been reported, with low nesting success rates of F1 hybrids and partial hybrid sterility likely playing a role. Here, we analyzed the mitochondrial (CO1 and CytB) and nuclear (Myc) DNA loci of 184 M. milvus, 124 M. migr. migrans and 3 F1 hybrid individuals collected across central Europe. In agreement with previous studies, we found low heterozygosity in M. milvus regardless of locus. We found that populations of both examined species were characterized by a high gene flow within populations, with all of the major haplotypes distributed across the entire examined area. Few haplotypes displayed statistically significant aggregation in one region over another. We did not find mitochondrial DNA of one species in individuals with the plumage of the other species, except in F1 hybrids, which agrees with Haldane\u00b4s Rule. It remains to be investigated by genomic methods whether occasional gene flow occurs through the paternal line, as the examined Myc gene displayed only marginal divergence between M. milvus and M. migr. migrans. The central Europe an population of M. milvus is clearly subject to free intraspecific gene flow, which has direct implications when considering the origin of individuals in M. milvus re-introduction programs."}

GEnC were cultured under normal or high -glucose conditions in the presence or not of the GCN2 kinase activator, tryptophanol. Glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) expression was assessed by western blotting and reactive oxygen species (ROS) using a fluorogenic probe. Activities of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and protein kinase C (PKC) were assessed by commercial activity assays, sorbitol colorimetrically, methylglyoxal by ELISA and O-linked \u03b2-N-acetyl glucosamine (O-GlcNAc)-modified proteins by western blotting. High glucose induced GLUT1 expression, increased ROS and inhibited GAPDH. Also it increased the polyol pathway product sorbitol, PKC activity, the level of the O-GlcNAc-modified proteins that produced by the hexosamine pathway and the advanced glycation endproducts' precursor methylglyoxal. Co-treatment of GEnC with tryptophanol restored the above high-glucose - induced alterations. Activation of GCN2 kinase protects GEnC from high-glucose - induced harmful molecular pathways.

Results from a cohort of Danish men born in 1953 Exposure to psychosocial stress is associated with increased risk of a number of somatic and mental disorders with relation to immune system functioning. We aimed to explore whether stressful events in early and recent life was associated with leucocyte telomere length (TL), which is assumed to reflect the accumulated burden of inflammation and oxidative stress occurring during the life course. We specifically aimed to address whether childhood constitutes a sensitive period and how much of the relation between stressful life events and TL is mediated through somatic and mental health, lifestyle, and markers of low-grade inflammation. A cohort of Danish men born in 1953 has been followed since birth in the Metropolit Cohort. These men underwent a health examination including blood sampling in 2010 and a subset of 324 also had a quantitative PCR-based measurement of TL. The relation between stressful life events and TL was analysed using structural equation modelling, which also provided an estimate of the proportion of the total effect mediated by somatic and mental health (cardiovascular disease, body mass and depressive mood), lifestyle factors, and low grade inflammation (C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10). Total number of stressful events experienced during the life course was not associated with TL. In terms of sensitive periods, we found that number of stressful events in childhood was associated with shorter TL (\u03b2per number stressful events in childhood =-0.02(SE=-0.02); P=0.05). This relation was particularly strong for being placed away from home (\u03b2=-0.16; P<0.000). Thirty percent of the total effect of stressful events in childhood on TL was mediated by the included variables, with the largest proportion being mediated through depressive mood (16%) and CRP (9%). This study suggests that stressful events in childhood are associated with shorter TL in middle-aged men and that part of this relation is explained by depressive mood and low grade inflammation."}

Among these is tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, a proinflammatory cytokine known to play an important role in autoimmune disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Although AD and RA appear to involve similar pathological mechanisms through the production of TNF-\u03b1, the relationship between AD and RA remains unknown. To determine the relative risk of AD among RA patients and non- RA patients, and whether anti-TNF therapy for RA was associated with a lower risk of AD in RA patients. We performed a nested case-control study of more than 8.5 million commercially insured adults (aged \u226518 years) in all 50 US states, Puerto Rico, and US Virgin Islands in the Verisk Health claims database. We derived a sub-cohort of subjects with a diagnosis of RA (controls), or RA and AD (cases), matching cases and controls based on age, sex, exposure assessment period, and methotrexate treatment. We also assessed relative risk of AD following exposure to standard RA therapies, including anti-TNF agents (infliximab, adalimumab, etanercept), methotrexate, prednisone, sulfasalazine, and rituximab.

However, the mechanism for events after dimerization in breast cancer models is not clear. We found that expressions of alpha-smooth muscle actin (ACTA2) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) significantly increased with transient or stable overexpression of HER2 in EGFR - positive breast cancer cells. ACTA2 and STAT1 expression was also increased in HER2 - positive breast cancer patients. In contrast, ACTA2 expression was decreased by HER2 siRNA. Next, we investigated the co-relation between STAT1 and ACTA2 expression. Basal ACTA2 expression was significantly decreased by treatment with the STAT1 inhibitor fludarabine or the JAK2 inhibitor AG490. In contrast, ACTA2 expression was increased by STAT1 overexpression. Levels of ACTA2, STAT1, and HER2 were increased and relapse free survival was decreased in high-risk breast cancer patients. We also investigated the effect of ACTA2 on cell motility, which was suppressed by ACTA2 shRNA overexpression in MDA-MB231 HER2 and 4T1 mammary carcinoma cells. The number of lung metastatic nodules was significantly decreased in ACTA2 knockdown mice. Taken together, these results demonstrated that induction of ACTA2 by EGFR and HER2 dimerization was regulated through a JAK2 / STAT1 signaling pathway, and aberrant ACTA2 expression accelerated the invasiveness and metastasis of breast cancer cells."}

Since the annealing temperature of each station can be controlled independently, the device covers an annealing temperature range of 50-68 \u00b0C, which is wide enough to perform PCR for any DNA fragment regardless of its optimum annealing condition. This arrangement lets us continuously obtain an amplified amount of a DNA fragment at least from one of the stations. The device consists of four identical cylindrical stations (diameter 20 mm, height 55 mm). A polytetrafluoroethylene capillary reactor (length 2 m, I.D. 100 \u03bcm, O.D. 400 \u03bcm) is wound helically up around each station. The whole assembly is designed to minimize the number of heating blocks (for providing temperatures of denaturation, annealing, and extension) to be seven and to shape a compact cube (height 55 mm, base 60 mm \u00d7 60 mm). The reproducibility for continuous-flow PCR is reasonably high (run -to- run and station -to- station relative standard deviation of their amplification is lower than 6 % and about 4 %, respectively). Performance on the optimization - free DNA amplification has been evaluated with four DNA samples with different annealing conditions and product sizes (323, 608, 828, and 1101 bp), which has demonstrated that in all cases, PCR is successful at least on one station. In addition, three DNA fragment s with different lengths (323, 1101, and 2836 bp) have been successfully amplified in a segmented - flow mode without the carry-over contamination between segments. This result suggests that this device could serve as the PCR module of a continuous-flow high-throughput on-line total DNA analysis system integrating all necessary modules from cell lysis / DNA extraction to PCR product analysis."}

Little evidence is available on whether sex-differences occur in response to immunisation in infancy even though this is the age group in which most vaccines are administered. Factors other than sex, such as timing or coadministration of other vaccines, can also influence the immune response to vaccination. Individual participant data meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials of vaccines in healthy infants and young children will be conducted. Fully anonymised data from \u223c170 randomised controlled trials of v accines for diphtheria, tetanus, Bordetella pertussis, polio, Haemophilus influenzae type B, hepatitis B, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella and rotavirus will be combined for analysis. Outcomes include measures of immunogenicity (immunoglobulins), reactogenicity, safety and disease -specific clinical efficacy. Data from trials of vaccines containing similar components will be combined in hierarchical models and the effect of sex and timing of vaccinations estimated for each outcome separately. Systematic reviews of published estimates of sex-differences cannot adequately answer questions in this field since such comparisons are never the main purpose of a clinical trial, thus a large degree of reporting bias exists in the published literature. Recent improvements in the widespread availability of individual participant data from randomised controlled trials makes it feasible to conduct extensive individual participant data meta-analyses which were previously impossible, thereby reducing the effect of publication or reporting bias on the understanding of the infant immune response.

Undifferentiated PC12 cells were treated with HG (140 mM/ 24 h) in the presence and absence of Atorvastatin (1 \u03bcM/ 96 h). The cell viability was measured by MTT assay and the gene and protein expressions profile of NOX (1-4) were determined by RT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. Levels of ROS and malondialdehyde (MDA) were also evaluated. Gene and protein expression levels of NOX (1-4) and consequently ROS and MDA levels were elevated in HG - treated PC12 cells. Atorvastatin could significantly decrease HG - induced NOXs, ROS and MDA elevation and improve impaired cell viability. It can be concluded that HG could elevate NOXs activity, ROS and MDA levels in neural tissues and Atorvastatin as a small molecule NOX inhibitor drug may prevent and delay diabetic complications, particularly neuropathy."}

Microglia accumulation and activation within the brain has recently been shown to induce neuronal cell death after eSAH. In isolated mouse brain capillaries after eSAH, we show a significantly increased gene expression for intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and P-selectin. Hence, we hypothesized that extracerebral intravascular inflammatory processes might initiate the previously reported microglia accumulation within the brain tissue. We therefore induced eSAH in knockout mice for ICAM-1 (ICAM-1(-/-)) and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1(-/-)) to find a significant decrease in neutrophil - endothelial interaction within the first 7 days after the bleeding in a chronic cranial window model. This inhibition of neutrophil recruitment to the endothelium results in significantly ameliorated microglia accumulation and neuronal cell death in knockout animals in comparison to controls. Our results suggest an outside-in activation of the CNS innate immune system at the vessel / brain interface following eSAH. Microglia cells, as part of the brain's innate immune system, are triggered by an inflammatory reaction in the microvasculature after eSAH, thus contributing to neuronal cell death. This finding offers a whole range of new research targets, as well as possible therapy options for patients suffering from eSAH."}

Extracellular serotonin levels are regulated by the serotonin transporter (SERT) and organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3), and vHipp OCT3 expression is enhanced during 24 hours of amphetamine withdrawal, while SERT expression is unaltered. Here, we tested whether OCT3 and SERT expression in the CeA is also affected during acute withdrawal to explain opposing regional alterations in limbic serotonergic neurotransmission and if respective changes continued with two weeks of withdrawal. We also determined whether changes in transporter expression were confined to these regions. Male rats received amphetamine or saline for two weeks followed by 24 hours or two weeks of withdrawal, with transporter expression measured using Western immunoblot. OCT3 and SERT expression increased in the CeA at both withdrawal timepoints. In the vHipp, OCT3 expression increased only at 24 hours of withdrawal, with an equivalent pattern seen in the dorsomedial hypothalamus. No changes were evident in any other regions sampled. These regionally specific changes in limbic OCT3 and SERT expression may partially contribute to the serotonergic imbalance and negative affect during amphetamine withdrawal."}

This study examined the nutritional aspects of night eating, its related factors, and the association between night eating and body weight among Korean adolescents. This study analysed the data from a one day 24-hour dietary recall as well as a demographic survey of 1,738 Korean adolescents aged 12 to 18- years -old obtained from the 2010-2012 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. ' Night eating ' was defined as consuming 25% or more of one's daily energy intake between 21:00 and 06:00. Subjects complying with the preceding condition were classified as ' night eaters ', whereas the rest were considered ' non-night eaters '. Logistic regression analysis examined factors related to night eating. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to examine the relationship between night eating and BMI z-scores, whereas multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to examine the relationship between night eating and weight status. About 21% of Korean adolescents appeared to be night eaters. Night eaters showed increased breakfast skipping (P = 0.001), higher energy intake from snacks (P < 0.001), greater proportion of energy intake from fat (P = 0.029), and lower Dietary Diversity Scores (P = 0.008) than non-night eaters. Male adolescents presented 1.9 times higher odds of being night eaters than females. Adolescents whose both parents were night eaters were 4.4 times as likely to be night eaters as those whose neither parents were. Female adolescents showed a significant relationship between night eating and BMI z-scores (\u03b2 = 0.28, P = 0.004). However, night eating did not increase odds of being overweight or obese in adolescents. Night eating in Korean adolescents was related to undesirable dietary behaviours and low diet quality in general as well as higher BMI z-scores in females. Male gender and parental night eating appeared to be the factors that significantly increased odds of night eating. These results suggest that night eating should be considered when designing nutrition education or intervention programs targeting adolescents."}

Prospective, randomized, double-blind study conducted at eight pediatric emergency departments (EDs) in the US and Canada (NCT#01234883). The primary outcome measure was serum bicarbonate level at 4 h. Secondary outcomes included safety and tolerability. The hypothesis was that PLA would be superior to 0.9 % NaCl in improvement of 4-h bicarbonate. Patients (n = 100) aged \u22656 months to <11 years with AGE -induced moderate-to- severe dehydration were enrolled. Patients with a baseline bicarbonate level \u226422 mEq/L formed the modified intent to treat (mITT) group. At baseline, the treatment groups were comparable except that the PLA group was older. At hour 4, the PLA group had greater increases in serum bicarbonate from baseline than did the 0.9 % NaCl group (mean \u00b1 SD at 4 h: 18 \u00b1 3.74 vs 18.0 \u00b1 3.67; change from baseline of 1.6 and 0.0, respectively; P = .004). Both treatment groups received similar fluid volumes. The PLA group had less abdominal pain and better dehydration scores at hour 2 (both P = .03) but not at hour 4 (P = 0.15 and 0.08, respectively). No patient experienced clinically relevant worsening of laboratory findings or physical examination, and hospital admission rates were similar. One patient in each treatment group developed hyponatremia. Four patients developed hyperkalemia (PLA :1, 0.9 % NaCl :3). In comparison with 0.9 % NaCl, PLA for rehydration in children with AGE was well tolerated and led to more rapid improvement in serum bicarbonate and dehydration score. "}

Its fluid is acidic, and the calcium concentration is low and declines along the length of the epididymal tubule. However, our knowledge of ionic currents and mechanisms of calcium homeostasis in rat epididymal epithelial cells remains enigmatic. In this study, to better understand calcium regulation in the epididymis, we use the patch-clamp method to record from single rat cauda epididymal principal cells. We detect a constitutively active Ca(2+) current with characteristics that match the epithelial calcium channel TRPV6. Electrophysiological and pharmacological data also reveal a constitutively active calcium-activated chloride conductance (CaCC). Removal of extracellular calcium attenuates not only the TRPV6 -like conductance, but also the CaCC. Lanthanide block is time dependent such that the TRPV6 -like component is inhibited first, followed by the CaCC. The putative CaCC blocker niflumic acid partially inhibits whole-cell currents, whereas La(3+) almost abolishes whole-cell currents in principal cells. Membrane potential measurements reveal an interplay between La(3+) - sensitive ion channels and those that are sensitive to the specific TMEM16A inhibitor tannic acid. In vivo perfusion of the cauda epididymal tubule shows a substantial rate of Ca(2+) reabsorption from the luminal side, which is dose-dependently suppressed by ruthenium red, a putative blocker of epithelial Ca(2+) channels and CaCC. Finally, we discover messenger RNA for both TRPV6 and TMEM16A in the rat epididymis and show that their proteins colocalize in the apical membrane of principal cells. Collectively, these data provide evidence for a coupling mechanism between TRPV6 and TMEM16A in principal cells that may play an important role in the regulation of calcium homeostasis in the epididymis."}

However, in case of large surgical defects caused by the enucleation, spontaneous regeneration of bone is a rare phenomenon and it depends on factors, such as age of the patient, intact periosteum, and proper stabilization. The study included 16 patients, who reported to the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery with the complaint of pain and swelling in the jaws diagnosed as cyst. The sample included equal numbers of male and female subjects aged between 15 and 40 years. Panoramic radiographs were taken pre- and postoperatively on day 2 of the enucleation. The dimensions of the cyst were evaluated on the radiograph according to the proforma. Subsequent radiographs were taken at regular intervals of 1.5, 3, and 6 months using standard parameters and were analyzed using MCID\u2122 analysis software of imaging research. Mean reduction was seen in up to 39 and 60% in the cystic cavity size and increase in the mean density up to 59 and 90.2% at 3 and 6 months intervals respectively. Spontaneous bone regeneration was seen even after primary closure of the large cystic defect without the need for placement of foreign substances or grafts and it also eliminated the complications resulting from placement of foreign substance. Further studies are required in a larger sample with longer follow-up durations to confirm the outcome of the present work for the benefit of patients. The present study depicted that spontaneous bone regeneration can occur with accepted results after simple enucleation of jaw cyst without the aid of any graft material. Hence, simple enucleation may be considered as a first line of treatment modality for cystic lesion of the jaws. This simplifies the surgical procedure, decreases the economic and biologic costs, and reduces the risk of postoperative complications. Follow-up is necessary along with patient's compliance for the success of treatment."}

A critical step in the preparation of membrane proteins after expression in any system is the solubilization of the protein in aqueous solution, typically using detergents and lipids, to obtain the protein in a form suitable for purification, structural or functional analysis. This process is particularly difficult as the objective is to prepare the protein in an unnatural environment, a protein detergent complex, separating it from its natural lipid partners while causing the minimum destabilization or modification of the structure. Although the process is difficult, and relatively hard to master, an increasing number of membrane proteins have been successfully isolated after expression in a wide variety of systems. In this chapter we give a general protocol for preparing protein detergent complexes that is aimed at guiding the reader through the different critical steps. In the second part of the chapter we illustrate how to analyze the composition of protein detergent complexes; this analysis is important as it has been found that compositional variation often causes irreproducible results."}

An Exploration of the ICWR-1 Model of Individual Psychological Resilience The nature of nursing work is demanding and can be stressful. Previous studies have shown a high rate of burnout among employed nurses. Recently, efforts have been made to understand the role of resilience in determining the psychological adjustment of employed nurses. A theoretical model of resilience was proposed recently that includes several constructs identified in the literature related to resilience and to psychological functioning. As nursing students are the future of the nursing workforce it is important to advance our understanding of the determinants of resilience in this population. Student nurses who had completed their final practicum were invited to participate in an online survey measuring the key constructs of the ICWR-1 model. 422 students from across Australia and Canada completed the survey between July 2014 and July 2015. As well as several key demographics, trait negative affect, mindfulness, self-efficacy, coping, resilience, and burnout were measured. We used structural equation modeling and found support for the major pathways of the model; namely that resilience had a significant influence on the relationship between mindfulness, self-efficacy and coping, and psychological adjustment (burnout scores). Furthermore, as predicted, Neuroticism moderated the relationship between coping and burnout. Results are discussed in terms of potential approaches to supporting nursing students who may be at risk of burnout."}

The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of direct screw repair by using minimally invasive surgery for the lumbar pars interarticulars defects in a pilot study. Direct repair of pars interarticulars defects has been used to treat young adult patients. Reports concerning direct repair by minimally invasive techniques for pars interarticulars defects are quite rare. Review of medical records identified eight consecutive patients treated with intraoperative O-arm based navigation and microendoscopic techniques. Debridement and autograft of pars interarticularis defects was performed under microendoscopic procedure. Then, percutaneous bilateral intralaminar screws were inserted by utilizing intraoperative navigation. The clinical and radiological data were collected and analyzed retrospectively. Eight patients had a mean age of 28.4 years, and five were 30 years or younger at the time of treatment. Symptoms included axial back pain in 100% of patients without concomitant radiculopathy. Autograft was used in all cases. The average follow-up duration was 27.4 months with a range of 20 to 33 months. Symptoms resolved completely or partially in all patients. Low back pain visual analog scores decrease from preoperative 6.8 to postoperative 1.4 of eight cases. Of 16 pars defects, healing was observed in 13 (81.3%) at last radiological follow-up. One patient with bilateral fusion failure refused revision surgery because of mild complaint. No complications such as dural tear, nerve root injury, and infection occurred. Minimally invasive direct repair of the pars interarticularis defects with intralaminar screws by using microendoscopic system and navigation procedure can provide safe and effective treatment of spondylolysis with satisfactory clinical and radiological outcomes, which need some special tools with steep learning curve. 4."}

A systematic review of the available medical literature from 1980 to 2015 was conducted, and combined with consensus expert opinion from a recent survey of spine surgeons who treat metastatic spine tumors. There is very little evidence in the literature to provide guidance on the use of bone graft in metastatic tumor reconstruction. There is little evidence in the literature to support the preferential use of one graft type over the other. Approximately, 41% of respondents said they used bone graft or bone graft substitutes to accomplish fusion. There were 17 studies that described the use of a prefabricated prosthetic, 10 studies describing the use of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) bone cement, and only three studies describing the use of bone graft for anterior column reconstruction. The use of structural allograft was most popular among the experts for anterior reconstruction, followed by cage reconstruction, and PMMA bone cement. Achieving bony union may be of importance for the maintenance of spinal stability in the long term after reconstruction. Whether bony union is required for patients with shorter life expectancies is debatable.

FMD affects livestock, such as cattle, sheep, goats and pigs, and causes enormous economic losses due to reduced productivity and trade restrictions. Preparedness and early diagnosis are essential for effective control of FMD. Many diagnostic assays are dependent on raising high-affinity, anti-FMD virus (FMDV) serotype-specific antibodies in small animals (rabbits and guinea pigs) that give broad virus coverage. Here we show that soluble, truncated forms of bovine \u03b1v\u03b26 bind FMDV in an authentic RGD and divalent cation dependent interaction and can be used as the trapping reagent in a FMDV sandwich ELISA. In addition, inclusion of FLAG or His tags facilitates simple purification without the loss of virus binding. We also provide evidence that when combined with a guinea pig polyclonal serum, or serotype-specific monoclonal antibodies, the integrin can be used to detect viruses representative of all FMDV serotypes. We also show that recombinant FMDV empty capsids, with stabilising disulphide bonds, can serve as an antigen in the ELISA and can therefore replace inactivated virus antigen as a positive control for the assay.

Based on findings in rodents, we predicted that heavy current alcohol use and elevated stress and depression scores would be associated with deficits on high interference memory tasks, while early onset, prolonged binge patterns would lead to broader cognitive deficits on tests of associative encoding and executive functions. We developed the Concentration Memory Task, a novel computerized version of the Concentration card game with a high degree of interference. We found that young adults with elevated stress, depression, and alcohol consumption scores were impaired in the Concentration Memory Task. We also analyzed data from a previous study, and found that higher alcohol consumption scores were associated with impaired performance on another high interference memory task, based on Kirwan and Stark's Mnemonic Similarity Test. On the other hand, adolescent onset of binge drinking predicted poorer performance on broader range of memory tests, including a more systematic test of spatial recognition memory, and an associative learning task. Our results are broadly consistent with findings in rodents that acute alcohol and stress exposure suppress neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus, which in turn impairs performance in high interference memory tasks, while adolescent onset binge drinking causes more extensive brain damage and cognitive deficits."}

There are three kindlins in mammals, which share high sequence identity. Kindlin-1 is expressed primarily in epithelial cells, kindlin-2 is widely distributed and is particularly abundant in adherent cells, and kindlin-3 is expressed primarily in hematopoietic cells. These distributions are not exclusive; some cells express multiple kindlins, and transformed cells often exhibit aberrant expression, both in the isoforms and the levels of kindlins. Great interest in the kindlins has emerged from the recognition that they play major roles in controlling integrin function. In vitro studies, in vivo studies of mice deficient in kindlins, and studies of patients with genetic deficiencies of kindlins have clearly established that they regulate the capacity of integrins to mediate their functions. Kindlins are adaptor proteins; their function emanate from their interaction with binding partners, including the cytoplasmic tails of integrins and components of the actin cytoskeleton. The purpose of this review is to provide a brief overview of kindlin structure and function, a consideration of their binding partners, and then to focus on the relationship of each kindlin family member with cancer. In view of many correlations of kindlin expression levels and neoplasia and the known association of integrins with tumor progression and metastasis, we consider whether regulation of kindlins or their function would be attractive targets for treatment of cancer."}

However, there is little remaining in-depth expertise in this method because fibrinolysis is presently only rarely indicated. In a rural area in southwestern Germany, where an emergency primary percutaneous coronary intervention was not routinely available within 90-120 min, 156 STEMI patients underwent fibrinolysis with the plasminogen activator reteplase, performed by trained emergency physicians. The practicality of the treatment, as well as complications and the mortality of the patients in the preclinical phase until arrival at the hospital, were retrospectively studied. The mean time from onset of the symptoms to first medical contact was 114 \u00b1 116 min. The mean interval to the start of fibrinolysis of 13.5 \u00b1 6.4 min was within the 30 min mandated by the ESC. Patients with inferior STEMI represented the largest subgroup. Occurring in 39 cases (25 %), complications due to infarction were relatively common during the prehospital phase, including 15 cases (9.6 %) of cardiogenic shock, but in all cases the complications were manageable. No patient died before arrival at the hospital. As lysis - associated adverse effects, merely two uncomplicated mucosal haemorrhages and one case of mild allergic skin reactions were seen. In emergency situations with long transportation times to the nearest suitable cardiac catheterisation laboratory, preclinical fibrinolysis in STEMI still represents a workable method.

Effective feedback can become part of the learning cycle that is not only a learning opportunity for the student but can also be used to inform the teacher and ongoing curriculum development. Feedback is considered particularly important during the first year of university and can even be viewed as a retention strategy that can help attenuate student performance anxieties and solidify perceptions of academic support. Unfortunately, the provision of individualized, timely feedback can be particularly challenging in first-year courses as they tend to be large and diverse cohort classes that pose challenges of time and logistics. Various forms of generic feedback can provide rapid and cost-effect feedback to large cohorts but may be of limited benefit to students other than signaling weaknesses in knowledge. The present study describes a method that was used to provide formative task-related feedback to a large cohort of first-year physiology and anatomy students. Based on student evaluations presented in this study, this method provided feedback in a manner that engaged students, uncovered underlying misconceptions, facilitated peer discussion, and provided opportunity for new instruction while allowing the lecturer to recognize common gaps in knowledge and inform ongoing curriculum development."}

Here we demonstrate that SIRT2 binds, deacetylates, and inhibits the peroxidase activity of the antioxidant protein peroxiredoxin (Prdx-1) in breast cancer cells. Ectopic overexpression of SIRT2, but not its catalytically dead mutant, increased intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by hydrogen peroxide, which led to increased levels of an overoxidized and multimeric form of Prdx-1 with activity as a molecular chaperone. Elevated levels of SIRT2 sensitized breast cancer cells to intracellular DNA damage and cell death induced by oxidative stress, as associated with increased levels of nuclear FOXO3A and the proapoptotic BIM protein. In addition, elevated levels of SIRT2 sensitized breast cancer cells to arsenic trioxide, an approved therapeutic agent, along with other intracellular ROS - inducing agents. Conversely, antisense RNA - mediated attenuation of SIRT2 reversed ROS - induced toxicity as demonstrated in a zebrafish embryo model system. Collectively, our findings suggest that the tumor suppressor activity of SIRT2 requires its ability to restrict the antioxidant activity of Prdx-1, thereby sensitizing breast cancer cells to ROS - induced DNA damage and cell cytotoxicity.

Experts measure hyperemia using levels in a grading scale, a procedure that is subjective, non-repeatable and time consuming, thus creating a need for its automatisation. However, the task is far from straightforward due to data issues such as class imbalance or correlated features. In this paper, we study the specific features of hyperemia and propose various approaches to address these problems in the context of an automatic framework for hyperemia grading. Oversampling, undersampling and SMOTE approaches were applied in order to tackle the problem of class imbalance. 25 features were computed for each image and regression methods were then used to transform them into a value on the grading scale. The values and relationships among features and experts' values were analysed, and five feature selection techniques were subsequently studied. The lowest mean square error (MSE) for the regression systems trained with individual features is below 0.1 for both scales. Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) obtains the best values, but is less consistent than the random forest (RF) method. When all features are combined, the best results for both scales are achieved with MLP. Correlation based feature selection (CFS) and M5 provide the best results, MSE =0.108 and MSE =0.061 respectively. Finally, the class imbalance problem is minimised with the SMOTE approach for both scales (MSE <0.006). Machine learning methods are able to perform an objective assessment of hyperemia grading, removing both intra- and inter-expert subjectivity while providing a gain in computation time. SMOTE and oversampling approaches minimise the class imbalance problem, while feature selection reduces the number of features from 25 to 3-5 without worsening the MSE. As the differences between the system and a human expert are similar to the differences between experts, we can therefore conclude that the system behaves like an expert."}

Questionnaire -based cross-sectional study. Brittany, a French county. Adults with cerebral palsy. Questionnaires relating to drugs, orthotic devices, mobility aids, rehabilitation and medical input were sent to 435 members of a unique regional French network dedicated to adults with cerebral palsy. The questionnaire was completed by the participant or a helper if necessary. Of the 282 responders, 7.8% had a GMFCS level of I, 14.2% II, 17.7% III, 29.1% IV and 31.2% V. Participants consumed a large amount of healthcare. Almost three-quarters took orally administered drugs, of which antispastic and antiepileptic drugs were among the most frequent. Nearly all patients had at least one type of rehabilitation, 87.2% had physiotherapy, 78% used at least one mobility aid and 69.5% used at least one orthotic device. The frequency of numerous inputs increased with GMFCS level. Specificities were found for each GMFCS level, e.g. participants with GMFCS level IV and V had a high level of medical input and a greater use of trunk-supporting devices, antireflux and laxative. Profiles could be established based on GMFCS levels. Adults with cerebral palsy use a large amount of drugs, mobility aids, orthotic devices, rehabilitation and medical input. Healthcare is targeted at cerebral palsy -related issues. GMFCS is a determinant of healthcare consumption and thus a useful tool for clinical practice to target care appropriately."}

The species is poorly characterized at the genomic level that limits the understanding of functions at the molecular and genetics level. In the present study, we performed de novo transcriptome sequencing to produce a comprehensive transcript dataset of visceral mass tissue of K. kurodana by the Illumina paired-end sequencing technology. Over 234 million quality reads were assembled to a total of 315,924 contigs and 191,071 unigenes, with an average and N50 length of 585.6 and 715 bp and 678 and 927 bp, respectively. Overall, 36.32 % of the unigenes found matches to known protein / nucleotide sequences in the public databases. The direction of the unigenes to functional categories was determined using COG, GO, KEGG, and InterProScan protein domain search. The GO analysis search resulted in 22,967 unigenes (12.02 %) being categorized into 40 functional groups. The KEGG annotation revealed that metabolism pathway genes were enriched. The most prominent protein motifs include the zinc finger, ribonuclease H, reverse transcriptase, and ankyrin repeat domains. The simple sequence repeats (SSRs) identified from >1 kb length of unigenes show a dominancy of dinucleotide repeat motifs followed with tri- and tetranucleotide motifs. A number of unigenes were putatively assessed to belong to adaptation and defense mechanisms including heat shock proteins 70, Toll-like receptor 4, AMP-activated protein kinase, aquaporin-2, etc. Our data provide a rich source for the identification and functional characterization of new genes and candidate polymorphic SSR markers in K. kurodana.

Considering that in vitro assays may have limited metabolic capacity, inactive chemicals that are biotransformed into metabolites with endocrine bioactivity may be missed for further screening and testing. Therefore, there is a value in developing novel approaches to account for metabolism and endocrine activity of both parent chemicals and their associated metabolites. We used commercially available software to predict metabolites of 50 parent compounds, out of which 38 chemicals are known to have estrogenic metabolites, and 12 compounds and their metabolites are negative for estrogenic activity. Three ER QSAR models were used to determine potential estrogen bioactivity of the parent compounds and predicted metabolites, the outputs of the models were averaged, and the chemicals were then ranked based on the total estrogenicity of the parent chemical and metabolites. The metabolite prediction software correctly identified known estrogenic metabolites for 26 out of 27 parent chemicals with associated metabolite data, and 39 out of 46 estrogenic metabolites were predicted as potential biotransformation products derived from the parent chemical. The QSAR models estimated stronger estrogenic activity for the majority of the known estrogenic metabolites compared to their parent chemicals. Finally, the three models identified a similar set of parent compounds as top ranked chemicals based on the estrogenicity of putative metabolites. This proposed in silico approach is an inexpensive and rapid strategy for the detection of chemicals with estrogenic metabolites and may reduce potential false negative results from in vitro assays."}

Thai women have been reported to have a low rate of cervical cancer screening (27.7% of the 80% goal of WHO). We therefore aimed to apply the social marketing theory and health belief model in promoting cervical cancer screening in Kanthararom District, Sisaket Province. A total of 92 from 974 targeted women aged 3060 years were randomly divided into two groups. The experimental group underwent application of social marketing theory and a health belief model program promoting cervical cancer screening while the control group received normal services. Two research tools were used: (1) application of social marketing theory and health belief model program and (2) questionnaire used to evaluate perceptions of cervical cancer. Descriptive and inferential statistics including paired sample ttest and independent ttest were used to analyze the data. After the program had been used, the mean score of perception of cervical cancer of experimental group was at a higher level (x=4.09; S.D. =0.30), than in the control group (x=3.82; S.D. =0.20) with statistical significance (p<0.001). This research demonstrated an appropriate communication process in behavioral modification to prevent cervical cancer. It can be recommended that this program featuring social marketing and the health belief model be used to promote cervical cancer screening in targeted women and it can be promoted as a guideline for other health services, especially in health promotion and disease prevention."}

Recent reports showed that high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was better at identifying intimal flaps as compared with routine MRI techniques used in clinical settings. However, no current standardized sequence for high-resolution MRI without gadolinium enhancement produces images of satisfactory quality with clinically tolerable scanning times. This study evaluated a nonenhanced high-resolution fast spin echo (HR-FSE) MRI sequence for visualizing intimal flaps in patients with ICAD. Three patients with ICAD underwent plain MRI examination using a 2-dimensional T2-weighted FSE imaging sequence optimized for our 3T system (in-plane pixel size, .23 mm \u00d7 .23 mm; slice thickness 3 mm with no interslice gap), as well as scanning with conventional modalities, including CT angiography, magnetic resonance angiography, and digital subtraction angiography. We assessed whether these imaging methods could visualize an intimal flap and/or double lumen sign in the participants and compared the results between HR-FSE and the other modalities. HR-FSE images clearly showed intimal flaps and double lumen signs in all 3 patients, whereas the conventional modalities identified a double lumen sign in only 2 of the 3 patients. The present method of optimized HR-FSE imaging with a 3T system improved visualization of intimal flaps and should thus be considered for assessing patients with suspected ICAD that cannot be definitively diagnosed by conventional imaging modalities."}
{"document_id": "27511456_1", "text": "Quantification of intact plasma AGT consisting of oxidized and reduced conformations using a modified ELISA The pleiotropic actions of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) depend on the availability of angiotensinogen (AGT) which generates angiotensin I (ANG I) when cleaved by renin. Thus, quantification of the intact AGT (iAGT) concentrations is important to evaluate the actual renin substrate available. The iAGT conformation exists as oxidized AGT (oxi-AGT) and reduced AGT (red-AGT) in a disulfide bond, and oxi-AGT has a higher affinity for renin, which may exacerbate RAS - associated diseases. Accordingly, we determined iAGT, oxi-AGT, and red-AGT levels in plasma from rats and mice. Blood samples were obtained by cardiac puncture and then immediately mixed with an inhibitor solution containing a renin inhibitor. Total AGT (tAGT) levels were measured by tAGT ELISA which detects both cleaved and iAGT. iAGT levels were determined by iAGT ELISA which was found to only detect red-AGT. Thus, it was necessary to treat samples with dithiothreitol, a reducing agent, to quantify total iAGT concentration. tAGT levels in rat and mouse plasma were 1,839 \u00b1 139 and 1,082 \u00b1 77 ng/ml, respectively. iAGT levels were 53% of tAGT in rat plasma but only 22% in mouse plasma, probably reflecting the greater plasma renin activity in mice. The ratios of oxi-AGT and red-AGT were \u223c4:1 (rat) and 16:1 (mouse). Plasma iAGT consists of oxi-AGT and red-AGT, suggesting that oxidative stress can influence ANG I generation by the AGT conformation switch. Furthermore, the lower availability of plasma iAGT in mice suggests that it may serve as a limiting factor in ANG I formation in this species."}

Studies are ongoing to determine ways to further improve the therapeutic potential of mesenchymal stromal cells. A gas molecule that improves outcome in experimental sepsis is carbon monoxide. We hypothesized that preconditioning of mesenchymal stromal cells with carbon monoxide ex vivo would promote further therapeutic benefit when cells are administered in vivo after the onset of polymicrobial sepsis in mice. Animal study and primary cell culture. Laboratory investigation. BALB/c mice. Polymicrobial sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture. Mesenchymal stromal cells, mesenchymal stromal cells - conditioned with carbon monoxide, fibroblasts, or fibroblasts - conditioned with carbon monoxide were delivered by tail vein injections to septic mice. The mice were assessed for survival, bacterial clearance, and the inflammatory response during sepsis in each of the groups. Mesenchymal stromal cells were also assessed for their ability to promote bacterial phagocytosis by neutrophils, the production of specialized proresolving lipid mediators, and their importance for mesenchymal stromal cells function using gene silencing. Ex vivo preconditioning with carbon monoxide allowed mesenchymal stromal cells to be administered later after the onset of sepsis (6 hr), and yet maintain their therapeutic effect with increased survival. Carbon monoxide preconditioned mesenchymal stromal cells were also able to alleviate organ injury, improve bacterial clearance, and promote the resolution of inflammation. Mesenchymal stromal cells exposed to carbon monoxide, with docosahexaenoic acid substrate, produced specialized proresolving lipid mediators, particularly D-series resolvins, which promoted survival.

User satisfaction with primary and secondary care services was explored using data from annual Life Satisfaction Surveys. Trends in preferred first point of contact (primary vs secondary, public vs. private), reason for choice and health services issues, were described and stratified by patient characteristics, provider type, and rural/urban settings .Between 2002 and 2013, the average number of PHC consultations increased from 1.75 to 2.83 per person per year. In multivariate models, family medicine introduction was associated with an increase of 0.37 PHC consultations per person (P < 0.001), and slower annual growth in PHC and secondary care consultations. Following family medicine introduction, the growth of PHC and secondary care consultations per person was 0.08 and 0.30, respectively, a year.

The discovery that dystrophin mRNA is subject to translational suppression by the microRNA miR31, and that miR31 is elevated in the muscle of DMD patients, raises the possibility that the same oligonucleotide chemistries employed for exon skipping could be directed toward relieving this translational block. This approach would act synergistically with exon skipping where possible, but by targeting the 3'UTR it would further be of benefit to the many DMD patients who express low levels of in-frame transcript. We here present investigations into the feasibility of combining exon skipping with several different strategies for miR31 - modulation, using both in vitro models and the mdx mouse (the classical animal model of DMD), and monitoring effects on dystrophin at the transcriptional and translational level. We show that despite promising results from our cell culture model, our in vivo data failed to demonstrate similarly reproducible enhancement of dystrophin translation, suggesting that miR31 - modulation may not be practical under current oligonucleotide approaches. Possible explanations for this disappointing outcome are discussed, along with suggestions for future investigations."}

Although ProDH1 has been studied extensively, especially under abiotic stress, ProDH2 has only started to be analysed in recent years. These genes display distinctive expression patterns and show weak transcriptional co-regulation, but are both activated in pathogen - infected tissues. We have demonstrated previously that Arabidopsis plants with silenced ProDH1 / 2 expression fail to trigger defences against the hemibiotrophic bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato AvrRpm1 (Pst-AvrRpm1), and that ProDH1 and ProDH2 are differentially regulated by salicylic acid (SA). In the current work, we used prodh1 and prodh2 single- mutant plants to assess the particular contribution of each gene to resistance against Pst-AvrRpm1 and the necrotrophic fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea. In addition, we studied the sensitivity of ProDH1 and ProDH2 to the jasmonic acid (JA) defence pathway. We found that ProDH1 and ProDH2 are both necessary to achieve maximum resistance against Pst-AvrRpm1 and B. cinerea. However, ProDH2 has a major effect on early restriction of B. cinerea growth. Interestingly, ProDH1 is up-regulated by SA and JA, whereas ProDH2 is only activated by JA, and both genes display transcriptional inter-regulation at basal and infection conditions. These studies provide the first evidence of the contribution of ProDH2 to disease resistance, and describe the differential regulation and non-redundant but complementary function of both enzyme isoforms in infected tissues, providing support for a fundamental role of ProDH in the control of biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens."}

Protein repetitiveness of positive and negative datasets can affect the prediction result: high protein repetitiveness of positive or negative datasets yield high performance prediction result.

Against this background, we demonstrate how the natural correlation between numerosities and continuous magnitudes makes it nearly impossible to study non-symbolic numerosity processing in isolation from continuous magnitudes, and therefore the results of behavioral and imaging studies with infants, adults and animals can be explained, at least in part, by relying on continuous magnitudes. In the second part, we explain the ' sense of magnitude ' theory and review studies that directly demonstrate that continuous magnitudes are more automatic and basic than numerosities. Finally, we present outstanding questions. Our conclusion is that there is not enough convincing evidence to support the number sense theory anymore. Therefore, we encourage researchers not to assume that number sense is simply innate, but to put this hypothesis to the test, and to consider if such an assumption is even testable in light of the correlation of numerosity and continuous magnitudes."}

Therefore, there is a tremendous need to improve the nutritional value of cotton embryos. In this study, a conventional management (CM) and two integrated cotton management strategies (IMS1, IMS2) were performed at two soil fertility levels to study the relationships among soil N, N assimilation, embryonic protein accumulation and protein quality. The levels of proteins, essential amino acids, and semi-essential amino acids, especially those of glutamate, lysine, and methionine, were higher in IMS1 and IMS2 embryos than in CM embryos. These changes were significantly positively correlated with the soil - available N content, glutamine synthetase activity and peak value of protein accumulation rate and were negatively correlated with the free amino acid level. These results illustrated that integrated management strategies, especially the rates and timing of N application, raise the level of soil available N, which is beneficial for N assimilation in developing cotton embryos. The protein content was limited by the rate of protein accumulation rather than by the free amino acid content. The combination of target yield fertilization, a growth -driven N application schedule, a high plant density and the seedling raising with bio-organic fertilizer can substantially improve protein quality in cotton embryos, especially at a soil with low soil organic matter and total nitrogen."}

Twelve Ti-Nb-Zr-Ta-Si alloy implants were fabricated and placed into the right femur sites in six rabbits, and commercially pure titanium implants were used as controls in the left femur. Tetracycline and alizarin red were administered 3 weeks and 1 week before euthanization, respectively. At 4 weeks and 8 weeks after implantation, animals were euthanized, respectively. Surface characterization and implant-bone contact surface analysis were performed by using a scanning electron microscope and an energy dispersive X-ray detector. Mineral apposition rate was evaluated using a confocal laser scanning microscope. Toluidine blue staining was performed on undecalcified sections for histology and histomorphology evaluation. Scanning electron microscope and histomorphology observation revealed a direct contact between implants and bone of all groups. After a healing period of 4 weeks, Ti-Nb-Zr-Ta-Si alloy implants showed significantly higher mineral apposition rate compared to commercially pure titanium implants (P < 0.05), whereas there was no significant difference between Ti-Nb-Zr-Ta-Si alloy implants and commercially pure titanium implants (P > 0.05) at 8 weeks. No significant difference of bone-to-implant contact was observed between Ti-Nb-Zr-Ta-Si alloy implants and commercially pure titanium implants implants after a healing period of 4 weeks and 8 weeks. This study showed that Ti-Nb-Zr-Ta-Si alloy implants could establish a close direct contact comparedto commercially pure titanium implants implants, improved mineral matrix apposition rate, and may someday be an alternative as a material for dental implants."}

Tailored acquisitions can be designed to detect, for example, the inhibitory neurotransmitter \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA), or the reduction-oxidation (redox) compound glutathione (GSH), and single - voxel edited experiments are generally acquired at a rate of one metabolite - per-experiment. We demonstrate that simultaneous detection of the overlapping signals of GABA and GSH is possible using Hadamard Encoding and Reconstruction of Mega-Edited Spectroscopy (HERMES). HERMES applies orthogonal editing encoding (following a Hadamard scheme), such that GSH- and GABA - edited difference spectra can be reconstructed from a single multiplexed experiment. At a TE of 80ms, 20-ms editing pulses are applied at 4.56ppm (on GSH),1.9ppm (on GABA), both offsets (using a dual-lobe cosine-modulated pulse) or neither. Hadamard combinations of the four sub-experiments yield GABA and GSH difference spectra. It is shown that HERMES gives excellent separation of the edited GABA and GSH signals in phantoms, and resulting edited lineshapes agree well with separate Mescher-Garwood Point-resolved Spectroscopy (MEGA-PRESS) acquisitions. In vivo, the quality and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of HERMES spectra are similar to those of sequentially acquired MEGA-PRESS spectra, with the benefit of saving half the acquisition time."}

The study on drug loading, using salicylic acid (SA) as a model drug, was performed. The results showed that the encapsulation efficiency (EE) increased as drug -to- microgel ratio was increased. Higher EE can be achieved with the increase in degree of crosslinking, by increasing the amount of MBA from 0.01 g to 0.03 g. In addition, the highest EE (61.1%) was observed at pH 3. The highest release of SA (60%) was noticed at pH 2.4, while the lowest one (49.4%) was obtained at pH 7.4. Moreover, the highest release of SA was enhanced by the presence of 0.2 M NaCl.

However, mitochondrial regulators that manage the rate of differentiation or cell fate have been rarely identified. This study aimed to determine the potential mitochondrial factor that controls the differentiation of ESCs into cardiac myocytes. We induced cardiomyocyte differentiation from mouse ESCs (mESCs) and performed microarray assays to assess messenger RNA (mRNA) expression changes at differentiation day 8 (D8) compared with undifferentiated mESCs (D0). Among the differentially expressed genes, Pdp1 expression was significantly decreased (27-fold) on D8 compared to D0, which was accompanied by suppressed mitochondrial indices, including ATP levels, membrane potential, ROS and mitochondrial Ca(2+). Notably, Pdp1 overexpression significantly enhanced the mitochondrial indices and pyruvate dehydrogenase activity and reduced the expression of cardiac differentiation marker mRNA and the cardiac differentiation rate compared to a mock control. In confirmation of this, a knockdown of the Pdp1 gene promoted the expression of cardiac differentiation marker mRNA and the cardiac differentiation rate. In conclusion, our results suggest that mitochondrial PDP1 is a potential regulator that controls cardiac differentiation at an early differentiation stage in ESCs."}

DNA / C14DMAO in Tris-HCl buffer solution with pH = 7.2 is transparent at 25 \u00b0C, indicating that DNA molecules exist mainly in individuals and the binding of C14DMAO is weak. With the increase of temperature, the pH of the buffer solution continuously decreases, which leads to protonation of C14DMAO (C14DMAO + H(+) \u2192 C14DMAOH(+)) and an obvious increase of the turbidity of the samples. This indicates a stronger binding of the protonated C14DMAOH(+) to DNA. Further investigations demonstrated the formation of DNA / C14DMAOH(+) complexes, in which the stretched DNA molecules are effectively compacted as evidenced from UV-vis absorptions, circular dichroism (CD) measurements, atomic force microscopy (AFM) observations, dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements and agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE). Interestingly, when the temperature is turned back to 25 \u00b0C, the compacted DNA molecules can fully recover to the stretched conformation. This cycle can be repeated several times without obvious loss of efficiency. The effect of the chain length of CnDMAO has also been investigated. When C14DMAO was replaced by C12DMAO, similar phenomena can be observed with a slightly higher critical surfactant concentration for DNA compaction and a slightly lower pH of Tris-HCl buffer solution with pH = 6.8. For the DNA / C10DMAO system, however, no DNA compaction was observed even in Tris-HCl buffer solution with a much lower pH and a much higher C10DMAO concentration. The negative charges of DNA molecules can easily be neutralized by positive charges of cationic CnDMAOH(+) (n = 12 and 14) micelles.

A custom-made simulation system was built based upon a common chassis of a series of previously described ERCP simulators. The papilla is made out of organic material and can be cut by high frequency current. The advancement of guidewires and other instruments within transparent mock bile ducts can be viewed in the window of the simulator without the need for fluoroscopy. The ERCP B II / Roux-en-Y simulation system was first evaluated during an ERCP course. There were no technical problems related to the novel simulator during the course. After sphincterotomy, the organic papillae could easily be exchanged within a few seconds. Overall, the novel B II / Roux-en-Y simulator achieved favorable results by trainees and expert endoscopists in all categories assessed. The new B II / Roux-en-Y mechanical simulator is simple and practicable. A first evaluation during an ERCP course showed promising results."}

The foye-1 gene was ligated into a pET16bp expression vector system, and the enzyme was produced in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3; pLysS) cells in yields of 10 mg L(-1). FOYE-1 showed remarkable activity and rates on N-phenylmaleimide and N-phenyl-2-methylmaleimide (up to 89 U mg(-1), >97 % conversion, 95 % (R)-selective) with both nicotinamide cofactors, NADPH and NADH. The catalytic efficiency with NADPH was 27 times higher compared to NADH. At the temperature maximum (50 \u00b0C) and pH optimum (6.5), activity was almost doubled to 160 U mg(-1).

In addition, synergistic or additive activity between ALT and aminoglycoside antibiotics or \u03b2-lactam antibiotics in vitro was identified. Moreover, ALT was documented to augment clearance of streptomycin (STR) and ampicillin (AMP) against S. aureus in a murine infection model.

Thus these proteins are named as argyrophilic-NOR (AgNOR)-associated proteins. We aimed to investigate any possible effects of renal I/R injury on the NOR protein synthesis and association between the AgNOR proteins amount and histopathological injuring score. Nine female wistar-albino rats with weight of 200-250g were included into the study. The animals were randomly divided in two groups, a Control Group and an I/R Group. In I/R group, rats were subjected to 45 minutes of renal pedicle occlusion followed by 24 hours of reperfusion. In the control group no drug injections or ischemia reperfusion were performed in animals. Then histopathological injury score, mean AgNOR number and total AgNOR area / nuclear area (TAA / NA) were detected for each rat. The differences between control and I/R groups were significant for histopathological injury scores (p = 0.016). Also the differences between control group and I/R group were significant for mean AgNOR number (p = 0.000) and TAA/NA ratio (p = 0.000).

In Experiment 1, participants with PD were rated as significantly more facially expressive than healthy controls; moreover, ratings demonstrated that PD patients were routinely mistaken for experiencing a negative emotion, whereas controls were rated as displaying a more positive emotion than they reported feeling. In Experiment 2, results showed that age-peers rated PD patients as significantly less socially desirable than control participants. Specifically, PD patients were rated as less involved, interested, friendly, intelligent, optimistic, attentive, and physically attractive than healthy controls. Taken together, our results point to a disconnect between how PD patients report feeling and attributions that others make about their emotions and social characteristics, underlining significant social challenges of the disease.

There is paucity of specialized health services for the elderly in Africa. Nigeria, with a population of over 170 million, did not have any healthcare facility with dedicated services for the elderly until 2012. The University of Benin Teaching Hospital (UBTH) in Nigeria was established in 1973 and created its geriatrics unit in October 2013. A prepared environment and trained interdisciplinary teams are pivotal in providing effective healthcare services for the elderly. The ongoing UBTH geriatrics project aims to provide specialized interdisciplinary health services to older adults and to provide training and continuing professional development in geriatrics for healthcare staff. In developing our inpatient services, we adopted the acute care for elders (ACE) model and worked in tandem with the \"ABCs\" of implementing ACE units. In the face of limited resources, it was possible to establish a functional geriatrics unit with a trained interdisciplinary team. Family participation is central in our practice. Since October 2013, residents and house officers in internal medicine have been undertaking 4- and 12- weekly rotations, respectively. There is also a robust academic program, which includes once- weekly geriatric pharmacotherapy seminars, once- weekly interdisciplinary seminars, and 2- weekly journal club meetings alternating with seminars on geriatric assessment tools.

Compensated dating typically involves the use of information communication technology to advertise, search, bargain, and eventually arrange for transactional sex. The technology enables the sexual partners to maintain privacy and secrecy in transactional sex. Such secrecy necessitates the girls ' disclosure about their life experiences in order to address the concern. The disclosure is the focus of the present qualitative study of 27 girls practicing the dating in Hong Kong, China. Based on the disclosure, the study presents a grounded theory that epitomizes engagement in compensated dating by referential choice. Such a referential choice theory unravels that choice with reference to the family push and social norms sustains the engagement. Meanwhile, the choice rests on expectancy and reinforcement from experiential learning about compensated dating. The theory thus implies ways to undercut the engagement through diverting the referential choice of the dating."}

The aim of this study was to simulate the deposition distribution of both components of this drug within the airways based on realistic airflow measurements. Breathing parameters of 25 healthy adults (11 females and 14 males) were acquired while inhaling through Turbuhaler(\u00ae). Individual specific emitted doses and particle size distributions of Symbicort(\u00ae) Turbuhaler(\u00ae) were determined. A self-developed particle deposition model was adapted and validated to simulate the deposition of budesonide (inhaled corticosteroid; ICS) and formoterol (long acting \u03b22 agonist; LABA) in the upper airways and lungs of the healthy volunteers. Based on current simulations the emitted doses varied between 50.4% and 92.5% of the metered dose for the ICS, and between 38% and 96.1% in case of LABA component depending on the individual inhalation flow rate. This variability induced a notable inter- individual spread of the deposited lung doses (mean: 33.6%, range: 20.4%-48.8% for budesonide and mean: 29.8%, range: 16.4%-42.9% for formoterol). Significant inter-gender differences were also observed. Average lung dose of budesonide was 29.2% of the metered dose for females and 37% for males, while formoterol deposited with 26.4% efficiency for females and 32.5% for males. Present results also highlighted the importance of breath-holding after inhalation of the drug. About a half of the total lung deposition occurred during breath-hold at 9.6s average breath-hold time.

However, given that HIV-1 drug-resistant strains are often less fit than the wild-type strains, it is expected that drug-resistant strains that are present during the primary phase of the HIV-1 infection are replaced by the fitter wild-type strains. This replacement of HIV-1 resistant mutations involves the emergence of wild-type strains by a process of backward mutation. How quickly the replacement happens is dependent on the class of HIV-1 mutation group. We estimate the backward mutation rates and relative fitness of various mutational groups known to confer HIV-1 drug resistance. We do this by fitting a stochastic model to data for individuals who were originally infected by an HIV-1 strain carrying any one of the known drug resistance -conferring mutations and observed over a period of time to see whether the resistant strain is replaced. To do this, we seek a distribution, generated from simulations of the stochastic model, that best describes the observed (clinical data) replacement times of a given mutation. We found that Lamivudine/Emtricitabine -associated mutations have a distinctly higher, backward mutation rate and low relative fitness compared to the other classes (as has been reported before) while protease inhibitors -associated mutations have a slower backward mutation rate and high relative fitness. For the other mutation classes, we found more uncertainty in their estimates."}

Participants made choices between hypothetical safety partnerships composed by experimentally varying 15 four-level partnership design attributes. Participants preferred an approach to safety based on partnerships between patients and staff rather than a model delegating responsibility for safety to hospital staff. They valued the opportunity to participate in point of service safety partnerships, such as identity and medication double checks, that might afford an immediate risk reduction. Latent class analysis yielded two segments. Actively engaged participants (73.3%) comprised outpatients with higher education, who anticipated more benefits to safety partnerships, were more confident in their ability to contribute, and were more intent on participating. They were more likely to prefer a personal engagement strategy, valued scientific evidence, preferred a more active approach to safety education, and advocated disclosure of errors. The passively engaged segment (26.7%) anticipated fewer benefits, were less confident in their ability to contribute, and were less intent on participating. They were more likely to prefer an engagement strategy based on signage. They preferred that staff explain why they thought patients should help make care safer and decide whether errors were disclosed. Inpatients, those with immigrant backgrounds, and those with less education were more likely to be in this segment.

In this study, we fabricated three-dimensional composite nanofibre macrostructures of polycaprolactone (PCL) with different concentrations of polyaniline (PANi) by employing an improved electrospinning technology with a specially designed collector. The 3D structures possessed cap-like macrostructures with centimetre-scale thickness and interconnected pore nanotextures with nanometre-scale nanofibres. To estimate the biocompatibility of the 3D PCL / PANi composite nanofibre macrostructures, mouse myoblasts (C2C12 cells) were cultured as model cells. The initial responses of C2C12 cells to the 3D PCL / PANi composite macrostructures were significantly superior to those to pure PCL, that is, the cells exhibited typical myoblast-like morphologies with obvious pseudopodia and the moderate incorporation (less than 2.0 wt%) of conductive PANi facilitated cell proliferation, which indicated that PANi has appreciable cell affinity. Moreover, the addition of conductive PANi to the 3D composite nanofibre macrostructures considerably enhanced myoblast differentiation and myotube maturation. These results suggest that electrospun 3D PCL / PANi composite nanofibre macrostructures would have promising applications in tissue engineering."}

Pandemic influenza occurs through a major antigenic change of the influenza A virus, which can originate from other hosts. Although new antigenic variants of the influenza A virus replace formerly circulating seasonal and pandemic viruses, replacement mechanisms remain poorly understood. A stochastic individual-based SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) model with two viral strains (formerly circulating old strain and newly emerged strain) was developed for simulations to elucidate the replacement mechanisms. Factors and conditions of virus and host populations affecting the replacement were identified. Replacement is more likely to occur in tropical regions than temperate regions. The magnitude of the ongoing epidemic by the old strain, herd immunity against the old strain, and timing of appearance of the new strain are not that important for replacement. It is probable that the frequency of replacement by a pandemic virus is higher than a seasonal virus because of the high initial susceptibility and high basic reproductive number of the pandemic virus. The findings of this study on replacement mechanisms could lead to a better understanding of virus transmission dynamics and may possibly be helpful in establishing an effective strategy to mitigate the impact of seasonal and pandemic influenza."}

Prior studies have shown that nearly half of postpartum tubal ligation (PPTL) requests go unfulfilled. This study seeks to establish whether obstetric or medical risk status influences patients ' request for or subsequent completion of PPTL. This study was a retrospective cohort study of women delivering at a university hospital in 2009-2010 who received prenatal care in the faculty and resident clinics. High-risk status was defined by Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine guidelines. Documentation of contraceptive plan and administration of contraceptive methods was abstracted from patient records. Subsequent pregnancies through March 1, 2013, were abstracted. Of 3063 participants (2048 low risk and 1015 high risk), 231 requested PPTL (7.5%). This was more likely among high-risk patients than low-risk patients (10.0% vs. 6.3%, p<.001), those with public insurance (13.8% vs. 3.2%, p<.001) and those with an unintended index pregnancy (13.8% vs. 4.1%, p<.001). Of the patients requesting PPTL, 118 (51.1%) underwent the procedure immediately postpartum. Completion was not associated with high-risk status (54.0%), or with race, insurance status or parity. Among 113 women with an unfulfilled PPTL request, there were 17 subsequent pregnancies (15.0%) during the 27 months of follow-up. Though women with high-risk pregnancies were more likely to request PPTL, they were not more likely to complete the procedure. Over one third of high-risk patients ' requests were unfulfilled, indicating that significant barriers may remain. Though women with high-risk pregnancies were more likely to request PPTL, they were not more likely to complete the procedure. Providers should consider these procedures urgent, especially in high-risk women, and advocate for their patients ' access to this procedure."}

Given the role of the gut microbiota in regulating host metabolism, we explored the effect of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) on the modifications of gut microbiota with regard to the potential influence of food intake and/or weight loss and examined their links with host metabolism. Zucker diabetic fatty rats were divided into the following groups: RYGB; sham-operated with pair-fed as RYGB; sham-operated fed ad libitum; and SG. The metabolic effects and gut microbiota profile were analyzed 10 weeks postoperatively. Associations between discriminating genera and metabolic markers after RYGB were explored. The 2 procedures induced similar glucose improvement and increased flora diversity after 10 weeks compared with sham-operated groups. RYGB induced a marked higher relative abundance of Proteobacteria / Gammaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria and increased emergence of Fusobacteria and Clostridium, whereas SG resulted in more abundant Actinobacteria compared with other groups. Most of the 12 discriminant genera correlated with changes in metabolic phenotype, but only 28.6% of these correlations were independent of weight, and 4 discriminant genera still negatively correlated with serum insulin level independent of food intake and weight loss after RYGB. These data demonstrate that RYGB and SG surgery produced similar diversity but different microbiota compositions changes in Zucker diabetic fatty rats. These findings stimulate deeper explorations of functions of the discriminate microbiota and the mechanisms linking postsurgical modulation of gut microbiota and improvements in insulin resistance."}

In rats administered 30mg/kg of AUY922, the AUC 0-24 h and Cmax are comparable to that in patients at 70mg/m(2). AUY922 at \u226530mg/kg was poorly tolerated by rats with morbidity or mortality generally after the third weekly treatment. Electroretinography (ERG) changes were observed at doses \u226530mg/kg. The ERG changes were dose dependent, consistent with an effect on the photoreceptors, and fully reversible. The ERG effects could not be minimized by decreasing the Cmax while maintaining AUC. Histopathological changes were seen mainly when rats were administered AUY922 at 100mg/kg. The 2- hour infusion of AUY922 at 100mg/kg caused disorganization of the outer segment photoreceptor morphology in male Brown Norway rats; the severity of the disorganization increased with the number of administrations, but was reversible during a 4- week posttreatment period. There was no major difference in ocular response between Brown Norway and Wistar rats. No changes in serum iron levels, and no changes in rhodopsin, PDE6\u03b1, \u03b2-transducin concentrations, or retinal pigment epithelium-specific protein RPE65 expression were observed after single and multiple infusions of AUY922 at 100mg/kg compared to vehicle-treated controls.

MRI exams were performed on two 3 Tesla Philips Ingenia systems using 32 channel head coil arrays. After local institutional review board approval, the 3D spiral-based pCASL technique was added to a standard brain MRI exam and evaluated in 13 pediatric patients (average age: 11.7\u00b16.4years, range: 1.4-22.2years). All patients were administered ACZ for clinically indicated reasons. Quantitative whole-brain CBF measurements were computed pre - and post - ACZ to assess cerebrovascular reserve. 3D spiral pCASL data were successfully reconstructed in all 13 cases. In 11 patients, CBF increased 2.8% to 93.2% after administration of ACZ. In the two remaining patients, CBF decreased by 2.4 to 6.0% after ACZ. The group average change in CBF due to ACZ was approximately 25.0% and individual changes were statistically significant (p<0.01) in all patients using a paired t-test analysis. CBF perfusion data were diagnostically useful in supporting conventional MR angiography and clinical findings. 3D cylindrically-distributed spiral pCASL MRI provides a robust approach to assess cerebral blood flow and reserve in pediatric patients."}

We conducted a two-armed experiment to evaluate student satisfaction and content mastery for an introductory pediatric radiology topic, taught by either an interactive digital game or with a traditional didactic lecture. Medical students participating in a fourth-year radiology elective were invited to participate. Student cohorts were alternatively given a faculty - supervised 1h session playing a simple interactive digital Tic-tac-toe quiz module on pediatric gastrointestinal radiology or a 1h didactic introductory lecture on the same topic. Survey questions assessed the learners' perceived ability to recall the material as well as their satisfaction with the educational experience. Results of an end-of-rotation exam were reviewed to evaluate a quantitative measure of learning between groups. Survey responses were analyzed with a chi-squared test. Exam results for both groups were analyzed with a paired Student's t-test. Students in the lecture group had higher test scores compared to students in the game group (4.0/5 versus 3.6/5, P = 0.045). Students in the lecture group reported greater understanding and recall of the material than students in the game group (P < 0.001 and P = 0.004, respectively). Students in the lecture group perceived the lecture to be more enjoyable and a better use of their time compared to those in the game group (P = 0.04 and P < 0.001, respectively). There was no statistically significant difference between the lecture and game group in ability to maintain interest (P = 0.187).

The present study investigated the role of gga-miR-21 in chicken pre-adipocyte proliferation. Cell proliferation assay and gene expression analysis of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) showed that the gga-miR-21 mimic inhibited pre-adipocyte proliferation. In contrast, the gga-miR-21 inhibitor enhanced pre-adipocyte proliferation. The subsequent investigation identified Kruppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) mRNA as a target of gga-miR-21. The gga-miR-21 mimic inhibited KLF5 3(')UTR reporter activity and decreased endogenous KLF5 expression in primary pre-adipocytes. KLF5 knockdown using RNAi had a similar effect to that of the gga-miR-21 mimic on cell proliferation. The promoting effect of the gga-miR-21 inhibitor on pre-adipocyte proliferation was partially attenuated by KLF5 knockdown.

We assessed whether MED reduced users ' targeted barriers and if barrier reductions were associated with within-participant improvements in adherence or glycemic control (HbA1c). Adults (N = 80) with type 2 diabetes completed self-report measures identifying barriers to adherence at baseline and monthly for 3 months.

In the present study we have used microarrays to investigate the presence of virulence genes in S. aureus isolates from dairy cows with acute clinical mastitis (n=70) and correlated the findings to other genotypic and phenotypic characteristics. Among the most commonly found virulence factors were genes encoding several hemolysin types, leukocidins D and lukM / lukF-P83, clumping factors A and B, fibrinogen binding protein and fibronectin-binding protein A. Some virulence factors e.g. fibronectin-binding protein B and Staphylococcus aureus surface protein G were less common. Genes coding for several staphylococcal enterotoxins and toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) were commonly found, especially in one major pulsotype. No beta-lactamase genes were found in any common pulsotype, while present in some rare pulsotypes, indicated to be of human origin. Production of TSST-1, enterotoxins, hemolysins and beta-lactamase could all be positively correlated to presence of the corresponding genes.

The Southern Altay Mountains represent the adder's southern distribution limit in Central Asia, whereas its population status has never been assessed. We conducted, for the first time, field surveys for the adder at two areas of Southern Altay Mountains using a combination of line transects and random searches. We also described the morphological characteristics of the collected specimens and conducted analyses of external morphology and molecular phylogeny. The results showed that the adder distributed in both survey sites and we recorded a total of 34 sightings. In Kanas river valley, the estimated encounter rate over a total of 137 km transects was 0.15 \u00b1 0.05 sightings /km. The occurrence of melanism was only 17%. The small size was typical for the adders in Southern Altay Mountains in contrast to other geographic populations of the nominate subspecies. A phylogenetic tree obtained by Bayesian Inference based on DNA sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome b (1,023 bp) grouped them within the Northern clade of the species but failed to separate them from the subspecies V. b. sachalinensis. Our discovery extends the distribution range of V. berus and provides a basis for further researches. We discuss the hypothesis that the adder expands its distribution border to the southwest along the mountains ' elevation gradient, but the population abundance declines gradually due to a drying climate."}

Here, we investigate whether biomolecules involved in thiamin binding and transport could be blocked by a range of different pollutants. We used in silico docking of five compound classes (25 compounds in total) to each of five targets (prion protein, ECF-type ABC transporter, thi-box riboswitch receptor, thiamin pyrophosphokinase, and YKoF protein) and subsequently performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to assess the stability of the complexes. The compound classes were thiamin analogues (control), pesticides, veterinary medicines, polychlorinated biphenyls, and dioxins, all of which are prevalent in the environment to some extent. A few anthropogenic compounds were found to bind the ECF-type ABC transporter, but none binds stably to prion protein. For the riboswitch, most compounds remained in their binding pockets during 50 ns of MD simulation, indicating that RNA provides a promiscuous binding site. In both YKoF and thiamin pyrophosphokinase (TPK), most compounds remain tightly bound. However, TPK biomolecules undergo pollutant - induced conformational changes. Although most compounds are found to bind to some of these targets, a larger data set is needed along with more quantitative methods like free energy perturbation calculations before firm conclusions can be drawn. This study is in part a test bed for large-scale quantitative computational screening of interactions between biological entities and pollutant molecules."}

MRSA isolates from clinical specimens obtained by the main New Zealand veterinary diagnostic laboratories between June 2012 and June 2013, were genotypically characterised by DNA microarray hybridisation analysis and spa typing. In addition, nasal or perineal skin swabs collected from a cross-sectional sample of dogs (n=361) and cats (n=225) attending 29 veterinary clinics in Auckland during the same period were analysed for MRSA by culture. Eight MRSA clinical isolates were submitted for characterisation by the participating laboratories. The isolates originated from five dogs, including two isolates from the same dog, one foal, and one isolate had no identification of the source. The strain - types identified were AK3 (ST-5 SCCmecIV t045; n=1), USA500 (ST8 SCCmecIV t064; n=1), WSPP (ST30 SCCmecIV t019; n=1), Rhine Hesse (ST5 SCCmecII t002; n=2), and EMRSA-15 (ST22 SCCmecIV t032; n=3). No MRSA were isolated from 586 cultured swabs. Methicillin-susceptible S. aureus were detected in 9/257 (3.5%) swabs and non-aureus staphylococci in 22/257 (8.5%) swabs. The estimated true MRSA subclinical colonisation prevalence was 0%, with an upper 95% CI boundary of 1.9% for cats and 1.4% for dogs. The modest number of MRSA isolates submitted for this study by the participating laboratories suggests clinical MRSA infection in animals in New Zealand continues to be sporadic. "}

We cannot rule out bias due to the non-random sampling of dogs and cats, but the apparent colonisation prevalence of 0% was consistent with the low prevalence of subclinical colonisation in humans in New Zealand. These similarities indicate the epidemiology of animal and human MRSA infections are linked. In the last decade, the prevalence of human MRSA infections in New Zealand has steadily increased. This is the second published study of MRSA in animals in New Zealand.

The Perspective database, an all-payer database that collects data from more than 500 hospitals, was used to perform a retrospective cohort study of women with vulvar cancer who underwent vulvectomy and lymph node assessment from 2006 to 2015. Multivariable models were used to determine factors associated with sentinel node biopsy. Length of stay and cost were compared between women who underwent sentinel node biopsy and lymphadenectomy. Among 2,273 women, sentinel node biopsy was utilized in 618 (27.2%) and 1,655 (72.8%) underwent inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy. Performance of sentinel node biopsy increased from 17.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 12.0-22.0%) in 2006 to 39.1% (95% CI 27.1-51.0%) in 2015. In a multivariable model, women treated more recently were more likely to have undergone sentinel node biopsy, whereas women with more comorbidities and those treated at rural hospitals were less likely to have undergone the procedure. The median length of stay was shorter for those undergoing sentinel node biopsy (median 2 days, interquartile range 1-3) compared with women who underwent inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy (median 3 days, interquartile range 2-4). The cost of sentinel node biopsy was $7,599 (interquartile range $5,739-9,922) compared with $8,095 (interquartile range $5,917-11,281) for lymphadenectomy. The use of sentinel node biopsy for vulvar cancer has more than doubled since 2006. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is associated with a shorter hospital stay and decreased cost compared with inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy."}

The capability of colonizing woody tissue combined with the secretion of phytotoxic compounds is thought to underlie its pathogenicity and virulence. Here, we describe the repertoire of virulence factors and their transcriptional dynamics as the fungus feeds on different substrates and colonizes the woody stem. We assembled and annotated a highly contiguous genome using single molecule real-time DNA sequencing. Transcriptome profiling by RNA-sequencing determined the genome -wide patterns of expression of virulence factors both in vitro (potato dextrose agar or medium amended with grape wood as substrate) and in planta. Pairwise statistical testing of differential expression followed by co-expression network analysis revealed that physically clustered genes coding for putative virulence functions were induced depending on substrate or stage of plant infection. Co-expressed gene clusters were significantly enriched not only in genes associated with secondary metabolism, but also with cell wall degradation, suggesting that dynamic co-regulation of transcriptional networks contribute to multiple aspects of N. parvum virulence. In most of the co-expressed clusters, all genes shared at least a common motif in their promoter region indicative of co-regulation by the same transcription factor. Co-expression analysis also identified chromatin regulators with correlated expression with inducible clusters of virulence factors, suggesting a complex, multi-layered regulation of the virulence repertoire of N. parvum.

Nano-fibers composed of chitin and protein molecules form most of the organic matrix of the cuticle that, at the macroscale, is organized in up to eight hierarchical levels. At least two of them, the exo- and endocuticle, contain a mineral phase of mainly Mg - calcite, amorphous calcium carbonate and phosphate. The high number of hierarchical levels and the compositional diversity provide a high degree of freedom for varying the physical, in particular mechanical, properties of the material. This makes the cuticle a versatile material ideally suited to form a variety of skeletal elements that are adapted to different functions and the eco-physiological strains of individual species. This review presents our recent analytical, experimental and theoretical studies on the cuticle, summarising at which hierarchical levels structure and composition are modified to achieve the required physical properties. We describe our multi-scale hierarchical modeling approach based on the results from these studies, aiming at systematically predicting the structure - composition - property relations of cuticle composites from the molecular level to the macro-scale. This modeling approach provides a tool to facilitate the development of optimized biomimetic materials within a knowledge-based design approach."}

The chromosome -based draft genome sequence of the ' Chinese Spring ' common wheat cultivar enables the large-scale development of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based markers specific for homoeologs. Based on high-confidence ' Chinese Spring ' genes with known functions, we developed 183 putative homoeolog-specific markers for chromosomes 4B and 7B. These markers were used in PCR assays for the 4B and 7B nullisomes and their euploid synthetic hexaploid wheat (SHW) line that was newly generated from a hybridization between Triticum turgidum (AABB) and the wild diploid species Aegilops tauschii (DD). Up to 64% of the markers for chromosomes 4B or 7B in the SHW background were confirmed to be homoeolog-specific.

Data from the randomized controlled Resistance and Endurance exercise After ChemoTherapy (REACT) study were used for this study. The participants of the REACT study were randomly allocated to either a high intensity (HI) or low -to- moderate intensity (LMI) exercise program. Patients ' participation rate was defined as the cancer survivors ' decision to participate in the REACT study. Exercise adherence reflected participants ' attendance to the scheduled exercise sessions and their compliance to the prescribed exercises. High session attendance rates were defined as attending at least 80 % of the sessions. High compliance rates were defined as performing at least of 90 % of the prescribed exercise across all sessions. Correlates of exercise adherence were studied separately for HI and LMI exercise. Demographic, clinical, and physical factors were assessed using self-reported questionnaires. Relevant clinical information was extracted from medical records. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were applied to identify correlates that were significantly associated with participation, high session attendance, high compliance with resistance and high compliance with endurance exercises. Participants were more likely to have higher education, be non-smokers, have lower psychological distress, higher outcome expectations, and perceive more exercise barriers than non-participants. In HI exercise, higher self-efficacy was significantly associated with high session attendance and high compliance with endurance exercises, and lower psychological distress was significantly associated with high compliance with resistance exercise s. In LMI exercise, being a non-smoker was significantly associated with high compliance with resistance exercises and higher BMI was significantly associated with high compliance with resistance and endurance exercises. Furthermore, breast cancer survivors were less likely to report high compliance with resistance and endurance exercises in LMI exercise compared to survivors of other types of cancer. The discriminative ability of the multivariable models ranged from 0.62 to 0.75. Several demographic, clinical and psychosocial factors were associated with participation in and adherence to exercise among cancer survivors.

The results indicated that application of slag increased soil pH, plant -available silicon concentrations in soil, and decreased the bioavailability of metals compared with control treatment, whereas pulverous slag (S1) was more effective than granular slag (S2 and S3). The acid - extractable fraction of Cd in the spiked soil was significantly decreased with application of S1 at rates of 1 and 3 %, acid-extractable fractions of Cu and Zn were decreased when treated at 3 %. Use of S1 at both rates resulted in significantly lower Cd, Cu, and Zn concentrations in rice tissues than in controls by 82.6-92.9, 88.4-95.6, and 67.4-81.4 %, respectively. However, use of pulverous slag at 1 % significantly promotes rice growth, restricted rice growth when treated at 3 %.

Increasing parasitic resistance to existing antimalarials makes the necessity of novel avenues to treat this disease an urgent priority. The enzymes responsible for the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine are attractive drug targets to treat malaria as their selective inhibition leads to an arrest of the parasite's growth and cures malaria in a mouse model. We present here a detailed study that reveals a mode of action for two P. falciparum choline kinase inhibitors both in vitro and in vivo. The compounds present distinct binding modes to the choline / ethanolamine - binding site of P. falciparum choline kinase, reflecting different types of inhibition. Strikingly, these compounds primarily inhibit the ethanolamine kinase activity of the P. falciparum choline kinase, leading to a severe decrease in the phosphatidylethanolamine levels within P. falciparum, which explains the resulting growth phenotype and the parasites death. These studies provide an understanding of the mode of action, and act as a springboard for continued antimalarial development efforts selectively targeting P. falciparum choline kinase."}

In this study, pre-sensitization to female C57BL/6 mice with the skin of female BLAB/c mice generated a large number of Tm cells and resulted in rapid rejection of the secondly transplanted allografts. \u03b1-CD45RB did induce the tolerance to skin allograft primarily transplanted but failed to induce tolerance in the pre-sensitized mice. Donor-specific spleen cell transfusion (DST) alone also failed to induce the tolerance in the pre-sensitized recipients. Interestingly, combination of \u03b1-CD45RB with DST inhibited the rejection induced by memory T cells in the pre-sensitized mice. CD25+ T-cell depletion in \u03b1-CD45RB combined with DST therapy recipients could prevent skin allograft tolerance from establishing. In addition, adoptive transfer of donor -primed memory T cells into the tolerant recipients markedly broke the established tolerance.

A conjoint preference experiment began by asking respondents to imagine that they had just been diagnosed with lung cancer. Respondents then chose among procedures that differed regarding treatment modalities, the potential for treatment -related complications, the likelihood of recurrence, provider case volume, and distance needed to travel for treatment. Conjoint analysis derived relative weights for these attributes. A total of 225 responses were analyzed. Respondents were most willing to accept minimally invasive operations for treatment of their hypothetical lung cancer, followed by stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT); they were least willing to accept thoracotomy. Treatment type and risk of recurrence were the most important attributes from the conjoint experiment (each with a relative weight of 0.23), followed by provider volume (relative weight of 0.21), risk of major complications (relative weight of 0.18), and distance needed to travel for treatment (relative weight of 0.15). Procedural and treatment preferences did not vary with demographics, self-reported health status, or familiarity with the procedures.

Recent data demonstrate a transcriptional upregulation of several autophagy genes as a mechanism that controls autophagy in response to starvation. Here we report that despite the significant upregulation of mRNA of the essential autophagy initiation gene ULK1, its protein level is rapidly reduced under starvation. Although both autophagic and proteasomal systems contribute to the degradation of ULK1, under prolonged nitrogen deprivation, its level was still reduced in ATG7 knockout cells, and only initially stabilized in cells treated with the lysosomal or proteasomal inhibitors. We demonstrate that under starvation, protein translation is rapidly diminished and, similar to treatments with the proteosynthesis inhibitors cycloheximide or anisomycin, is associated with a significant reduction of ULK1. Furthermore, it was found that inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory complexes or the mitochondrial ATP synthase function that could also take place in the absence of substrates, promote upregulation of ULK1 mRNA and protein expression in an AMPK - dependent manner in U1810 lung cancer cells growing in complete culture medium. These inhibitors could also drastically increase the ULK1 protein in U1810 cells with knockout of ATG13, where the ULK1 expression is significantly diminished. However, such upregulation of ULK1 protein is negligible under starvation conditions, further signifying the contribution of translation and suggesting that transcriptional upregulation of ULK1 protein will be diminished under such conditions. Thus, we propose a model where inhibition of protein translation, together with the degradation systems, limit autophagy during starvation."}

Ample evidence indicated that microRNAs (miRs) could regulate post-transcriptional gene expression and neuronal disease. In the present study, we have evaluated the effects and mechanism of miR-22 in PC12 pheochromocytoma cells treated with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) to mimic PD. RT-PCR results showed that the expression of miR-22 is downregulated in 6-OHDA - treated PC12 cells, and the overexpression of miR-22 significantly promoted the survival and proliferation of 6-OHDA - induced PC12 cells, whereas miR-22 inhibitor reversed these effects. In addition, PC12 cells were treated with miR-22 mimics or inhibitor following 6-OHDA administration, which medicated ROS production and upregulation or downregulation of caspase-3 activity, respectively. A luciferase reporter assay revealed that transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) is a direct target gene of miR-22, and miR-22 overexpression markedly downregulated the level of TRPM7. Strikingly, further analysis showed that miR-22 mediated 6-OHDA - induced PC12 cell survival and proliferation by targeting TRPM7. Taken together, the present study showed that miR-22 overexpression exhibited neuroprotective and reversal effects on the 6-OHDA - induced PC12 cell growth and apoptosis by targeting TRPM7."}

The influx of injuries and illnesses in rural areas where OCRs are often held can impose a large burden on emergency medical services (EMS) and local EDs. Literature concerning the safety of these events is minimal and mostly consists of media reports. We sought to characterise the injury and illness profile of OCRs and the level of medical care required. This study analysed OCR events occurring in eight locations across Canada from May to August 2015 (total 45 285 participants). Data were extracted from event medical charts of patients presenting to the onsite medical team, including injury or illness type, onsite treatment and disposition. There were 557 race participants treated at eight OCR events (1.2% of all participants). There were 609 medical complaints in total. Three quarters of injuries were musculoskeletal in nature. Eighty-nine per cent returned to the event with no need for further medical care. The majority of treatments were completed with first aid and basic medical equipment. Eleven patients (2% of patients) required transfer to hospital by EMS for presentations including fracture, dislocation, head injury, chest pain, fall from height, and abdominal pain. We found that 1.2% of race participants presented to onsite medical services. The majority of complaints were minor and musculoskeletal in nature. Only 2% of those treated were transferred to hospital through EMS. This is consistent with other types of mass gathering events."}

The impact of modern medical management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) on surgical necessity and outcomes remains unclear. We hypothesized that surgery rates have decreased while outcomes have worsened due to operating on \" sicker \" patients since the introduction of biologic medications. The Nationwide Inpatient Sample and ICD-9-CM codes were used to identify inpatient admissions for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Trends in IBD nutrition, surgeries, and postoperative complications were determined. There were 191,743 admissions for IBD during the study period. Surgery rates were largely unchanged over the study period, ranging from 9 to 12 % of admissions in both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The rate of poor nutrition increased by 67 % in ulcerative colitis and by 83 % in Crohn's disease. Rates of postoperative anastomotic leak (10.2-13.9 %) were unchanged over the years. Postoperative infection rates decreased by 17 % in Crohn's disease (18 % in 2003 to 15 % in 2012; P < 0.001) but did not show a trend in any direction in ulcerative colitis. Rates of IBD surgery have remained stable while postoperative infectious complications have remained stable or decreased since the implementation of biologic therapies.

A retrospective study involving 7 centers over a 5- year period beginning in 2011 was performed. Twenty-one patients (median 33.9 years) were identified. The most common diagnosis was single ventricle physiology (52%), 9 palliated by Fontan operation and 2 by aortopulmonary shunts: d-transposition of the great arteries after Mustard / Senning (n=2), tetralogy of Fallot (n=2), aortic valve disease (n=2), and other biventricular surgery (n=4). A prior cardiac device had been implanted in 7 (33%). The ICD indication was primary prevention in 67% and secondary in 33% patient s. The most common reason for subcutaneous ICD placement was limited transvenous access for ventricular lead placement (n=10) followed by intracardiac right-to-left shunt (n=5). Ventricular arrhythmia was induced in 17 (81%) and was converted with \u226480 Joules in all. There was one implant complication related to infection, not requiring device removal. Over a median follow-up of 14 months, 4 patients (21%) received inappropriate and 1 (5%) patient received appropriate shocks. There was one arrhythmic death related to asystole in a single ventricle patient. Subcutaneous ICD implantation is feasible for adults with congenital heart disease patients. Most candidates have single ventricle heart disease and limited transvenous options for ICD placement.

Many schizophrenia susceptibility genes were identified but the picture remains unclear due to inconsistent or contradictory genetic association studies. This confusion may, in part, be because symptoms result from the combined interaction of many genes and these interacting genes are associated with specific sub-phenotypes of schizophrenia rather than schizophrenia as a whole. This study investigates the relationship between schizophrenia susceptibility genes and schizophrenia sub-phenotypes by identifying multiple gene variant interactions. Fifty SNPs from 21 genes were genotyped in 235 Australian participants with schizophrenia screened for various phenotypes. Schizophrenia participants were grouped into relevant phenotype clusters using cluster analysis and normalized phenotype cluster scores were calculated for each patient. The relationship between genotypes and normalized phenotype cluster scores were analyzed by linear regression analysis. Three phenotype clusters were identified. There was some overlap in symptoms between phenotype clusters, particularly for depression. However, cluster 1 appears to be characterized by speech disorder and affective behavior symptoms, cluster 2 has predominantly hallucination symptoms and cluster 3 has mainly delusion symptoms. Interaction of five SNPs was found to have an effect on cluster 1 symptoms; ten SNPs on cluster 2 symptoms; and eight SNPs on cluster 3 symptoms. The interaction of specific susceptibility genes is likely to lead to specific clinical sub-phenotypes of schizophrenia. Larger patient cohorts with more extensive clinical data will improve the detection of gene interactions and the resultant schizophrenia clinical phenotypes."}

The critical role of methylation in the biology of immunocytes has increasingly been surveyed to discover disease etiology. DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) is an enzyme, which establishes and regulates patterns of methylated cytosine residues. The aim of the current investigation was to unveil if methylation circumstances of CpG sites in DNMT1 promoter could affect the mRNA expression level of this gene in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from AS patients. PBMCs were isolated from whole blood of 40 AS patients and 40 healthy individuals. Total RNA and DNA contents of leukocytes were extracted. Afterward, quantitative analysis was carried out by real-time PCR using the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix. Finally, to determine the methylation level, PCR products of bisulfite-treated DNA from patients and controls were sequenced. Compared with healthy controls, expression level of DNMT1 in AS patients was significantly downregulated. Methylation of DNMT1 promoter was significantly higher in AS patients in comparison to controls. While a negative correlation between methylation and expression level of DNMT1 was observed in AS patients, both methylation and expression level of DNMT1 did not correlate with clinical manifestations. Considering the observation that decreased expression level of DNMT1 was associated with hypermethylation of DNMT1 promoter in PBMCs from AS patients, this survey suggests that dysregulation of DNMT1 expression through altered methylation level of other target genes would probably contribute to AS development."}

Silver nanoparticles were prepared from the reduction of silver nitrate and NaBH4 was used as reducing agent. Silver nanoparticles and extracts were mixed thoroughly and then coated by polyaniline. Prepared nanoparticles were characterized by Visual inspection, Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV), Fourier transform infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) techniques. Antibacterial activities of the synthesized silver nanoparticles were tested against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Salmonella typhi ATCC 14028, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853. UV-Vis spectrum of reaction mixture showed strong absorption peak with centering at 400 nm. The FT-IR results imply that Ag-NPs were successfully synthesized and capped with bio-compounds present in P. betle. TEM image showed that Ag-NPs formed were well dispersed with a spherical structures and particle size ranging from 10 to 30 nm. The result revealed that Ag-Extract NPs showed 32.78\u00b10.64 mm zone of inhibition against S. aureus, whereas norfloxacin (positive control) showed maximum 32.15\u00b10.40 mm zone of inhibition for S. aureus.

The most common complication is left bundle branch block (LBBB). The clinical impact of new-onset LBBB after TAVI remains controversial. The aim of this study was to analyze the clinical impact of new-onset LBBB in terms of mortality and morbidity (need for pacemakers and admissions for heart failure) at long-term follow-up. From April 2008 to December 2014, 220 patients who had severe aortic stenosis were treated with the implantation of a CoreValve prosthesis. Sixty-seven of these patients were excluded from the analysis, including 22 patients with pre-existing LBBB and 45 with a permanent pacemaker, implanted previously or within 72 hours of implantation. The remaining 153 patients were divided into 2 groups: group 1 (n = 80), those with persistent new-onset LBBB, and group 2 (n = 73), those without conduction disturbances after treatment. Both groups were followed up at 1 month, 6 months, 12 months, and yearly thereafter. Persistent new-onset LBBB occurred in 80 patients (36%) immediately after TAVI; 73 patients (33%) did not develop conduction disturbances. The mean follow-up time of both groups was 32 \u00b1 22 months (range 3 to 82 months), and there were no differences in time between the groups. There were no differences in mortality between the groups (39% vs 48%, p = 0.58). No differences were observed between the groups in re-hospitalizations for heart failure (11% vs 16%, p = 0.55). Group 1 did not require pacemaker implantation more often at follow-up (10% vs 13%, p = 0.38) than group 2. In conclusion, new-onset LBBB was not associated with a higher incidence of late need for a permanent pacemaker after CoreValve implantation. In addition, it was not associated with a higher risk of late mortality or re-hospitalization."}

The mechanism of action of lubiprostone is through increasing fluid secretion and lubrication of the intestinal lumen. The effects of lubiprostone on gastrointestinal transit and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) have not been adequately explored. The current study was designed to investigate whether lubiprostone (1) alters gastrointestinal transit and (2) affects SIBO in patients with constipation. A total of 29 female patients (mean age = 39 years; range: 19-64) with CC received 2 weeks of lubiprostone (24mcg b.i.d., P.O.). Stool consistency based on Bristol stool scale and the frequency of bowel movements (BMs) were recorded. Gastric emptying time, small bowel transit time, colon transit time (CTT), combined small and large bowel transit time (SLBTT) and whole gut transit time were measured using wireless motility capsule. The SIBO status was assessed by the lactulose breath test. Data were analyzed using Wilcoxon rank, Mann-Whitney U, Spearman\u05f3s rank correlation and Chi-square tests. Lubiprostone significantly softened the stool and increased the frequency of BM from median of 2 to 4 times per week. The CTT and SLBTT were significantly shorter in responders to lubiprostone (i.e., those with \u2265 2 times increase in the number of their weekly BM) compared with nonresponders. The higher frequency of BM after treatment was significantly correlated with the acceleration of CTT, SLBTT and whole gut transit time. In all, 17 out of 25 (68%) patients, who were tested for SIBO at baseline, were positive.

The current study aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of ADR using a laparoscopic technique for lumbar disc herniation. Symptomatic degenerative disc disease is the major cause of low back pain with lumbar segmental instability. ADR has increased in popularity as an alternative treatment for lumbar disc herniation. However, the traditional approach to spinal surgery carries the risk of catastrophic bleeding from injury to major vessels, as well as iatrogenic injury to the viscera and associated structures. Therefore, laparoscopic lumbar discectomy and ADR may represent a useful alternative. Twenty-two patients (8 males and 14 females) who were diagnosed with symptomatic degenerative disc disease were included in this study. Seven cases involved the L4/5 level, and 15 cases involved the L5/S1 level. All patients were ineffective after at least 6 months of conservative treatments; all patients were informed of the surgery before the operation and provided consent. Three-dimensional computed tomographic angiography (3D - CTA) of the iliac great blood vessels was completed before the surgery. All surgical procedures were performed under a laparoscope.

Objective To gain insight into how people with low literacy use and evaluate written drug information, and to identify ways in which they feel the patient leaflet can be improved, and in particular how images could be used. Setting Food banks and an education institution for Dutch language training in the Netherlands. Method Semi-structured focus groups and individual interviews were held with low-literate participants (n = 45). The thematic framework approach was used for analysis to identify themes in the data. Main outcome measure Low-literate people's experience with patient information leaflets, ideas for improvements, and perceptions on possible uses for visuals. Results Patient information leaflets were considered discouraging to use, and information difficult to find and understand. Many rely on alternative information sources. The leaflet should be shorter, and improved in terms of organisation, legibility and readability. Participants thought images could increase the leaflet's appeal, help ask questions, provide an overview, help understand textual information, aid recall, reassure, and even lead to increased confidence, empowerment and feeling of safety. Conclusion Already at the stages of paying attention to the leaflet and maintaining interest in the message, low-literate patients experience barriers in the communication process through written drug information.

In ten patients exhibiting a single - tooth gap, the surgical procedure included the preparation of mucoperiosteal flaps, a rigid fixation of CXBB (Geistlich Bio-Graft(\u00ae)) using an osteosynthesis screw, and contour augmentation. After 24 weeks of submerged healing, the primary endpoint was defined as the final ridge width sufficient to place an adequately dimensioned titanium implant at the respective sites. Secondary outcomes included, for example, the gain in ridge width (mm). Clinical parameters (e.g., bleeding on probing - BOP, probing depth - PD, mucosal recession - MR) were assessed immediately after the cementation of the crown and at the final visit. At 24 weeks, implant placement could be achieved in 8 of 10 patients exhibiting a mean gain in ridge width (mean \u00b1 SD) of 3.88 \u00b1 1.75 mm. Histological analysis has pointed to a homogeneous osseous organization of CXBB. The changes of mean BOP, PD, and MR values at the final visit amounted to 16.62 \u00b1 32.02%, 0.04 \u00b1 0.21 mm, and -0.04 \u00b1 0.12 mm, respectively. CXBB may be successfully used to support lateral alveolar ridge augmentation and two-stage implant placement."}

Although some studies suggested that a negative view of cancer may increase the level of depression, such an association has never been studied in the elderly population. Similarly, even though it is established that a negative self-perception of aging has deleterious consequences on mental and physical health in normal aging, the influence in pathological contexts, such as oncology, has not been studied. The main aim of this study is thus to analyze the effect of these two stigmas on the health of elderly oncology patients. 101 patients suffering from a cancer (breast, gynecological, lung or hematological) were seen as soon as possible after their diagnosis. Their self-perception of age, cancer view and health (physical and mental) was assessed. Multiple regressions showed that patients with a more negative self-perception of aging and/or more negative cancer view reported poorer global health. We also observed that negative self-perception of aging was associated with worse physical and mental health, whereas negative cancer views were only linked to worse mental health. No interaction was observed between these two stigmas, suggesting that their action is independent. Older patients with cancer face double stigmatization, due to negative self-perception of aging and cancer, and these stigmas have impacts on global and mental health. Self-perception of aging is also linked to physical health. Longitudinal studies will be necessary to analyze the direction of the association between this double stigmatization and health."}

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the natural growth of the aortic root after root-sparing aortic replacement. In all, 102 consecutive patients (mean age 61.8 \u00b1 12.5 years; 60% male) who had undergone root-sparing aortic replacement had sufficient retrievable information regarding their aortic root diameter at postoperative baseline and follow-up imaging by computed tomography or echocardiography. The annual growth rate was evaluated and also compared according to the influence of valve morphology and concomitant aortic valve replacement. Furthermore, the years of natural history that would require for root enlargement to meet a 50 mm threshold of the root diameter were calculated. The estimated growth rate of the aortic root after root-sparing aortic replacement is between 0.27 and 0.51 mm per year (mean 0.41 mm, varying according to the underlying diameter) and therefore fivefold less than other aortic regions. Accordingly, a root aneurysm indicating reoperation would not be expected for 29.1 years on average. Only patients with a diameter of 45 mm or more are at risk for reoperation, and not until at least after 10.4 years have passed. Neither the valve morphology (p = 0.62) nor concomitant aortic valve replacement (p = 0.86) influenced rate of root dilation. In nonsyndromic patients, the aortic root is the slowest growing portion of the thoracic aorta. Leaving the native root, as in root-sparing ascending aortic replacement, is a safe approach regarding secondary root intervention for aortic root diameters of 45 mm or less."}

In this study, 188 F8 recombinant inbred lines (RILs), derived from a intraspecific cross between HS46 and MARCABUCAG8US-1-88 were genotyped by the cotton 63K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) assay. Field trials were conducted in Sanya, Hainan Province, during the 2014-2015 cropping seasons under standard conditions. Results revealed significant differences (P < 0.05) among RILs, environments and replications for fiber quality and yield traits. Broad-sense heritabilities of all traits including fiber length, fiber uniformity, micronaire, fiber elongation, fiber strength, boll weight, and lint percentage ranged from 0.26 to 0.66. A 1784.28 cM (centimorgans) linkage map, harboring 2618 polymorphic SNP markers, was constructed, which had 0.68 cM per marker density. Seventy-one quantitative trait locus (QTLs) for fiber quality and yield traits were detected on 21 chromosomes, explaining 4.70~32.28% phenotypic variance, in which 16 were identified as stable QTLs across two environments. Meanwhile, 12 certain regions were investigated to be involved in the control of one (hotspot) or more (cluster) traits, mainly focused on Chr05, Chr09, Chr10, Chr14, Chr19, and Chr20. Nineteen pairs of epistatic QTLs (e-QTLs) were identified, of which two pairs involved in two additive QTLs.

COPD was established by intratracheal LPS injection combined with smoke fumigation over 30 days. On the first day of model establishment rats in the AEC group also received intratracheal instillation of 500,000 hAECs isolated from the placenta of healthy donors. The mean linear intercept (MLI) and mean alveolar number (MAN) were used to assess the degree of lung emphysema. IL-8 was measured using a radioimmunoassay, surfactant protein D (SP-D) was measured by ELISA, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2 and MMP8 expression was assessed by PCR. Smoke fumigation combined to LPS injection successfully established a COPD rat model with significant emphysema and airway inflammation, elevated MLI and MAN, elevated systemic and lung tissue levels of IL-8 and SP-D (P<0.05), and high expression of MMP2 and MMP8.

However, a potential disadvantage is the difficulty of linking the observed phenotype to a specific cellular target. To address this problem, we developed DePick, a computational target de-convolution tool to determine targets specifically linked to small-molecule phenotypic screens. We applied DePick to eight publicly available screens and predicted 59 drug target - phenotype associations. In addition to literature - based evidence for our predictions, we provide experimental support for seven predicted associations. Interestingly, our analysis led to the discovery of a previously unrecognized connection between the Wnt signaling pathway and an aromatase, CYP19A1. These results demonstrate that the DePick approach can not only accelerate target de-convolution but also aid in discovery of new functionally relevant biological relationships."}

This paper presents an overarching framework for practitioners to help them reorientate their communication with Aboriginal patients using ' clinical yarning '. Clinical yarning is a patient -centred approach that marries Aboriginal cultural communication preferences with biomedical understandings of health and disease. Clinical yarning consists of three interrelated areas: the social yarn, in which the practitioner aims to find common ground and develop the interpersonal relationship; the diagnostic yarn, in which the practitioner facilitates the patient's health story while interpreting it through a biomedical or scientific lens; and the management yarn, that employs stories and metaphors as tools for patients to help them understand a health issue so a collaborative management approach can be adopted. There is cultural and research evidence that supports this approach. Clinical yarning has the potential to improve outcomes for patients and practitioners."}

In recent years, New Delhi metallo-\u03b2-lactamase has been the focus as a predominant carbapenem resistance determinant. However, it is unclear which of the mechanisms might be adopted by a P. aeruginosa strain possessing both blaNDM-1 and an overexpressed MexAB-OprM system during carbapenem therapy. This study investigated the interplay of both mechanisms in clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa when exposed to meropenem. Five strains were used: (i) strain overexpressing MexAB-OprM but with no blaNDM-1; (ii) strain harbouring blaNDM-1 but expressing MexAB-OprM at basal level; (iii) strain possessing blaNDM-1 and overexpressing MexAB-OprM; (iv) P. aeruginosa PAO1; and (v) P. aeruginosa K2733-PAO1 (\u0394MexAB-OprM \u0394MexCD-OprJ \u0394MexEF-OprN \u0394MexXY-OprM) into which blaNDM-1 was cloned. Strains were incubated in Luria-Bertani broth with and without 1\u03bcg/mL meropenem. Total RNA was isolated at 45-min intervals and was immediately reverse transcribed to cDNA. This was repeated for 6h. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed for both resistance mechanisms. Meropenem exposure did not significantly elevate transcription of either the blaNDM-1 or mexA gene. However, an interesting finding was that upon single-dose exposure to carbapenem, the efflux pump system played a major role in bacterial survival compared with NDM-1. This study gives an insight into the bacterial response to carbapenem antibiotic when two different resistance mechanisms coexist. "}

Despite increasing recognition of this subspecies as a cause for human infectious diseases, limited information is known about its antibiotic resistance mechanism. In this study, we aim to identify the molecular mechanism underlying the high macrolide resistance of six S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus isolates from dead ducklings collected in several natural outbreaks in China during 2010-2013. All isolates exhibited multi-drug resistance including high macrolide resistance (MIC \u2265 1024 mg/L for erythromycin, and 512 mg/L for clarithromycin). Efflux-encoding mefA and mefE genes were not detectable in these isolates. The presence of 23S rRNA mutations in specific isolates did not significantly change macrolide MIC s. No nucleotide substitutions were found in genes encoding ribosomal proteins L4 or L22. The ermB and ermT genes were found in the genomes of all isolates. These two genes were acquired independently in one highly virulent isolate AL101002, and clustered with Tn916 and IS1216, respectively. The expression of both ermB and ermT in all isolates was erythromycin inducible and yielded comparable macrolide MICs in all six isolates. Taken together, inducible expression of both ermB and ermT conferred high macrolide resistance in these S. gallolyticus subsp. pasterianus isolates. Our findings reveal new macrolide resistance features in S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus by both ermB and ermT."}

In Grisel syndrome (GS), this subluxation occurs spontaneously after inflammatory processes of the head and neck. Diagnosis is typically based on clinical history and a strong suspicion of this syndrome. Nonsurgical treatment most often resolves the symptoms; however, in some cases surgical treatment is necessary to repair the subluxation. Various surgical techniques and instrumentation systems have been used to treat atlantoaxial subluxation, although there is no consensus regarding the best treatment method for the pediatric population. To describe a case of atlantoaxial subluxation in a child with GS treated surgically with an alternative construct. This is a case report and literature review. Our case study involves a 5- year -old girl with a 6- month history of unresolved Fielding type II atlantoaxial subluxation caused by GS. Despite conservative treatment, the patient's symptoms continued to progress. After two failed closed reduction attempts, open reduction and C1-C2 fusion were performed with atlas laminar hook and axis pedicle polyaxial screws. A literature review of the surgical treatment of GS was also performed. After surgery, the patient exhibited full clinical and functional recovery with complete resolution of symptoms. At the 36- month follow-up examination, there was continual evidence of satisfactory reduction and fusion. No complications were observed. Upon completion of the literature review, eight GS cases were found to have been treated surgically with the minimum patient age being 9 years. Conservative management of GS is the most common and effective treatment; however, a few surgical cases have been reported in the literature with good results. Satisfactory clinical results and fusion at 36 months post surgery were seen in a pediatric patient with atlantoaxial subluxation and instability using atlas laminar hook and axis pedicle polyaxial screws."}

Boys had 1.6 times more chance to have dental caries than girls. Dental fluorosis was found in 63.6% of children with majority of moderate degree (50.5%). Dental fluorosis status was found significantly associated with dental caries status in children. The children who had mild, moderate and severe fluorosis, had 4 times more chances to develop caries than those who did not have fluorosis. There was no significant association between children's caries status and use of paste, brushing habit, miswak, and visit to the dentist.

Here we report the results of using a recently developed proteomic approach based on the use of 3D gels to identify the endogenous SUMO targets in leaves of Solanum tuberosum. By using 3D gels we avoid the problem of co-migration of proteins, which is a major limitation of 2D gels, and we enable the use of the highly sensitive CyDye DIGE fluor saturation dyes. Using this new method we have identified 39 individual proteins as probable SUMO targets in leaves of Solanum tuberosum.

The ethical aspect of this consultation is also important. Team members must be as neutral as possible in their assessments in order to let the couple take the final decision: the continuation of the pregnancy or a request of voluntary termination of pregnancy.

Six male nurses participated in this study. The biomechanical analysis focused on the lifting strategy. Thirty obese in-patients were enrolled to take part in the experimental study and divided into three groups according to their Body Mass Index (BMI). Three-dimensional motion analysis was conducted using an optoelectronic system. The trunk kinematics and the loading on the spines of the operating nurses were computed. Our data showed that when the nurse was operating from the central handle, his trunk was more flexed at the end of the lift with a reduced range of motion. The values were higher when the nurse lifted patients with higher BMIs. All kinetic parameters and tension in the lumbar muscles at the end of the movement were characterised by lower values for the nurse placed beside the patient's head or feet if compared to the operator positioned beside the central handle in all patient groups. Our preliminary data suggest that only the reaction load on the spine of the nurse holding the central handle, closest to the patient's centre of mass, seems to exceed the recommended safety limits."}

We sought to further replicate these studies and determine if this relationship is modified by expression of p16 tumor suppressor protein. We identified 238 OPSCC cases from the Carolina Head and Neck Cancer Study (CHANCE) study, a population based case-control study. Tumors that tested positive solely for HPV16 genotype and no other genotypes with PCR were classified as HPV16-positive. Tumors positive for any other high-risk HPV genotype were classified as non-HPV16-positive. Expression of p16 in the tumor was determined with immunohistochemistry. Follow-up time was calculated from the date of diagnosis to date of death or December 31, 2013. Overall survival was compared with the Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank test. Hazard ratios (HR) adjusted for smoking, alcohol use, sex, race, and age was calculated with the Cox proportional hazard regression. Cases with HPV16-positive OPSCC had better overall survival than cases with non-HPV16-positive OPSCC (log-rank p-value: 0.010). When restricted to OPSCC cases positive for p16 expression, the same trend continued (log-rank p-value: 0.002). In the adjusted model, cases with non-HPV16-positive OPSCC had greater risk of death compared to cases with HPV16-positive tumors (HR: 1.92; 95% CI: 1.03, 3.60).

The constant use of synthetic drugs to treat this condition has led to the natural selection of resistant strains of the parasite. Hence, there is a growing focus on the potential anti-helminthic properties of medicinal plants and phytopharmaceuticals. The current study assessed the potential anti-fasciolicide action of Momordica charantia leaf extracts and fractions on the eggs of F. hepatica parasites. The lyophilized crude extract (CE) of M. charantia leaves and its sub-fractions, obtained from liquid-liquid partitioning with organic solvents, were analysed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), suspended in 1% DMSO and used in in vitro tests. Quadruplicates of 50 F. hepatica eggs were incubated at 23\u00b0C with M. charantia leaf CE in different concentrations. After 12 days no larvae were formed in eggs incubated with CE concentrations above 12.5mg/mL. Eggs incubated with CE sub-fractions at concentrations of 1000, 100, 10, 1, 0.1, 0.01\u03bcg/mL affected embryonic development, with n-butanol presenting the strongest inhibition of miracidia formation. In contrast, on the 12th day, 90% of the miracidia hatched in the control experiments using 0.03% DMSO whereas embryogenesis was completely abolished with any concentration of albendazole sulphoxide ABZ(SO). Chemical analysis of the CE and sub-fractions revealed a prominent presence of flavonoids. HPLC-MS confirmed Quercetin to be one of the main flavonoids present in the CE and the n-butanol subfraction. This is the first study to analyse the potential anti-fasciolicide action of M. charantia leaf CE and subfractions."}

It acts directly on thrombin presenting in a dynamic and predictable way, which does not require monitoring these patients. Therefore, we consider the need to assess whether their use increases the risk of bleeding involved before any dental treatment. We performed a systematic review with a bibliographic search in PubMed / Medline along with the Cochrane Library. We excluded articles dealing with all anticoagulants other than dabigatran, and works about surgical treatments in anatomical locations other than the oral cavity. We included a total of 13 papers of which 1 was a randomized clinical trial, 9 narrative literature reviews, 1 case series, 2 clinical cases and 1 expert opinion. Because we did not obtain any properly designed clinical trials, we were unable to conduct a meta-analysis. Currently, there is no consensus on the procedure to be followed in patients taking dabigatran. However, all authors agree to treat each case individually in accordance to the risk of embolism, postoperative bleeding and renal function. Also, it is necessary to perform minimally invasive interventions, and take the appropriate local anti-hemolytic measures."}

Setting: The first phase of the Fund for Innovative DOTS Expansion through Local Initiatives to Stop TB (FIDELIS) projects in China started in 2003. Objective: To determine whether the FIDELIS projects contribute d to the increased case detection rate for new smear - positive pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) in China. Methods: We compared the case notification rates (CNRs) in the intervention year with those of the previous year in the FIDELIS areas, then compared the difference between the CNRs of the intervention year and the previous year in the FIDELIS areas with those in the non-FI-DELIS areas within the province. Results: There was an increase in the CNR in the intervention year compared with the previous year for all the project sites. The differences between the CNR in the intervention year and the previous year ranged from 6.4 to 31.1 per 100 000 population in the FIDELIS areas and from 2.9 to 20.4/100 000 in the non-FIDELIS areas. Differences -in- differences analysis shows that the differences in the CNRs in the FIDELIS areas were not statistically significantly different from those in the non- FIDELIS areas (P = 0.393).

This study examined the effects of PZA exposure on zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae and the mechanisms underlying its hepatotoxicity. A transgenic line of zebrafish larvae that expressed enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in the liver was incubated with 1, 2.5, and 5 mM PZA from 72 h postfertilization (hpf). Different endpoints such as mortality, morphology changes in the size and shape of the liver, histological changes, transaminase analysis and apoptosis, markers of oxidative and genetic damage, as well as the expression of certain genes were selected to evaluate PZA - induced hepatotoxicity. Our results confirm the manner of PZA dose-dependent hepatotoxicity. PZA was found to induce marked injury in zebrafish larvae, such as liver atrophy, elevations of transaminase levels, oxidative stress, and hepatocyte apoptosis. To further understand the mechanism behind PZA - induced hepatotoxicity, changes in gene expression levels in zebrafish larvae exposed to PZA for 72 h postexposure (hpe) were determined. The results of this study demonstrated that PZA decreased the expression levels of liver fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP) and its target gene, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b1 (PPAR-\u03b1), and provoked more severe oxidative stress and hepatitis via the upregulation of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2).

Observation and psychophysical results showed that predicted preferred stimuli (both objects and nonobjects) had smooth (rather than textured) surfaces. These predictions were confirmed using fMRI, for objects and nonobjects. Similar preferences were also found in the fusiform face area (FFA). Consistent with this: (1) FFA and LO responded more strongly to nonfreckled (smooth) faces, compared with otherwise identical freckled (textured) faces; and (2) strong functional connections were found between LO and FFA.

While evidence exists for a relationship between high - fat - induced insulin resistance and metabolic disorders, there is lack of studies in relation to high-fructose diet. Therefore, we attempted to study the effect of different diets viz., high-fat diet (HFD), high-fructose diet (HFS), and a combination (HFS + HFD) diet on glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in male Wistar rats compared to control animals fed with normal pellet diet. Investigations include oral glucose tolerance test, insulin tolerance test, histopathology by H&E and Masson's trichrome staining, mRNA expression by real-time PCR, protein expression by Western blot, and caspase-3 activity by colorimetry. Rats subjected to high-fat / fructose diets became glucose intolerant, insulin-resistant, and dyslipidemic. Compared to control animals, rats subjected to different combination of fat / fructose diets showed increased mRNA and protein expression of a battery of ER stress markers both in pancreas and liver. Transcription factors of \u03b2-cell function (INSIG1, SREBP1c and PDX1) as well as hepatic gluconeogenesis (FOXO1 and PEPCK) were adversely affected in diet - induced insulin-resistant rats. The convergence of chronic ER stress towards apoptosis in pancreas / liver was also indicated by increased levels of CHOP mRNA & increased activity of both JNK and Caspase-3 in rats subjected to high-fat / fructose diets.

We describe the egg, larvae and pupae of Notofairchildia stenygros and provide nomenclatural notes on larval chaetotaxy based on analyses using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and optic microscopy. The morphology of immature Nt. stenygros is compared with other Bruchomyiinae and Psychodidae species, especially with species of Phlebotominae that are superficially similar to Bruchomyiinae. Results of this study revealed striking morphological differences between the immature stages of Bruchomyiinae and Phlebotominae; the former are lacking abdominal pseudopods and microtrichia on the cephalic integument, both of which are present in the larvae of Phlebotominae. These morphological differences observed in the immature stages between members of the two subfamilies support the findings of recent molecular studies indicating that Bruchomyiinae and Phlebtominae are evolutionarily not closely related.

We show that C-terminally truncated Red\u03b2, whilst still able to promote annealing and nucleoprotein filament formation, is unable to mediate homologous recombination. Mutations of the C-terminal domain were evaluated using both single - and double stranded (ss and ds) substrates in recombination assays. Mutations of critical amino acids affected either dsDNA recombination or both ssDNA and dsDNA recombination indicating two separable functions, one of which is critical for dsDNA recombination and the second for recombination per se. As evaluated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments, the dsDNA recombination function relates to the Red\u03b1 - Red\u03b2 protein-protein interaction, which requires not only contacts in the C-terminal domain but also a region near the N-terminus. Because the nucleoprotein filament formed with C-terminally truncated Red\u03b2 has altered properties, the second C-terminal function could be due to an interaction required for functional filaments. Alternatively the second C-terminal function could indicate a requirement for a Red\u03b2 - host factor interaction. These data further advance the model for Red recombination and the proposition that Red\u03b2 and RAD52 SSAPs share ancestral and mechanistic roots."}

The most common infection - associated findings included fever, purulent discharge from endotracheal tubes, hypotension, and neutropaenia. Infection s led to pneumonia, urinary tract infection, cellulitis and sepsis. Infection was transmitted in the intensive care unit, where 22 of 23 animals were initially hospitalised. The mortality rate was 70% (16 of 23 animals), and was higher in cases of respiratory infection compared to other infections. Aggressive environmental cleaning and disinfection, with staff education for personal hygiene and antisepsis, sharply decreased the infection incidence.

After treating the cells with the nanovector, we were able to distinguish three different cell populations from different cell lines (cancer HeLa and PC-3, and normal HaCaT lines), suitably chosen for their different expressions of folate binding proteins. The nanovector, indeed, binds much more efficiently on cancer cell lines than on normal ones, resulting in a higher SERS signal measured on cancer cells.

To add detail to the rates and circumstances surrounding occupational injury among meatpacking workers, we conducted a cross-sectional study of workers employed at an industrial beefpacking plant in Nebraska, United States (n = 137) and interviewed workers about recent injury experiences. We assessed frequency, cause and nature of self-reported injury. We estimated annual incidence rates of self-reported injuries using the OSHA formula and compared these rates to industry-wide data. We also evaluated psychological distress in this workforce as measured by the Kessler-6 scale to assess whether distress was associated with recent occupational injury. In this study, 15.1% of workers experienced occupational injuries that required time off work, job transfer, or restriction during the past three months. The estimated annual incidence rate was 15.2 injuries per 100 full-time workers for these injuries at this plant. Rushing was identified as the cause of nearly 50% of injuries, and repetitive work as the cause of an additional 20% of injuries. Use of metal mesh sleeves (POR: 0.10 (p = 0.008)) and metal mesh gloves (POR: 0.41 (p = 0.05) were associated with reduced risk of injury.

After 25 days of incubation, the strain JPM1 could degrade 91.78 % of the initial amount of fluoranthene. Moreover, four metabolites 9-fluorenone-1-carboxylic acid, 9-fluorenone, phthalic acid, and benzoic acid were detected in the culture solution. The gene sequence encoding the aromatic-ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase was amplified in the strain JPM1 by PCR. Based on the translated protein sequence, a homology modeling method was applied to build the crystal structure of dioxygenase. Subsequently, the interaction mechanism between fluoranthene and the active site of dioxygenase was simulated and analyzed by molecular docking. Consequently, a feasible degrading pathway of fluoranthene in the strain JPM1 was proposed based on the metabolites and the interaction analyses. Additionally, the thermodynamic analysis showed that the strain JPM1 had high tolerance for fluoranthene, and the influence of fluoranthene for the bacterial growth activity was negligible under 100 to 400 mg L(-1) concentrations.

Here, we explored the effects of NDV - infected MSCs derived from different sources, on glioma cells and glioma stem cells (GSCs) and the mechanisms involved in their effects. The glioma cell lines (A172 and U87) and primary GSCs that were generated from GBM tumors were used in this study. MSCs derived from bone marrow, adipose tissue or umbilical cord were infected with NDV (MTH-68/H). The ability of these cells to deliver the virus to glioma cell lines and GSCs and the effects of NDV - infected MSCs on cell death and on the stemness and self-renewal of GSCs were examined. The mechanisms involved in the cytotoxic effects of the NDV - infected MSCs and their influence on the radiation sensitivity of GSCs were examined as well. NDV induced a dose-dependent cell death in glioma cells and a low level of apoptosis and inhibition of self-renewal in GSCs. MSCs derived from bone marrow, adipose and umbilical cord that were infected with NDV delivered the virus to co-cultured glioma cells and GSCs. Conditioned medium of NDV - infected MSCs induced higher level of apoptosis in the tumor cells compared with the apoptosis induced by their direct infection with similar virus titers. These results suggest that factor(s) secreted by the infected MSCs sensitized the glioma cells to the cytotoxic effects of NDV.

We focused on five criteria (habitat quality, landscape heterogeneity, climate, management and health), as well as 30 subcriteria, and we used the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to rank them according to relevance. Habitat quality proved to have the highest relevance, followed by beehive management. Within habitat quality, the following subcriteria proved to be most relevant: orographic diversity, elevation range and important plant species located 1.5 km from the apiary. The most important subcriteria under beehive management were honey production, movement of the apiary to a location with a higher altitude and wax renewal. Temperature was the most important subcriterion under climate, while pathogen and Varroa loads were the most significant under health. Two of the six apiaries showed the best values in the AHP analysis and showed annual honey production of 70 and 28 kg/ colony. This high productivity was due primarily to high elevation range and high orographic diversity, which favored high habitat quality. In addition, one of these apiaries showed the best value for beehive management, while the other showed the best value for health, reflected in the low pathogen load and low average number of viruses. These results highlight the importance of environmental factors and good sanitary practices to maximize apiary health and honey productivity."}

A total of three primary histological varieties have been identified: conventional, chondroid, and dedifferentiated. We report a case of an 8-year-old white girl who presented with conventional chordoma, was treated with surgical resection and mixed proton and photon beam therapy, and had a recurrence in the resection cavity 2.5 years later with dedifferentiated morphology. The recurrent tumor did not express brachyury, a recently identified protein specific to tissue of notochordal origin. The short time period between radiation therapy and dedifferentiation, low dose of photons, and rarity of dedifferentiated skull base chordomas in pediatric patients should alert clinicians to the possibility of chordoma dedifferentiation after proton beam therapy."}

Dried blood spot (DBS) sampling and blood collection with heparinized capillaries are the standard techniques. Volumetric absorptive microsampling (VAMS) is a novel technique that collects a fixed volume of blood by applying an absorbent tip to a blood drop. In the present study we explored the feasibility of HbA1c monitoring with VAMS sampling at home and analysis in the laboratory. Diabetic patients were enrolled in this study during consultation with the endocrinologist. A venous (adults) or capillary (children) sample was taken for immediate HbA1c analysis. DBS (n=1) and dried VAMS (n=2) were collected at home and sent to the laboratory. For 25 pediatric patients one VAMS was collected during consultation for immediate analysis (without drying), referred to as \" wet VAMS \". HbA1c analyses were performed on a Tosoh HLC-723 G8 high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyzer. The median time between sampling at home and analysis was 3 days. Results of HbA1c in dried VAMS showed a poor agreement with venous / capillary blood collected in hospital (concordance correlation coefficient CCC =0.72). Similar observations were found with standard DBS. An excellent agreement was obtained between HbA1c results on wet VAMS (CCC =0.996) and standard blood samples. Patients experienced VAMS and DBS as easy and convenient to use. Utilizing equipment standard available in the clinical laboratory, the use of home -sampled dried VAMS and DBS is not a reliable tool for the monitoring of HbA1c. However, perfect agreement between HbA1c measured on wet VAMS and capillary microsamples was obtained."}

What Eye Wrinkles Reveal about a Horse's Emotional State Finding valid indicators of emotional states is one of the biggest challenges in animal welfare science. Here, we investigated in horses whether variation in the expression of eye wrinkles caused by contraction of the inner eyebrow raiser reflects emotional valence. By confronting horses with positive and negative conditions, we aimed to induce positive and negative emotional states, hypothesising that positive emotions would reduce whereas negative emotions would increase eye wrinkle expression. Sixteen horses were individually exposed in a balanced order to two positive (grooming, food anticipation) and two negative condition s (food competition, waving a plastic bag). Each condition lasted for 60 seconds and was preceded by a 60 second control phase. Throughout both phases, pictures of the eyes were taken, and for each horse four pictures per condition and phase were randomly selected. Pictures were scored in random order and by two experimenters blind to condition and phase for six outcome measures: qualitative impression, eyelid shape, markedness of the wrinkles, presence of eye white, number of wrinkles, and the angle between the line through the eyeball and the highest wrinkle. The angle decreased during grooming and increased during food competition compared to control phase s, whereas the two phases did not differ during food anticipation and the plastic bag condition. No effects on the other outcome measures were detected. Taken together, we have defined a set of measures to assess eye wrinkle expression reliably, of which one measure was affected by the conditions the horses were exposed to. Variation in eye wrinkle expression might provide valuable information on horse welfare but further validation of specific measures across different conditions is needed."}

The biomass removed 99.4% of mercury, following a pseudo-second order kinetics (r(2) = 0.9999). The Langmuir model was adequately fitted to the adsorption isotherm, thereby obtaining the maximum mercury adsorption capacity of 111.1 \u00b1 0.3 mg g(-1). The biomass showed high density of strong mercury chelating groups, thus making it economically attractive. Also, the implementation of a mercury - selective electrode for continuous determination in real time is proposed; this electrode replaces techniques like atomic absorption spectroscopy, thus it can be applied to real time studies. This work therefore presents a new perspective for removing mercury(II) from contaminated water for environmental remediation."}

To balance nurse workloads, direct patient care activities, indirect patient care activities, and non-patient care activities that occur throughout a shift must be considered. The layout of a hospital unit and the location of a nurse's assigned patients relative to other resources on the unit are also important factors in achieving workload balance. In most hospitals, a unit charge nurse is responsible for the shift assignment of patients to nurses based on experience and past practices. The nurse-patient assignment process is also often a manual process in which the charge nurse must sort through multiple decision criteria in a limited amount of time. In this paper, a methodology for the construction of balanced nurse-patient workload assignments is proposed. Through the illustration of this methodology new scoring metrics are developed using measures currently available on, or from, the hospital unit. It was demonstrated that the complex scheduling problem can be captured. While the methodology was illustrated for a scheduling problem commonly encountered on a hospital unit, the approach can be adapted to other workforce scheduling problems in which measures of workload are required and composed of elements imposed by the work environment, variability within the required tasks, and a measurable perception of the relative intensity of the work elements."}

The protein expression levels of FSHR, IGF-1, and BAX were measured using Western blot analysis. The results of the present work revealed that in vitro addition of ALA - induced significant increase in the growth and development of secondary preantral follicles throughout the culture period as compared to control. The FSHR, IGF-1, luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor, bone morphogenetic protein receptor type IA, transforming growth factor beta receptor 1, growth differentiation factor 9, and Activin A genes were upregulated in ALA - treated follicles as compared to the control. On contrary, preapoptotic genes BAX and C-Myc were downregulated in treated follicles compared to control ones. The protein levels of FSHR and IGF-1 were highly expressed in treated follicles compared to control; however, BAX protein was downregulated in the treated follicles groups.

While some tools have been developed to estimate an individual's cognitive reserve (CR), no study has assessed the adequacy of the method used for assessing these CR proxy indicators. Therefore, we aimed to determine the most appropriate method to estimate CR by comparing two approaches: (1) the common assessment of CR proxies in the literature (e.g. years of education) and (2) the calculation of a comprehensive index based on most significant parameters used in the estimation of CR. Data on CR proxies (i.e. education, occupation, and leisure activities) were obtained in a sample of 204 older adults. Regression analyses were used to develop the two indices of CR (i.e. ICR-standard and ICR-detailed) and to determine which index best represented the level of one's CR. The ICR-standard was calculated using a combination of the three most common measures of reserve in the literature: number of schooling years, complexity of the primary occupation, and amount of current participation in stimulating activities. The ICR-detailed was calculated using the most significant parameters (established in initial analyses) of CR: highest level of education combined with the number of training courses, last occupation, and amount of current participation in social and intellectual activities. The comparison of both indices showed that higher levels of ICR-standard and ICR-detailed were associated with a greater minimization of the effects of age on cognition. However, the ICR-detailed was more strongly associated to this minimization than the ICR-standard, suggesting that the ICR-detailed best reflect one's CR. This study is the first to show that it is of great importance to question methods measuring CR proxies in order to develop a clinical tool allowing a comprehensive and accurate estimation of CR."}

In randomized clinical trials the variability in pathology report after central pathology review is noteworthy. We evaluated the discordance rate (DR) and inter-rater agreement between local and central histopathological report and the clinical implication on treatment decision. A retrospective analysis was conducted in a series of consecutive early breast cancer tumors diagnosed by local pathologists and subsequently reviewed at the Pathology Division of European Institute of Oncology. The inter-rater agreement (k) between local and central pathology was calculated for Ki-67, grading, hormone receptors (ER / PgR) and HER2/neu. The Bland-Altman plots were derived to determine discrepancies in Ki-67, ER and PgR. DR was calculated for ER / PgR and HER2. From 2007 to 2013, 187 pathology specimens from 10 Cancer Centers were reviewed. Substantial agreement was observed for ER (k0.612; 95% CI, 0538-0.686), PgR (k0.659; 95% CI, 0580-0.737), Ki-67 (k0.609; 95% CI, 0.534-0.684) and grading (k0.669; 95% CI, 0.569-0.769).

NIPD avoids the risks associated with invasive testing, making prenatal diagnosis more accessible to families at high genetic risk. However, the challenge remains in offering definitive diagnosis for autosomal recessive diseases, which is complicated by the predominance of the maternal mutant allele in the cell-free DNA sample and thus requires a variety of different approaches. Validation and diagnostic implementation for NIPD of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is further complicated by presence of a pseudogene that requires a different approach. We have used an assay targeting approximately 6700 heterozygous SNPs around the CAH gene (CYP21A2) to construct the high-risk parental haplotypes and tested this approach in five cases, showing that inheritance of the parental alleles can be correctly identified using NIPD. We are evaluating various measures of the fetal fraction to help determine inheritance of parental mutations. We are currently exploring the utility of an NIPD multi-disorder panel for autosomal recessive disease, to make testing more widely applicable to families with a variety of serious genetic conditions."}

Hemostatic devices delivering blood clotting accelerating agents such as fibrinogen are increasingly used due to their efficacy and their ease of application. In the present study, we describe a method to incorporate the coagulant supplements fibrinogen and thrombin in silk protein sponges by mixing the coagulants with an aqueous silk solution, followed by molding, freeze-drying and water annealing. In this combination system we demonstrate the delivery of fibrinogen while maintaining its hemostatic potential. Concentration ratios of silk to fibrinogen of 1.0%/2.8%, 2.3%/1.5% and 3.0%/0.8% were used. The thrombin -induced fibrin polymeric network filled the space in and next to the silk spongy structure but also remained interconnected to the silk, providing an intact network. The mechanical characterization of the fibrinogen-releasing silk sponges before and after the induction of the fibrinogen polymerization demonstrated that the fibrin network resulted in reduced permanent deformation from 21.1% to 6.5%, 19.6% to 5.7% and 12.7% to 9.4% for the 2.8%, 1.5% and 0.8% fibrinogen -containing silk sponges, respectively. Moreover, the fibrin formation lead to a more linear elastic behavior over longer strain ranges. In combination, the Calcein-AM / PI stainings and MTT assay results indicate uniform cell adhesion on the surface and cytocompatibility of the silk / fibrin sponges, respectively. Moreover, the co-delivery of thrombin with fibrinogen via silk as carrier material is described, offering a more mechanically robust and durable system while preserving hemostatic features of the coagulant substances for the generation of hemostatic devices.

The optimal strategies for NK cell activation prior to infusion are still under debate. There is recent evidence that NK cells can acquire long-term functional competence by preactivation with the cytokines IL-12 / 15 / 18. The mechanisms supporting the maintenance of long-term NK cell antitumor activity are incompletely under-stood. Here, we show that NK cells preactivated in vitro with IL-12 / 15 / 18, but not with IL-15 alone, maintained high antitumor activity even 1 mo after transfer into lymphopenic RAG-2(-/-) \u03b3c(-/-) mice. The NK cell intrinsic ability for IFN\u03b3 production coincided with demethylation of the conserved non-coding sequence (CNS) 1 in the Ifng locus, previously shown to enhance transcription of Ifng. In a xenograft melanoma mouse model, human IL-12 / 15 / 18 -preactivated NK cells rejected tumors more efficiently. In RAG-2(-/-) \u03b3c(-/-) mice, co-transfer of CD4(+) T cells further improved the long-term competence of NK cells for IFN\u03b3 production that was dependent on IL-2. CD4(+) T cell activation during homeostatic proliferation required macrophages and further promoted the long-term NK cell antitumor activity. Thus, NK cells can \"remember\" a previous exposure to cytokines by epigenetic imprinting resulting in a remarkable stability of the IFN\u03b3 -producing phenotype after adoptive transfer. In addition, our results support combination of cytokine -preactivated NK cells with CD4(+) T cell activation upon lymphopenic conditioning to achieve long-term NK cell effector function for cancer immunotherapy."}

Overwhelming similarities between the urban and rural institutions were found with NICU nurses expressing understanding of the indications for initiating TH, agreement that TH improves long-term outcomes and that the benefits of TH outweigh the risks. Nurses at the urban institution more frequently expressed concerns surrounding inadequate treatment of baby pain / sedation, and nurses at both institutions strongly emphasized the need for more nurse and parent education about TH and improved timeliness of decision making for initiation of TH.

To complement standard search engines such as PubMed, it is desirable to have an advanced search tool that directly returns relevant biomedical entities such as targets, drugs, and mutations rather than a long list of articles. Some existing tools submit a query to PubMed and process retrieved abstracts to extract information at query time, resulting in a slow response time and limited coverage of only a fraction of the PubMed corpus. Other tools preprocess the PubMed corpus to speed up the response time; however, they are not constantly updated, and thus produce outdated results. Further, most existing tools cannot process sophisticated queries such as searches for mutations that co-occur with query terms in the literature. To address these problems, we introduce BEST, a biomedical entity search tool. BEST returns, as a result, a list of 10 different types of biomedical entities including genes, diseases, drugs, targets, transcription factors, miRNAs, and mutations that are relevant to a user's query.

Peak ankle power generation at push-off (peakA2), peak hip power generation in early swing (peakH3) and propulsion strategy (PS) [peakA2 / (peakA2+peakH3)] were calculated to provide the relative contribution of ankle power to total propulsion. Mean PS values decreased as speed increased for comfortable walking (p<0.001), fast walking (p<0.001) and fast running (p<0.001), and less consistently during jogging (p=0.054). PS varied with age (p<0.001) only during fast walking. At any speed of fast walking, older children generated more peakA2 (p=0.001) and less peakH3 (p=0.001) than younger children.

The OBD group consisted of 45 youth, 24 of whom had current psychiatric symptoms (OBD(+)s) and 21 without any psychiatric symptoms (OBD(-)s), and were compared with 24 HC youth. Temperament characteristics were measured by using the Revised Dimensions of Temperament Survey. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure hippocampal volumes. The association between temperament and hippocampal volumes was tested by using multiple regression analysis. Compared with the OBD(-)s group, the OBD(+)s group had significantly more inhibited temperament traits, less flexibility, more negative mood, and less regular rhythm in their daily routines. In contrast, the OBD(-)s group was more likely to approach novel situations compared with OBD(+)s or HC groups. Within the OBD(+)s group, a more inhibited temperament was associated with smaller right hippocampal volumes. In this study, symptomatic OBD were characterized by an inhibited temperament that was inversely correlated with hippocampal volume. Additional longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether inverse correlations between hippocampal volume and inhibited temperament represent early markers of risk for later developing bipolar disorder."}

Previous single molecule force spectroscopy studies demonstrated stretched exponential kinetics of protein unfolding under a constant pulling force, the molecular origin of which remains subject to debate. We here set out to extensively sample the mechanical unfolding of ubiquitin and NuG2 by Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. Both proteins show kinetics best fit by stretched exponentials, with stretching exponents similar to those found in experiments, even though static disorder is absent in our short MD simulations. Instead, we can ascribe non-exponential kinetics to dynamic disorder, due to conformational fluctuations on the nanosecond timescale. Our study highlights the general role of dynamic disorder in protein kinetics on a broad range of time scales even including those probed in MD simulations."}

It possesses a large genome and a robust ability to express exogenous genes. Thus, this virus is an ideal vector for recombinant live vaccines for infectious diseases in ruminant animals. In this study, we identified a novel bidirectional promoter region of GTPV through screening named PbVV(\u00b1). PbVV(\u00b1) is located between ETF-l and VITF-3, which are transcribed in opposite directions. A new recombinant goat pox virus (rGTPV) was constructed, in which duplicate PbVV(+) was used as a promoter element to enhance Brucella OMP31 expression, and duplicate PbVV (-) was used as a promoter element to regulate enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) at the same time as the selection marker. PbVV(-) promoter activity was compared to that of the P7.5 promoter of vaccinia virus, as measured by EGFP expression; the fluorescence intensity of EGFP expressed in cells was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. PbVV(+) promoter activity was measured by Brucella OMP31 expression. Interaction with the anti-Brucella-OMP31 monoclonal antibody was confirmed by western blotting, and OMP31 mRNA expression was assessed by qRT-PCR. The results of this study will be useful for the further study of effective multivalent vaccines based on rGTPV. This study also provides a theoretical basis for overcoming the problem of low expression of exogenous genes."}

A prospective cohort of patients implanted with an ICD (n=1531; 80.4% men) completed the PHQ-9 at the time of implant. Data were analyzed using two item response theory models, the partial credit model and the generalized partial credit model. The analysis showed disordered response thresholds in eight of nine items for the partial credit model and five of nine items for the generalized partial credit model, indicating that respondents have difficulty discriminating between response options. When collapsing response options 2 and 3, the rescored PHQ-9 had a better fit to both models. The unidimensionality and the precision of the rescored PHQ-9 were confirmed. Items did not have any differential functioning (DIF) across educational level, age, indication for ICD implantation, and severity of heart failure that influence depression outcomes in patients with an ICD. One item exhibited DIF by gender. Three items did not fit the partial credit model, but the generalized partial credit model could be fitted to the full item set. The unidimensionality and reliability of the Danish version of the PHQ-9 were confirmed.

This observational study analysed data from French administrative databases for more than 30,000 patients with HCC diagnosed between 2009 and 2012, and followed-up until 2013. The incidence of HCC, access to surgery, and survival, at both the national level and two geographical levels (the 21 French regions and 95 French departments into which France is divided administratively), were determined. The influence on outcome of the structure of the hospital where HCC was first managed was assessed. At the national level, the median survival was 9.4 months and only 22.8% of patients had curative treatment. There were marked variations between regions and departments in incidence, access to curative treatment (range 1.3-28.8% and 8.1-32.3% respectively), and in median survival (range 5.7-12.1 and 4.3-16.5 months respectively). The administrative type and annual HCC - caseload of the hospital where patients were first admitted also had an independent influence on treatment and survival. Despite full insurance coverage for all citizens, national measures to reduce inequities in the management of cancer patients, standardised recommendations for HCC surveillance and management, the percentage of patients undergoing curative treatment and their survival may vary four-fold depending on their postcode. The hospital in which patients are first managed has a clear influence on accessibility to both good care and survival. Population-based studies have highlighted large and sometimes unexpected differences between countries in the survival of patients with malignancy. As these differences are considered to indicate the overall effectiveness of health systems, in addition to the incidence of the cancer or quality of registration, variations within a given country should be minimal. However, similar to between countries differences, this study shows differences within the same country in the incidence, curative treatment rate, and survival of patients with HCC. Evidence that access to care and survival varies within a country can strengthen the impetus for government and clinicians to address these disparities."}

Identification of predictive markers of chemoresistance is beneficial to selecting of the best therapeutic protocol with the lowest effect adverse. Hence, we aimed to find drug targets using the 2DE / MS proteomics study of a DEXA - resistant cell line (REH) as a model for poor DEXA responding patients before and after drug treatment. Using the proteomic methods, three differentially expressed proteins were detected, including voltage dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1), sorting Nexin 3 (SNX3), and prefoldin subunit 6 (PFDN6). We observed low expression of three proteins after DEXA treatment in REH cells. We subsequently verified low expression of resulted proteins at the mRNA level using the quantitative PCR method. These proteins are promising proteins because of their important roles in drug resistance and regulation of apoptosis (VDAC1), protein trafficking (SNX3), and protein folding (PFDN6). Additionally, mRNA expression level of these proteins was assessed in 17 bone marrow samples from children with newly diagnosed ALL and 7 non-cancerous samples as controls. The results indicated that independent of the molecular subtypes of leukemia, mRNA expression of VDAC1, SNX3, and PFDN6 decreased in ALL samples compared with non-cancerous samples particularly in VDAC1 (p < 0.001). Additionally, mRNA expression of three proteins was also declined in high-risk samples compared with standard risk cases. These results demonstrated diagnostic and prognostic value of these proteins in childhood ALL.

The authors used an equilibrium partitioning (EqP) approach to generate predicted PCB sediment effect concentrations (largely Aroclor 1254) associated with a gradient of toxic effects in benthic organisms from effects observed in aquatic toxicity studies. The present study differs from all other EqP collective sediment investigations in that the authors examined a common dose-response gradient of effects for PCBs rather than a single, protective value. The authors reviewed the chronic aquatic toxicity literature to identify measured aqueous PCB concentrations and associated benthic invertebrate effects. The authors control-normalized the aquatic toxic effect data and expressed results from various studies as a common metric, percent injury. Then, they calculated organic carbon -normalized sediment PCB concentrations (mg/kg organic carbon) from the aqueous PCB toxicity data set using EqP theory based on the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPIWEB 4.1) derivation of the water-organic carbon partition coefficient (KOC). Lastly, the authors constructed a nonlinear dose-response numerical model for these synoptic sediment PCB concentrations and biological effects: Y = 100/1 + 10(([logEC50-logX] \u00d7 [Hill slope])) (EC50 = median effective concentration). These models were used to generate \"look-up\" tables reporting percent injury in benthic biota for a range of Aroclor -specific sediment concentrations. For example, the model using the EPIWEB KOC estimate predicts mean benthic injury of 23.3%, 46.0%, 70.6%, 87.1%, and 95% for hypothetical sediment concentrations of 1 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg, 4 mg/kg, 8 mg/kg, and 16 mg/kg dry weight of Aroclor 1254, respectively (at 1% organic carbon). The authors recommend the model presented for screening but suggest, when possible, determining a site-specific KOC that, along with the tables and equations, allows users to create their own protective dose-response sediment concentration.

During such a process, hematogenous metastasis is an indispensable approach for the dissemination of cancer cells. A platelet, contributes to hypercoagulable state, and is also identified the crucial factor in the coagulation system for supporting metastasis. Therefore, the relationship of a platelet and a tumor cell plays a critical role in tumor cell metastasis. Consequently, inhibiting tumor cell \u2011induced platelet aggregation (TCIPA) is recongnized as a crucial target on suppression of tumor metastasis such as aspirin (ASA). Under such circumstance, here we report that, through dissociating the tumor\u2011platelet (T\u2011P) complex, 80% ethanol extracts of Caulis Spatholobi (SET) successfully alleviated the hypercoagulation state, thereby reducing tumor metastasis and improving the prospects of survival in breast cancer cell model. Through MTT and anti\u2011aggregation assay stimulated by ADP, we detected the optimum treatment time and the optimum dose of SET. By using confocal microscopy, we observed that SET can strongly block the formation of T\u2011P complex i n vitro. The result was further quantified and confirmed by the FACS analysis. The fluorescent value of T\u2011P complex was obviously decreased in the drug\u2011treated groups. In vivo, 4T1 cells were injected through the mouse tail vein for dynamic visualization by small animal imaging system. The metastatic intensity was quantified and the survival curve was analyzed.

SET exerted an obvious effect on the inhibition of metastasis and increasing the survival rate of mice.

Through routine diagnostics, we identified 3 novel individuals with the seemingly uncommon combination of 22q11DS and JME. We subsequently screened the literature for reports focussing on the epilepsy phenotype in 22q11DS. We additionally screened a database of 173 22q11DS patients and identified a fourth individual with JME as well as 2 additional cases with GGE. We describe 6 novel and 22 published cases with co-occurrence of 22q11DS and GGE. In many patients, GGE was associated with myoclonic seizures allowing for a diagnosis of JME in at least 6 individuals. Seventeen of the 173 22q11DS cases (10%) had a diagnosis of either focal or generalized epilepsy. In these cases, focal epilepsy could often be attributed to syndrome-associated hypocalcaemia, cerebral bleeds, or structural brain anomalies. However, the cause of GGE remained unclear. In this study, we describe and review 28 individuals with 22q11DS and GGE (especially JME), showing that both disorders frequently co-occur. Compared to the reported prevalence of 15-21%, in our case series only 10% of 22q11DS individuals were found to have epilepsy, often GGE. Since 22q11.2 does not contain convincing GGE candidate genes, we discuss the possibility of an aetiological correlation through a possibly disturbed interaction with the GABAB receptor."}

Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is released from urinary bladder cells and acts as a smooth muscle contraction and sensory signal in micturition but little is known about the role of ATP release in the pathophysiology of overactive bladder. To assess the relationship between ATP and overactive bladder, we used a partial bladder outlet obstruction (pBOO) model in rats. The bladder caused several changes by pBOO: An increase in bladder weight, hypertrophy of sub-urothelium and sub-serosal area, and frequent non - voiding bladder contraction during urine storage. Basal ATP release from urothelium and serosa of pBOO rats was significantly higher than that of normal rats. Distention induced ATP release from urothelium of normal and pBOO rats had no significant change. However, distention - induced ATP release from serosa of pBOO rats was higher than that of normal.

Determining which insect species are vectors of a given phytoplasma is important for managing disease but is methodologically challenging because disease-free plants need to be exposed to large numbers of insects, often over many months. A relatively new method to detect likely transmission involves molecular testing for phytoplasma DNA in sucrose solution that insects have fed upon. In this study we combined this feeding medium method with a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay to study 627 insect specimens of 11 Hemiptera taxa sampled from sites in Papua New Guinea affected by Bogia coconut syndrome (BCS). The LAMP assay detected phytoplasma DNA from the feeding solution and head tissue of insects from six taxa belonging to four families: Derbidae, Lophopidae, Flatidae and Ricaniidae. Two other taxa yielded positives only from the heads and the remainder tested negative. These results demonstrate the utility of combining single-insect feeding medium tests with LAMP assays to identify putative vectors that can be the subject of transmission tests and to better understand phytoplasma pathosystems."}

Spontaneous pretend play is often impacted in atypical development, notably in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Since ASD traits exist along a continuum in the general population, investigating how pretend play varies across the range of ASD symptoms by indexing variations in ASD traits in both typically developing and ASD populations may provide insight into how ASD symptoms may influence the relation between pretend play and associated processes in cognitive development. This study used rigorous observational methods to assess spontaneous pretend play. Specifically, 5- min free-play sessions with two discrete toy sets were double-coded by blinded coders (coder assignment counterbalanced). Key facets of pretense development [attribution of pretend properties (APP), object substitution (OS), imaginary objects] were examined. These facets of pretend play production were then analyzed in relation to ASD symptoms, as well as plausible, long-theorized correlates [theory of mind (ToM), verbal ability, familiarity, and interest in specific toys]. Forty children (Mage = 6;5, SDage = 1.45; 29 males), six of whom met the threshold for ASD diagnosis via parent -reported ASD symptoms, participated in play sessions and completed measures of verbal IQ and ToM. Besides the measure of child ASD symptoms, parents completed a survey of their child's interest in and familiarity with the play session toys. Overall, greater ToM predicted more APP, and more interest in the toys presented predicted more OS. In terms of overall pretend play production, two results were counterintuitive. First, among children with more ASD symptoms, verbal ability marginally negatively predicted pretend play production. Second, among children with fewer ASD symptoms, ToM negatively predicted pretend play production. Further probing revealed that the negative effect of ASD symptoms on pretend play was simultaneously moderated by both variables: low ToM and high verbal ability both related to less pretend play production among children with more ASD symptoms.

Currently, 30 BPH - resistance genes have been genetically defined, most of which are clustered on specific chromosome regions. Here, we describe molecular cloning and characterization of a BPH - resistance gene, BPH9, mapped on the long arm of rice chromosome 12 (12L). BPH9 encodes a rare type of nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat (NLR)-containing protein that localizes to the endomembrane system and causes a cell death phenotype. BPH9 activates salicylic acid - and jasmonic acid - signaling pathways in rice plants and confers both antixenosis and antibiosis to BPH. We further demonstrated that the eight BPH - resistance genes that are clustered on chromosome 12L, including the widely used BPH1, are allelic with each other. To honor the priority in the literature, we thus designated this locus as BPH1/9 These eight genes can be classified into four allelotypes, BPH1/9-1, -2, -7, and -9 These allelotypes confer varying levels of resistance to different biotypes of BPH. The coding region of BPH1/9 shows a high level of diversity in rice germplasm. Homologous fragments of the nucleotide-binding (NB) and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains exist, which might have served as a repository for generating allele diversity.

Pam3CSK4, a triacylated lipoprotein, is anchored to the extracellular domain of TLR1 and TLR2 and induces pro-inflammatory signals. Here we show that C4b binding protein (C4BP), which is a complement pathway inhibitor, is a TLR2 -associated molecule. Immunoprecipitation assay using anti-TLR2 mAb shows that C4BP binds to TLR2. In C4BP-deficient mice, Pam3CSK4 - induced IL-6 levels were increased compared with wild type mice. In C4BP - expressing cells, Pam3CSK4 - induced IL-8 production was reduced depending on the C4BP expression levels. These results reveal the important role of C4BP in negative regulation of TLR1 / 2 - dependent pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Furthermore, using a fluorescent conjugated Pam3CSK4, we show that C4BP blocks the binding of Pam3CSK4 to TLR1 / 2. Finally, we show that exogenous C4BP also inhibits Pam3CSK4 - induced signaling leading to IL-8 production. Our results indicate C4BP binding to TLR2 and consequent neutralization of its activity otherwise inducing pro-inflammatory cytokine production. C4BP is a negative regulator of TLR1 / 2 activity."}

The guinea pigs were randomly divided into 4 groups, such as control group, gall-stone (GS) group, emodin group and ursodeoxycholic acid (UA) group. Cholesterol calculus models were induced in guinea pigs of GS, emodin and UA groups by lithogenic diet, while emodin or UA were given to the corresponding group for 7 weeks. The histomorphological and ultrastructure change of gallbladder were detected by microscope and electron microscope, the content of plasma cholecystokinin (CCK) and [Ca(2+)]i were analyzed successively by radioimmunoassay and flow cytometry. The protein and mRNA of Gs\u03b1, Gi\u03b1 and Cap in cholecyst cells were determined by western blotting and real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Emodin or UA can relieve pathogenic changes in epithelial cells and muscle cells in gallbladder of guinea pig with cholesterol calculus by microscope and transmission electron microscope. In the cholecyst cells of GS group, CCK levels in plasma and [Ca(2+)]i decreased, the protein and mRNA of GS were down-regulated, the protein and mRNA of Gi and Cap were up-regulated. Emodin significantly decreased the formative rate of gallstone, improved the pathogenic change in epithelial cells and muscle cells, increased CCK levels in plasma and [Ca(2+)]i in cholecyst cells, enhanced the protein and mRNA of Gs in cholecyst cells, reduced the protein and mRNA of Gi and Cap in cholecyst cells in guinea pig with cholesterol calculus.

Gas chromatography (GC) has been widely used to separate OH-PAHs before quantification by mass spectrometry in biomonitoring studies. However, because GC requires derivatization, it can be time consuming. We developed an on-line solid phase extraction coupled to isotope dilution - high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (on-line-SPE - HPLC-MS / MS) method for the quantification in urine of 1-OH-naphthalene, 2-OH-naphthalene, 2-OH-fluorene, 3-OH-fluorene, 1-OH-phenanthrene, the sum of 2-OH and 3-OH-phenanthrene, 4-OH-phenanthrene, and 1-OH-pyrene. The method, which employed a 96- well plate platform and on-line SPE, showed good sensitivity (i.e., limits of detection ranged from 0.007 to 0.09 ng/mL) and used only 100 \u03bcL of urine. Accuracy, calculated from the recovery percentage at three spiking levels, varied from 94 to 113 %, depending on the analyte. The inter - and intra - day precision, calculated from 20 repeated measurements of two quality control materials, varied from 5.2 to 16.7 %. Adequate method performance was also confirmed by acceptable recovery (83-102 %) of two NIST standard reference materials (3672 and 3673).

The aim of the present study was to examine the utility and applicability of the \"Childhood Obesity Risk Evaluation (CORE)\" index as a screening tool for the early prediction of obesity in childhood and adolescence. Anthropometric, socio-demographic data were collected cross-sectionally and retrospectively from a representative sample of 5946 children, and adolescents and were combined for calculating the CORE-index score. Logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the associations of the CORE-index score with obesity by gender and age group, and cut-off point analysis was also applied to identify the optimal value of the CORE-index score that differentiates obese from non-obese children. Mean CORE-index score in the total sample was 3.06 (sd 1.92) units (range 0-11 units). Each unit increase in the CORE-index score was found to be associated with a 30 % (95 % C.I. 1.24-1.36) increased likelihood for obesity in childhood or adolescence, while the optimal cut-off value of the CORE-index score that predicted obesity with the highest possible sensitivity and specificity was found to be 3.5. The present study supports the utility and applicability of the CORE-index as a screening tool for the early identification of infants that are potentially at a higher risk for becoming obese at their childhood and adolescence.

Myocardial ischemia is the most common cause of death globally. Heart ischemic preconditioning (IPC) has a protective effect against myocardial cell death induced by ischemia and ischemia-reperfusion injury. WDR26 has recently been identified as a protein that is increased following rat cardiac IPC. WDR26 can promote the proliferation of H9c2 cells and protect cardiomyocytes against oxidative stress through inhibiting apoptosis. However, its role in myocardial ischemia is unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the role of WDR26 in myocardial ischemia and H9c2 cell hypoxia. Our results showed that WDR26 is induced by myocardial ischemia and H9c2 cell hypoxia. WDR26 protects H9c2 cells against hypoxia injury through inhibiting LDH release and increasing cell viability. WDR26 promotes hypoxia - induced autophagy in hypoxia of H9c2 cells. We further demonstrated that in H9c2 cell hypoxia, WDR26 increases mitochondrial membrane potential, thereby increases Parkin translocation of mitochondria. After Parkin is translocated at mitochondria, WDR26 can increase mitochondria l protein ubiquitination in hypoxia of H9c2 cells. WDR26 is a mediator of response to hypoxia, and WDR26 plays an important role in hypoxia -mediated autophagy and mitophagy. This study provides novel insights into the protective role of WDR26 in cardiomyocyte injury during hypoxia. WDR26 may serve as a potential target for the treatment of myocardial ischemia."}

We carried out a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of a cohort of hospitalized adults with CAPP. Pneumococcal aetiology was established in patients with one or more positive cultures for Streptococcus pneumoniae obtained from blood, sterile fluids or sputum, and/or a positive urinary antigen test. De-escalation therapy was considered when the initial antibiotic therapy was narrowed to penicillin, amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate within the first 72 h after admission. The primary outcomes were 30 day mortality and length of hospital stay (LOS). Adjustment for confounders was performed with multivariate and propensity score analyses. Of 1410 episodes of CAPP, antibiotic de-escalation within the first 72 h after admission was performed in 166 cases. After adjustment, antibiotic de-escalation was not associated with a higher risk of mortality (OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.24-2.81), but it was found to be a protective factor for prolonged LOS (above the median) (OR = 0.46, 95% CI = 0.30-0.70). Similar results were found in patients classified into high-risk pneumonia severity index classes (IV-V), those with clinical instability and those with bacteraemia. No significant differences were documented in adverse drug reactions or readmission (<30 days). Antibiotic de-escalation seems to be safe and effective in reducing the duration of LOS, and did not adversely affect outcomes of patients with CAPP, even those with bacteraemia and severe disease, and those who were clinically unstable."}

However, the mechanisms mediating its therapeutic effects are not fully understood. Using a model of experimental allergic asthma, we show that induction of IL-27 by R848 is critical for the observed ameliorative effects. R848 significantly inhibited all hallmarks of experimental allergic asthma, including airway hyperreactivity, eosinophilic airway inflammation, mucus hypersecretion, and Ag - specific Ig production. Whereas R848 significantly reduced IL-5, IL-13, and IL-17, it induced IFN-\u03b3 and IL-27. Neutralization of IL-27 completely reversed the therapeutic effect of R848 in the experimental asthma model, demonstrating dependence of R848 -mediated suppression on IL-27. In vitro, R848 induced production of IL-27 by murine alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells and enhanced expression of programmed death-ligand 1, whose expression on monocytes and dendritic cells has been shown to regulate peripheral tolerance in both murine and human studies. Moreover, in vitro IL-27 enhanced secretion of IFN-\u03b3 whereas it inhibited IL-5 and IL-13, demonstrating its direct effect on attenuating Th2 responses. Taken together, our study proves that R848 -mediated suppression of experimental asthma is dependent on IL-27. These data provide evidence of a central role of IL-27 for the control of Th2 -mediated allergic diseases."}

Inhibition of programmed cell death protein 1 and/or its specific ligand programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) was effective in clinical trials in advanced melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) bladder and kidney cancer. The predictive role of the immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of PD-L1 is highly debated. Different reagents, clones, cutoffs of cell expression and subjective interpretation of PD-L1 immunoreactivity in epithelial cells and lymphocytes are the main issue. In this study we selected 58 consecutive NSCLC surgical specimens that underwent pathologic examination from January 2014 to July 2015. Using a tissue microarray approach we evaluated the IHC expression of PD-L1 in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and tumor cells (TCs) and compared the ICH staining with tumor histology, grade and the age of the tissue blocks. The main new finding was the fading of PD-L1 IHC expression in TCs in tissues processed in 2014 compared with 2015. PD-L1 expression in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in the 2 years was similar. We also found a significant higher immunoreactivity of TCs in high grade NSCLC and in the squamous carcinoma histotype compared with low grade tumors and the adenocarcinoma histology (P=0.013). We demonstrated that the IHC evaluation of PD-L1 in NSCLC archival tissues is feasible and can be implemented in a routine pathology setting, but it should be carefully assessed in tissue blocks older than 1 year."}

The final cumulative number of deaths and confirmed cases were estimated to be 1.0921\u00d710(4) (95% CI 9.7706\u00d710(3)-1.2072\u00d710(4)) and 1.5193\u00d710(4) (95% CI 1.3593\u00d710(4)-1.6795\u00d710(4)), respectively. The epidemic was estimated to end on June 2015, which was similar to the data reported by the World Health Organization. A sensitivity analysis indicated that an increase of either the media impact or the number of infectious bats that are captured daily can increase the cumulative number of confirmed cases / deaths. Of the considered epidemiological parameters, only the media coverage can significantly reduce both the peak time and the value of the cumulative confirmed cases / deaths.

Unlike EPI, SS-FSE is ill-suited to diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) due to the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Geill (CPMG) condition. Non-CPMG phase cycling does accommodate SS-FSE and DWI but places constraints on reconstruction, which are resolved here through parallel imaging. Additionally, improved echo stability can be achieved by using short duration and highly selective DIVERSE radiofrequency pulses. Here, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) comparisons between EPI and nCPMG SS-FSE acquisitions and reconstruction techniques give similar values. Diffusion imaging with nCPMG SS-FSE gives similar SNR to an EPI acquisition, though apparent diffusion coefficient values are higher than seen with EPI. In vivo images have good image quality with little distortion. This method has the ability to capture distortion - free DWI images near areas of significant off-resonance as well as preserve adequate SNR. Parallel imaging and DIVERSE refocusing RF pulses allow shorter ETL compared to previous implementations and thus reduces phase encode direction blur and SAR accumulation."}

This study aimed to create an ideal modified bone cement to solve the above-mentioned problems. Modified bone cements were prepared by combining PMMA with three different volume fractions of castor oil (5%, 10%, and 15%). The peak polymerization temperatures, times to achieve the peak polymerization temperature, porosities, densities, modulus and maximum compression strengths of standard (without castor oil), and modified cements were investigated following storage at ambient temperature (22\u00b0C) or under precooling conditions (3\u00b0C). Six specimens were tested in each group of the aforementioned parameters. Increasing castor oil content and precooling treatment effectively decreased the peak polymerization temperatures and increased the duration to achieve the peak polymerization temperature (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the mechanical properties of the material, including density, modulus, and maximum compression strength, decreased with increasing castor oil content. However, preparation temperature (room temperature versus precooling) had no significant effect (P > 0.05) on these mechanical properties. In conclusion, the addition of castor oil to PMMA followed by precooling created an ideal modified bone cement with a low modulus, low polymerization temperature, and long handling time, enhancing its applicability and safety for vertebroplasty."}

The Food and Drug Administration has approved several different medications for migraine prophylaxis, but it is not clear whether sufferers perceive these treatments to provide clinically significant benefits given their side effect profiles. Three hundred headache sufferers were recruited from the community and local headache clinics using print and television advertising. Participants reported experiencing problematic headache attacks with a median (IQR) frequency of 7.0 (4-13) headache days per month. These sufferers participated in a cross-sectional, single-site, study that used a specially designed computer assessment task. Participants were instructed on the probability of experiencing the 3 most commonly experienced side effects for several blinded medication profiles: divalproex sodium, venlafaxine, gabapentin, propranolol, and topiramate. After learning the likelihood of experiencing side effect profiles of each medication, participants were asked whether they would be willing to take the medication for a given headache reduction level, which ranged from 0 to 7 days per month. The side effect profile for divalproex sodium was associated with the smallest willingness to take, with gabapentin, propranolol, and topiramate perceived to be much more agreeable. However, <60% of participants reported willingness to take any of these medications even if they provided a 50% reduction in headache frequency. Several general predictors of willingness to take were observed including high headache -related disability, depressive symptoms, and pain medication concerns including fear of tolerance. These findings suggest that if properly informed of the side effect profiles of these medications, many patients might opt for other treatments."}

In the present study, we performed Extended Haplotype Homozygosity (EHH) tests to identify significant core regions employing 600K SNP Chicken chip in an F2 population of 1,534 hens, which was derived from reciprocal crosses between White Leghorn and Dongxiang chicken. Results indicated that a total of 49,151 core regions with an average length of 9.79 Kb were identified, which occupied approximately 52.15% of genome across all autosomes, and 806 significant core regions attracted us mostly. Genes in candidate regions may experience positive selection and were considered to have possible influence on beneficial economic traits. A panel of genes including AASDHPPT, GDPD5, PAR3, SOX6, GPC1 and a signal pathway of AKT1 were detected with the most extreme P-values. Further enrichment analyses indicated that these genes were associated with immune function, sensory organ development and neurogenesis, and may have experienced positive selection in chicken. Moreover, some of core regions exactly overlapped with genes excavated in our previous GWAS, suggesting that these genes have undergone positive selection may affect egg production. Findings in our study could draw a comparatively integrate genome-wide map of selection signature in the chicken genome, and would be worthy for explicating the genetic mechanisms of phenotypic diversity in poultry breeding."}

Here we examined for the first time the role of P2X7R in an animal model of schizophrenia. Using the PCP induced schizophrenia model we show that both genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition of P2X7Rs alleviate schizophrenia-like behavioral alterations. In P2rx7+/+ mice, PCP induced hyperlocomotion, stereotype behavior, ataxia and social withdrawal. In P2X7 receptor deficient mice (P2rx7-/-), the social interactions were increased, whereas the PCP induced hyperlocomotion and stereotype behavior were alleviated. The selective P2X7 receptor antagonist JNJ-47965567 partly replicated the effect of gene deficiency on PCP - induced behavioral changes and counteracted PCP - induced social withdrawal. We also show that PCP treatment upregulates and increases the functional responsiveness of P2X7Rs in the prefrontal cortex of young adult animals. The amplitude of NMDA evoked currents recorded from layer V pyramidal neurons of cortical slices were slightly decreased by both genetic deletion of P2rx7 and by JNJ-47965567. PCP induced alterations in mRNA expression encoding schizophrenia-related genes, such as NR2A, NR2B, neuregulin 1, NR1 and GABA \u03b11 subunit were absent in the PFC of young adult P2rx7-/- animals.

One of the most specious and best-defined genera is Euplotes, which constitutes more than 70 morphospecies, many of which have never been molecularly tested. The increasing number of described Euplotes taxa emphasizes the importance for detailed characterizations of new ones, requiring standardized morphological observations, sequencing of molecular markers and careful comparison with previous literature. Here we describe Euplotes curdsi sp. nov ., distinguishable by the combination of the following features: 45-65 \u03bcm length, oval or elongated shape with both ends rounded, narrow peristome with 25-34 adoral membranelles, conspicuous paroral membrane, double-eurystomus dorsal argyrome type, 6-7 dorsolateral kineties and 10 frontoventral cirri. Three populations of the novel species have been found in brackish and marine samples in the Mediterranean and the White Sea. We provide the SSU rRNA gene sequences of these populations, and an updated phylogeny of the genus Euplotes. Using the molecular phylogenetic tree, we inferred aspects of the biogeographical history of the genus and the evolution of its most important taxonomic characters in order to provide a frame for future descriptions. Ultimately, these data reveal recurrent trends of freshwater invasion and highlight the dynamic, yet convergent, morphological evolution of Euplotes."}

To determine current treatment options of chronic low back pain (LBP) as defined by randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and to compare effectiveness of those treatments using a mixed-treatment comparison (MTC). It is important to provide an evidence-based assessment of the treatment options that exist for LBP. A systematic search of RCTs was conducted in MEDLINE and the Cochrane Collaboration Library from 1990 to 2014. From the selected studies, we extracted preoperative and postoperative ODI and VAS back pain scores, additional surgeries, and complications. Standard and network meta-analytic techniques were used. Twelve RCTs were included in the analysis: 5 total disk replacement (TDR) versus fusion; 1 TDR versus exercise and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT); 5 fusion versus exercise and CBT; and 1 fusion versus physical therapy (PT). On the basis of MTC, with respect to ODI change scores, the pooled mean difference favoring fusion over exercise and CBT was 2.0 points (95% CI, -1.2 to 4.8). The pooled mean difference favoring TDR over exercise and CBT was 6.4 points (95% CI, 3.2-9.3). The pooled mean difference favoring fusion over PT was 8.8 points (95% CI, 4.1-13.6).

Delta-5 desaturase (D5D) is an enzyme that metabolizes dihomo-\u03b3-linolenic acid (DGLA) to arachidonic acid (AA). Thus, D5D inhibition increases DGLA (precursor to anti-inflammatory eicosanoids) while decreasing AA (precursor to pro-inflammatory eicosanoids), and could result in synergistic improvement in the low-grade inflammatory state. Here, we demonstrate reduced insulin resistance and the anti-obesity effect of a D5D selective inhibitor (compound-326), an orally active small-molecule, in a high-fat diet -induced obese (DIO) mouse model. In vivo D5D inhibition was confirmed by determining changes in blood AA / DGLA profiles. In DIO mice, chronic treatment with compound-326 lowered insulin resistance and caused body weight loss without significant impact on cumulative calorie intake. Decreased macrophage infiltration into adipose tissue was expected from mRNA analysis. Increased daily energy expenditure was also observed following administration of compound-326, in line with sustained body weight loss. These data indicate that the novel D5D selective inhibitor, compound-326, will be a new class of drug for the treatment of obese and diabetic patients."}

Selective pressures on the subcontinent have recurrently produced several allelic variants of parasite drug resistance genes, including the P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt). Despite significant reductions in the deployment of the 4-aminoquinoline drug chloroquine (CQ), which selected for the mutant pfcrt alleles that halted CQ efficacy decades ago, the parasite pfcrt locus is continuously evolving. This is highlighted by the presence of a highly mutated allele, Cam734 pfcrt, which has acquired the singular ability to confer parasite CQ resistance without an associated fitness cost. Here, we used pfcrt -specific zinc-finger nucleases to genetically dissect this allele in the pathogenic setting of asexual blood-stage infection. Comparative analysis of drug resistance and growth profiles of recombinant parasites that express Cam734 or variants thereof, Dd2 (the most common Southeast Asian variant), or wild-type pfcrt, revealed previously unknown roles for PfCRT mutations in modulating parasite susceptibility to multiple antimalarial agents. These results were generated in the GC03 strain, used in multiple earlier pfcrt studies, and might differ in natural isolates harboring this allele. Results presented herein show that Cam734 -mediated CQ resistance is dependent on the rare A144F mutation that has not been observed beyond Southeast Asia, and reveal distinct impacts of this and other Cam734 -specific mutations on CQ resistance and parasite growth rates. Biochemical assays revealed a broad impact of mutant PfCRT isoforms on parasite metabolism, including nucleoside triphosphate levels, hemoglobin catabolism and disposition of heme, as well as digestive vacuole volume and pH.

In a combined in vivo - in vitro bovine model, two groups of cows (n=3 in each group) were fed with three diets consecutively (4 weeks feeding for each): (1) a maintenance control diet (CONT); (2) a high - starch diet rich in saturated fat (SAT); and (3) a high - starch diet rich in omega-3 unsaturated fat (UNSAT). Two feeding sequences were used to test for carry-over effects: Group A was fed CONT, SAT1 and then UNSAT2, whereas Group B was fed CONT, UNSAT1 and then SAT2. Serum was collected after each dietary period, analysed and tested in bovine in vitro embryo culture. Introducing SAT and UNSAT diets induced hyperlipidaemia (specifically hypercholesterolaemia and elevated free FAs) and reduced insulin sensitivity. Carry-over effects in serum metabolites and FA profile were dependent on the diet and feeding sequence. SAT1 and SAT2 serum decreased blastocyst rates and altered blastocyst mRNA expression related to apoptosis and oxidative stress. UNSAT1 and UNSAT2 serum resulted in normal embryo development and quality. Other in vitro effects depended on the sequence of feeding. In conclusion, substitution of saturated fat with omega-3 fat in a high-caloric diet induced hyperlipidaemia with an FA profile yielding similar rates and quality of blastocysts compared with normolipidaemic controls."}

We conducted a population-level time-series analysis of all individuals who underwent carotid endarterectomy and stenting in Ontario, Canada (2002-2014). The primary analysis examined temporal changes in the rates of carotid revascularization procedures after publications of major randomized trials. Secondary analyses examined changes in overall and age, sex, carotid-artery symptom, and operator specialty-specific procedure rates. A total of 16 772 patients were studied (14 394 endarterectomy [86%]; 2378 stenting [14%]). The overall rate of carotid revascularization decreased from 6.0 procedures per 100 000 individuals \u226540 years old in April 2002 to 4.3 procedures in the first quarter of 2014 (29% decrease; P<0.001). The rate of endarterectomy decreased by 36% (P<0.001), whereas the rate of carotid-artery stenting increased by 72% (P=0.006). We observed a marked increase (P=0.01) in stenting after publication of the SAPPHIRE trial (Stenting and Angioplasty With Protection in Patients at High Risk for Endarterectomy) in 2004, whereas stenting remained relatively unchanged after subsequent randomized trials published in 2006 (P=0.11) and 2010 (P=0.34). In contrast, endarterectomy decreased after trials published in 2006 (P=0.04) and 2010 (P=0.005). Although the overall rates of carotid revascularization and endarterectomy have fallen since 2002, the rate of carotid-artery stenting has risen since the publication of stenting -favorable SAPPHIRE trial.

A range of techniques was applied to characterize four different substrate / surface treatment combinations (TiSLA, TiSLActive, TiZrSLA, and TiZrSLActive). Contact angle measurements establish establish their hydrophilic / hydrophobic nature. Surface morphology was probed with scanning electron microscopy. X-ray diffraction, Raman \u03bc-spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to elucidate the composition of the near- surface region. Consistent with previous work, surface morphology was found to differ only at the nanoscale, with both SLActive substrates displaying nano - protrusions. Spectroscopic data indicate that all substrates exhibit surface films of titanium oxide displaying near TiO2 stoichiometry. Raman \u03bc-spectroscopy reveals that amorphous TiO2 is most likely the only phase present on TiSLA, whilst rutile - TiO2 is also evidenced on TiSLActive, TiZrSLA, and TiZrSLActive. For TiZr alloy substrates, there is no evidence of discrete phases of oxidized Zr. X-ray photoelectron spectra demonstrate that all samples are terminated by adventitious carbon, with it being somewhat thicker (\u223c1nm) on TiSLA and TiZrSLA. Given previous in vivo studies, acquired data suggest that both nanoscale protrusions, and a thinner layer of adventitious carbon contribute to the more rapid osseointegration of SLActive dental implants.

In rodents, cue-induced drug seeking requires transient synaptic potentiation (t-SP) of cortical glutamatergic synapses on nucleus accumbens core medium spiny neurons, but it is unknown how achieving drug use affects this plasticity. We modeled the two phases of relapse after extinction from cocaine self-administration to assess how cocaine use affects t-SP associated with cue-induced drug seeking. Rats were trained to self-administer cocaine (n = 96) or were used as yoked - saline control animals (n = 21). After extinction, reinstatement was initiated by 10 minutes of cue-induced drug seeking, followed by 45 minutes with contingent cocaine access, after which cocaine was discontinued and unreinforced lever pressing ensued. Three measures of t-SP were assayed during reinstatement: dendritic spine morphology, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) ratios, and matrix metalloproteinase activity. We found that cocaine use for 10 minutes collapsed all three measures of cue-potentiated t-SP back to baseline. Moreover, when cocaine use was discontinued 45 minutes later, dendritic spine morphology and AMPA to NMDA ratios were restored as animals became motivated to engage unrewarded lever pressing. Nonreinforced drug seeking was positively correlated with changes in spine morphology, and cocaine access reversed this relationship. Using a novel modification of the reinstatement paradigm, we show that achieving cocaine use reversed the synaptic plasticity underpinning the motivation to seek the drug."}

Delicaflavone exhibited favorable anticancer properties, as shown by the MTT assay and xenograft model of human non-small cell lung cancer in male BALB/c nude mice without observable adverse effect. By transmission electron microscopy with acridine orange and Cyto-ID\u00aeAutophagy detection dyes, Western blot analysis, and RT-PCR assay, we confirmed that delicaflavone induces autophagic cell death by increasing the ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I, which are autophagy-related proteins, and promoting the generation of acidic vesicular organelles and autolysosomes in the cytoplasm of human lung cancer A549 and PC-9 cells in a time - and dose-dependent manner. Delicaflavone downregulated the expression of phospho-Akt, phospho-mTOR, and phospho-p70S6K in a time - and dose-dependent manner, suggesting that it induced autophagy by inhibiting the Akt / mTOR / p70S6K pathway in A549 and PC-9 cells.

Perfusion with netarsudil-M1 significantly increased C when compared to baseline (51%, P < 0.01) and to paired controls (102%, P < 0.01), as well as significantly increased PEFL in both IW (P < 0.05) and ESVs (P < 0.01). In treated eyes, PEFL was significantly higher in ESVs than in the IW (P < 0.01) and was associated with increased cross-sectional area of ESVs (P < 0.01). Percentage effective filtration length in ESVs positively correlated with the percentage change in C (R2 = 0.58, P = 0.01). A significant increase in juxtacanalicular connective tissue (JCT) thickness (P < 0.05) was found in treated eyes compared to controls. Netarsudil acutely increased C by expansion of the JCT and dilating the ESVs, which led to redistribution of aqueous outflow through a larger area of the IW and ESVs."}

Most research on treatment disparities in men with prostate cancer has focused on race and socioeconomic factors. However, the geography of disparities - capturing racial and socioeconomic differences based on where patients live - can provide insight into barriers to care and help identify outlier areas in which access to care, health resources, or both are more pronounced. Research regarding treatment patterns and disparities in prostate cancer using the Geographical Information System (GIS) was searched. Studies were limited to English-language articles and research focused on US populations. A total of 43 articles were found; of those, 30 provided information about or used spatial or geographical analyses to assess and describe differences or disparities in prostate cancer and its treatment. Two additional GIS resources were included. The research on geographical and spatial determinants of prostate cancer disparities was reviewed. We also examined geographical analyses at the state level, focusing on Florida. Overall, we described a geographical framework to disparities that affect men with prostate cancer and reviewed existing published evidence supporting the interplay of geographical factors and disparities in prostate cancer. Disparities in prostate cancer are common and persistent, and notable differences in treatment are observable across racial and socioeconomic strata. Geographical analysis provides additional information about where disparate groups live and also helps to map access to care. This information can be used by public health officials, health-systems administrators, clinicians, and policymakers to better understand and respond to geographical barriers that contribute to disparities in care."}

They accommodate cell proliferation and migration by negatively regulate gene expression either by hampering the translation of targeted mRNAs or by promoting their degradation. We characterized and identified the novel miR-9600 and its target in human non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our results demonstrated that the miR-9600 were downregulated in NSCLC tissues and cells. It is confirmed that signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), a putative target gene, is directly inhibited by miR-9600. The miR-9600 markedly suppressed the protein expression of STAT3, but with no significant influence in corresponding mRNA levels, and the direct combination of miR-9600 and STAT3 was confirmed by a luciferase reporter assay. miR-9600 inhibited cell growth, hampered expression of cell cycle -related proteins and inhibited cell migration and invasion in human NSCLC cell lines. Further, miR-9600 significantly suppressed tumor growth in nude mice. Similarly, miR-9600 impeded tumorigenesis and metastasis through directly targeting STAT3. Furthermore, we identified that miR-9600 augmented paclitaxel and cisplatin sensitivity by downregulating STAT3 and promoting chemotherapy - induced apoptosis. These data demonstrate that miR-9600 might be a useful and novel therapeutic target for NSCLC."}

Rats with developing type II collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) were treated once daily by oral gavage on study days -14 to 17 with vehicle or NEM (52 mg/kg body weight). Rats were euthanized on study day 17. Efficacy was assessed by daily ankle caliper measurements, ankle diameter expressed as area under the curve (AUCd0-17), and histopathologic evaluation of ankles and knees. Serum biomarkers of cartilage function and inflammation [collagen type II C-telopeptide (CTXII), cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), and alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M)] were measured by ELISA. Treatment with NEM resulted in significant beneficial effects on the daily ankle diameter measurements and ankle diameter AUC. Ankle and knee histopathology scores were significantly reduced (36% and 43% reduction of summed individual histopathology scores for ankle and knee, respectively; p < 0.05) toward normal for rats given NEM compared to vehicle controls. The percent reduction of serum CTXII, COMP, and A2M in NEM - treated rats ranged from 30% to 72% (p < 0.05). NEM significantly improved multiple aspects of inflammatory arthritis including inflammation, pannus, cartilage damage, bone resorption, and periosteal bone formation. This study provides further support for the use of CTXII, COMP, and A2M as relevant biomarkers that were responsive to NEM."}

Methods: A pair-matched, placebo-controlled study design included 20 resistance-trained participants assigned to IHRT (FIO2 0.143) or placebo (FIO2 0.20), (n = 10 per group). Participants were matched for strength and training. Both groups performed 20 sessions over 7 weeks either with IHRT or placebo. All participants were tested for 1RM, 20-m sprint, body composition, and countermovement jump pre -, mid -, and post - training and compared via magnitude - based inferences. Presentation of Results: Groups were not clearly different for any test at baseline. Training improved both absolute (IHRT: 13.1 \u00b1 3.9%, effect size (ES) 0.60, placebo 9.8 \u00b1 4.7%, ES 0.31) and relative 1RM (IHRT: 13.4 \u00b1 5.1%, ES 0.76, placebo 9.7 \u00b1 5.3%, ES 0.48) at mid. Similarly, at post both groups increased absolute (IHRT: 20.7 \u00b1 7.6%, ES 0.74, placebo 14.1 \u00b1 6.0%, ES 0.58) and relative 1RM (IHRT: 21.6 \u00b1 8.5%, ES 1.08, placebo 13.2 \u00b1 6.4%, ES 0.78).

The aims of the study were to evaluate Spinal dysraphisms using USG and MRI and to correlate imaging findings with operative findings in patients undergoing surgery. Hospital based observational study conducted over a period of year. 38 cases of both sexes and below 12 years of age with spinal dysraphism were studied. USG was performed in 29 cases where acoustic window was available for proper evaluation. MRI was performed in all cases. USG findings were compared with MRI findings and operative follow up was taken in 23 cases who underwent operative management. Results were analysed using percentage and arithmetic mean. 39.47 % cases were male and 60.53 % cases were female. Neonatal period was the most common presenting age group. Closed spinal dysraphism (63.16%) was more common than open (36.84%). 79.31% cases showed full agreement between spinal USG and MRI examinations and 6 out of 20.69% showed partial agreement. On operative correlation, USG findings were confirmatory in 91.30% cases and MRI findings were confirmatory in 100% cases. USG can be used as the initial modality for evaluation of spinal dysraphism as well as for screening of suspected cases. MRI is indicated to confirm abnormal USG findings, which shows all concurrent abnormalities and also provides additional anatomical details relevant to surgical planning."}

Recent proposals that nuclear bodies form through liquid-liquid phase separation leave the question of how different nuclear bodies maintain their distinct identities unanswered. Here we investigate Cajal bodies (CBs), histone locus bodies (HLBs) and nucleoli - involved in assembly of the splicing machinery, histone mRNA 3' end processing, and rRNA processing, respectively - in the embryos of the zebrafish, Danio rerio. We take advantage of the transcriptional silence of the 1-cell embryo and follow nuclear body appearance as zygotic transcription becomes activated. CBs are present from fertilization onwards, while HLB and nucleolar components formed foci several hours later when histone genes and rDNA became active. HLB formation was blocked by transcription inhibition, suggesting nascent histone transcripts recruit HLB components like U7 snRNP. Surprisingly, we found that U7 base-pairing with nascent histone transcripts was not required for localization to HLBs. Rather, the type of Sm ring assembled on U7 determined its targeting to HLBs or CBs; the spliceosomal Sm ring targeted snRNAs to CBs while the specialized U7 Sm-ring localized to HLBs, demonstrating the contribution of protein constituents to the distinction among nuclear bodies. Thus, nucleolar, HLB, and CB components can mix in early embryogenesis when transcription is naturally or artificially silenced. These data support a model in which transcription of specific gene loci nucleates nuclear body components with high specificity and fidelity to perform distinct regulatory functions."}

Although age at first reproduction is a key demographic parameter that is probably under high selective pressure, it is highly variable and the cause of this variability is not well understood. Two non-exclusive hypotheses may explain such variability. It could be the expression of different individual strategies, i.e., different allocation strategies in fitness components, or the consequences of individual difference in intrinsic quality, i.e., some individuals always doing better than others in all fitness components. We tested these hypotheses in the Wandering Albatross investigating relationships between the age at first reproduction and subsequent adult demographic traits. Using finite mixture capture recapture modeling, we demonstrate that the age at first reproduction is negatively related to both reproductive performances and adult survival, suggesting that individual quality was an important factor explaining variation in the age at first reproduction. Our results suggest that age at first breeding is a good predictor of quality in this long-lived seabird species."}

In a large UK -based prospective study we examined associations of 14 postulated risk factors with colorectal cancer risk overall, and across three anatomical sites and four morphological subtypes. Among 1.3 million women, 18,518 incident colorectal cancers were identified during 13.8 (SD 3.4) years follow-up via record linkage to national cancer registry data. Cox regression yielded adjusted relative risks. Statistical significance was assessed using correction for multiple testing. Overall, colorectal cancer risk was significantly associated with height, body mass index (BMI), smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity, parity and menopausal hormone therapy use. For smoking there was substantial heterogeneity across morphological types; relative risks around two or greater were seen in current smokers both for signet ring cell and for neuroendocrine tumours. Obese women were also at higher risk for signet ring cell tumours. For adenocarcinomas, the large majority of colorectal cancers in the cohort, all risk factor associations were weak. There was little or no heterogeneity in risk between tumours of the right colon, left colon and rectum for any of the 14 factors examined. These epidemiological findings complement an emerging picture from molecular studies of possible different developmental pathways for different tumour types."}

Recent work suggests that successful inhibition and cognitive control involve electrophysiological theta-band dynamics, including medial frontal cortex (MFC) power enhancement and functional connectivity between the MFC and dorsal prefrontal cortex (dPFC) regions, which may be disrupted by alcohol misuse. In addition, research suggests that, compared to men, women are at heightened risk of experiencing the negative physical and neurocognitive correlates of drinking. The present study tested the hypothesis that alcohol misuse has a deleterious effect on theta-band response inhibition EEG dynamics in a sample of 300 24-year-old same-sex twins. A cotwin control (CTC) design was used to disentangle premorbid risk for alcohol use from the causal effects of alcohol exposure. Drinking was negatively associated with theta-band MFC power and MFC - dPFC connectivity during response inhibition, and this effect was stronger among women. The CTC analysis suggested that, for women, reduced nogo-related theta-band MFC power and MFC - dPFC connectivity were both consistent with the potential deleterious causal effects of alcohol exposure. These findings suggest that diminished theta-band MFC power and MFC - dPFC connectivity may be neurophysiological mechanisms underlying alcohol-related disinhibition. Although preliminary, these results suggest that normative levels of alcohol use during emerging adulthood have potential sex-specific causal effects on response inhibition EEG dynamics, and thus have potentially significant public health implications."}

However, the causes of this event are unknown. We hypothesized that PIs might impair innate immune responses through the inhibition of proteases participating in the anti-bacterial functions of neutrophils and monocytes. The aims of the study were to assess phagocytic and oxidative burst capacity in neutrophils and monocytes obtained from patients receiving a PI containing- antiviral regimen, and to determine cytokine secretion after neutrophil stimulation with flagellin.

The World Mental Health Survey version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) was used to establish the diagnosis of past 12- month DSM-IV depression, and assess four positive psychotic symptoms. Depression was defined as self-reported lifetime depression diagnosis and/or past 12- month depression. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed. After adjustment for potential confounders, women who experienced child death had higher odds for all types of PLEs (when unadjusted for depression) (OR 1.20-1.71; p<0.05) and depression (OR =1.64; 95% CI =1.39-1.93). When adjusted for depression, only delusion of control was strongly associated with child death (OR =1.54; 95% CI =1.20-1.97).

Visual attention to the eye-region was assessed on both occasions while participants completed a static facial emotion recognition task using medium intensity facial expressions. Although OXT had no effect on emotion recognition accuracy, recognition performance was improved because face processing was faster across emotions under the influence of OXT. This effect was marginally significant (p<.06). Consistent with a previous study using dynamic stimuli, OXT had no effect on eye - gaze patterns when viewing static emotional faces and this was not related to recognition accuracy or face processing time. These findings suggest that OXT - induced enhanced facial emotion recognition is not necessarily mediated by an increase in attention to the eye-region of faces, as previously assumed.

This condition will, initially, improve the organ contractile function, but if sustained will render dysfunctional mitochondria and oxidative stress. Mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K(+) channels (mitoKATP) modulate the redox status of the cell and protect against several cardiac insults. Here, we tested the hypothesis that mitoKATP opening (using diazoxide) will avoid isoproterenol - induced cardiac hypertrophy in vivo by decreasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mitochondrial Ca(2+) - induced swelling. To induce cardiac hypertrophy, Swiss mice were treated intraperitoneally with isoproterenol (30 mg/kg/ day) for 8 days. Diazoxide (5 mg/kg/ day) was used to open mitoKATP and 5-hydroxydecanoate (5 mg/kg/ day) was administrated as a mitoKATP blocker. Isoproterenol - treated mice had elevated heart weight / tibia length ratios and increased myocyte cross-sectional areas. Additionally, hypertrophic hearts produced higher levels of H2O2 and had lower glutathione peroxidase activity. In contrast, mitoKATP opening with diazoxide blocked all isoproterenol effects in a manner reversed by 5-hydroxydecanoate. Isolated mitochondria from Isoproterenol - induced hypertrophic hearts had increased susceptibility to Ca(2+) - induced swelling secondary to mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening. MitokATP opening was accompanied by lower Ca(2+) - induced mitochondrial swelling, an effect blocked by 5-hydroxydecanoate. Our results suggest that mitoKATP opening negatively regulates cardiac hypertrophy by avoiding oxidative impairment and mitochondrial damage."}

The activation of small- and intermediate-conductance of Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels (SKCa and IKCa) underpins EDH -mediated responses. It was recently reported that Ca(2+) influx through endothelial transient receptor potential vanilloid type 4 channel (TRPV4) is a prerequisite for the activation of SKCa / IKCa in endothelial cells in specific beds. Here, we attempted to determine whether the impairment of EDH in hypertension is attributable to the dysfunction of TRPV4 and S / IKCa, using isolated superior mesenteric arteries of 20-week-old stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) and age-matched Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. In the WKY arteries, EDH -mediated responses were reduced by a combination of SKCa / IKCa blockers (apamin plus TRAM-34; 1-[(2-chlorophenyl)diphenylmethl]-1H-pyrazole) and by the blockade of TRPV4 with the selective antagonist RN-1734 or HC-067047. In the SHRSP arteries, EDH-mediated hyperpolarization and relaxation were significantly impaired when compared with WKY. GSK1016790A, a selective TRPV4 activator, evoked robust hyperpolarization and relaxation in WKY arteries. In contrast, in SHRSP arteries, the GSK1016790A -evoked hyperpolarization was small and relaxation was absent. "}

These findings suggest that EDH -mediated responses are impaired in superior mesenteric arteries of SHRSP because of a reduction in both TRPV4 and SKCa input to EDH."}

Thriasio Plain is a plain near Athens, Greece, where most of the heavy industry of the country has been situated for decades, but it also is a residential and horticultural area. We aimed at measuring the levels of PTEs in soils and indigenous plant species and assessing the health risk associated with direct soil ingestion. Samples of soils at roadsides and growing plants were collected from 31 sites of that area. Concentrations of Al, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, V and Zn were measured in both soils (as pseudo-total) and aerial plant tissues. We found that As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn were higher than maximum regulatory limits. Element concentrations in plants were rather lower than expected, probably because indigenous plants have developed excluder behaviour over time. Copper and Zn soil -to- plant coefficients were highest among the other elements; for Cu this was unexpected, and probably associated with recent Cu - releasing industrial activity. Risk assessment analysis indicated that As was the element contributing more than 50 % of the health risk related to direct soil ingestion, followed by Cr, Pb, and, surprisingly, Mn. We concluded that in a multi - element contamination situation, elevated risk of PTEs (such as As, Cr and Pb) may reduce the tolerance limits of exposure to less- toxic elements (here, Mn)."}

Urbanization of coastlines is leading to increased introduction of nutrients from the terrestrial environment to nearshore habitats. While such nutrient influxes can be detrimental to coastal marine organisms due to increased eutrophication and subsequent reduced oxygen, they could also have positive effects (i.e., increased food availability) on species that are nitrogen-limited such as macroalgae. Nutrient enrichment in this environment thus has the potential to counteract some of the negative impacts of increasing temperatures, at least for some species. Characterizing the physiological response of organisms to simultaneous changes in multiple drivers such as these is an important first step in predicting how global climate change may lead to ecological responses at more local levels. We evaluated how nutrient enrichment (i.e., nitrogen availability) affected the growth of Fucus vesiculosus, a foundational macroalgal species in the North Atlantic rocky intertidal zone, and found that nutrient -enriched algal blades showed a significant increase in tissue growth compared to individuals grown under ambient conditions. We further quantified net photosynthesis by ambient and nutrient -enriched tissues at saturating irradiance over a range of temperature conditions (6-30\u00b0C). Respiration was unaffected by nutrient treatment; however, there was a significant increase in photosynthetic oxygen production for nutrient -enriched tissue compared to ambient, but only at elevated (\u226518\u00b0C) temperatures. This study contributes to a growing body of literature showing the complexity of responses to changes in multiple drivers, and highlights the importance of studying the impacts of global climate change within the context of more local environmental conditions."}

Eligible participants are enrolled under an exception to consent process and randomly assigned via concealed allocation to either the Usual Care (control) or Fluid Sparing (intervention) resuscitation strategy. The primary objective of this pilot trial is to determine feasibility, based on the ability to enroll participants and to adhere to the study protocol. The primary outcome measure by which success will be determined is participant enrollment rate (\"pass\" defined as at least two participants / site / month, recognizing that enrollment may be slower during the run-in phase). Secondary objectives include assessing (1) appropriateness of eligibility criteria, and (2) completeness of clinical outcomes to inform the endpoints for the planned multisite trial. To support the nested translational study, SQUEEZE-D, we will also evaluate the feasibility of describing cell-free DNA (a procoagulant molecule with prognostic utility) in blood samples obtained from children enrolled into the SQUEEZE Pilot Trial at baseline and at 24 h.

Our objective was to develop and evaluate a clinical decision support system (CDSS) for pharmacogenomic -guided warfarin dosing designed for physicians and pharmacists. Twelve physicians and pharmacists completed 6 prescribing tasks using simulated patient scenarios in two iterations (development and validation phases) of a newly developed pharmacogenomic -driven CDSS prototype. For each scenario, usability was measured via efficiency, recorded as time to task completion, and participants ' perceived satisfaction which were compared using Kruskal-Wallis and Mann Whitney U tests, respectively. Debrief interviews were conducted and qualitatively analyzed. Usability findings from the first (i.e. development) iteration were incorporated into the CDSS design for the second (i.e. validation) iteration. During the CDSS validation iteration, participants took more time to complete tasks with a median (IQR) of 183 (124-247) seconds versus 101 (73.5-197) seconds in the development iteration (p=0.01). This increase in time on task was due to the increase in time spent in the CDSS corresponding to several design changes. Efficiency differences that were observed between pharmacists and physicians in the development iteration were eliminated in the validation iteration. The increased use of the CDSS corresponded to a greater acceptance of CDSS recommended doses in the validation iteration (4% in the first iteration vs. 37.5% in the second iteration, p<0.001). Overall satisfaction did not change statistically between the iterations but the qualitative analysis revealed greater trust in the second prototype. A pharmacogenomic -guided CDSS has been developed using warfarin as the test drug. The final CDSS prototype was trusted by prescribers and significantly increased the time using the tool and acceptance of the recommended doses. This study is an important step toward incorporating pharmacogenomics into CDSS design for clinical testing."}

Introduction of a novel technique for the treatment of congenital C2-C3 fusion and basilar invagination (BI). Posterior occipitocervical fixation using C2 pedicle screw was widely used for BI. However, in cases where BI is concurrent with congenital C2-C3 fusion, the C2 pedicles tend to be thinner than that in normal population and hence more likely to fail. We prompted to tackle the issue by combining the pedicle screw with the additional use of LMS in attempt to strengthen the fixation. Twenty-five patients who underwent combined pedicle screw with LMS fixation were retrospectively studied. The instrument position, fusion status, and complications were analyzed. None had spinal cord or vertebral artery injury. The average follow-up time was 20 months. Solid fusion was achieved in 23 patients (92%) as detected radiologically. Two cases suffered from recurred BI and instrument failure but eventually achieved solid fusion between the occiput and C2 was after revision. Among all 25 patients, 4 suffered from complications including instrument s failure, cerebrospinal fluid leakage, and intracranial infection. The clinical outcome indicates that the technique is reliable for the treatment of BI with congenital C2-C3 fusion."}

A PPMV-1 isolate, abbreviated as PPMV-1/QL-01/CH/15, was isolated from a great spotted woodpecker in the northwest region of China in 2015. The complete genome was sequenced, and the results showed that the virus genome was 15,192 nt in length, in the gene arrangement 3'-NP-P-M-F-HN-L-5'. Several amino acid mutations were identified in the functional domains of the F and HN proteins. The pathogenicity index of the isolate was evaluated, and the mean death time (MDT) was 72 h and the intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) was 0.925, indicating that this isolate was mesogenic. Sequencing results showed that it had a virulent Newcastle disease virus cleavage motif (112)R-R-Q-K-R-F(117) at the fusion protein cleavage site. Morbidity and mortality were 70% and 50%, after inoculation of pigeons, whereas this virus was nonpathogenic in chickens. Different immune responses of pigeons and chickens were induced in vivo, which led to different HI serum antibody titers. The results of phylogenetic and evolutionary distance analysis showed that this PPMV-1 strain belonged to sub-genotype VIa in class II. To our knowledge, this is the first identification and analysis of PPMV-1 co-circulation among wild birds and domestic pigeon flocks in China. The data from this study highlight the important role of wild birds in the dissemination of PPMV-1 and provide useful references for improving our understanding of the distribution and evolution of PPMV-1 in China."}

We used standardized batch incubations and the Mucosal-Simulator of the Human Microbial Intestinal Ecosystem (M-SHIME) to show the in vitro luminal and mucosal effects of the main PUFA in the Western diet, linoleic acid (LA). High concentrations of LA were found to decrease butyrate production and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii numbers dependent on LA biohydrogenation to vaccenic acid (VA) and stearic acid (SA). In faecal batch incubations, LA biohydrogenation and butyrate production were positively correlated and SA did not inhibit butyrate production. In the M-SHIME, addition of a mucosal environment stimulated biohydrogenation to SA and protected F. prausnitzii from inhibition by LA. This was probably due to the preference of two biohydrogenating genera Roseburia and Pseudobutyrivibrio for the mucosal niche. Co-culture batch incubations using Roseburia hominis and F. prausnitzii validated these observations. Correlations networks further uncovered the central role of Roseburia and Pseudobutyrivibrio in protecting luminal and mucosal SHIME microbiota from LA - induced stress.

Udder s were scored subjectively on a 1-5 scale (1 - udder intact and 5 - udder damaged severely) and ticks were counted on three locations. The body sites counted were the head and thoracic limb (HTLTC), udder-pelvic limb (UPLTC) and perineum-breech-tail (PBTTC). These counts were also totaled for a total tick count (TTC). Reproduction traits were number of lambs weaned per ewe lambed and total weight of lamb weaned per ewe lambed. Udder health scores of NA ewes were lower than those of Dorpers, which in turn had lower scores than SAMM ewes. NA ewes had lower values for HTLTC, UPLTC and TTC than the commercial breeds, but higher values for PBTTC than Dorpers.

The aim of this study was to investigate the formation of persister cells in P. aeruginosa stationary vs. exponential cultures using different class antimicrobials. The susceptibilities of P. aeruginosa PAO1 wild-type and mutant strains to antimicrobials were determined by standard microtiter broth dilution method. In order to determine persister formation, dose - and time -dependent killing experiments were performed with antibiotics. Ceftazidime (Cephalosporin) showed little efficacy against either culture. Stationary-phase cells were more tolerant to imipenem (Carbapenem) than exponential cells, leaving a small fraction of persisters at high imipenem concentration in both populations. Polymyxin B (Polymyxin) appeared to be ineffective at low concentrations against both cell populations. Very high polymyxin B concentration completely eradicated exponential cells and regrowth was seen in a stationary population. Stationary cells were more tolerant to tobramycin (Aminoglycoside) than exponential cells but a higher concentration of tobramycin completely eliminated survivors. Ciprofloxacin (Fluoroquinolone) at a low concentration resulted in killing of both cultures of P. aeruginosa, producing persisters that were invulnerable to killing. Stationary cells appear to be somewhat more tolerant than exponential cells in all of these assays. We also showed that nutrient deprivation (serine starvation) regulated by stringent and general stress response, contribute to the increased tolerance of P. aeruginosa exponential and stationary planktonic cells via production of persisters."}

However, the high concentrations of HCO3(-) reduced the reaction rate. CtFDH was modeled in the presence of HCO3(-) showing that it fits to the active site. The active site setting for hydride transfer in CO2 reduction was modeled. The hydride donated by NADH would form a favorable contact to the carbon atom of HCO3(-), resulting in a surplus of electrons within the molecule.

An educational programme for health care professionals working in maternal and child health has been designed to address these needs according to the Perinatal Society of Australia and New Zealand Guideline for Perinatal Mortality: IMproving Perinatal mortality Review and Outcomes Via Education (IMPROVE). The programme has a major focus on stillbirth and is delivered as six interactive skills -based stations. We aimed to determine participants ' pre- and post-programme knowledge of and confidence in the management of perinatal deaths, along with satisfaction with the programme. We also aimed to determine suitability for international use. The IMPROVE programme was delivered to health professionals in maternity hospitals in all seven Australian states and territories and modified for use internationally with piloting in Vietnam, Fiji, and the Netherlands (with the assistance of the International Stillbirth Alliance, ISA). Modifications were made to programme materials in consultation with local teams and included translation for the Vietnam programme. Participants completed pre- and post-programme evaluation questionnaires on knowledge and confidence on six key components of perinatal death management as well as a satisfaction questionnaire. Over the period May 2012 to May 2015, 30 IMPROVE workshops were conducted, including 26 with 758 participants in Australia and four with 136 participants internationally. Evaluations showed a significant improvement between pre- and post-programme knowledge and confidence in all six stations and overall, and a high degree of satisfaction in all settings. The IMPROVE programme has been well received in Australia and in three different international settings and is now being made available through ISA. Future research is required to determine whether the immediate improvements in knowledge are sustained with less causes of death being classified as unknown, changes in clinical practice and improvement in parents' experiences with care.

Employing a hermeneutic -phenomenological approach, eight service users were interviewed about their expectations for treatment and their goals and hopes for recovery at the start of their contact with health professionals at a CMHC. Two years later, they were re-interviewed about their experiences of treatment and support from the health professionals in their work towards these goals and hopes. A collaborative approach was adopted. A co-researcher with lived experience took part in all stages of the study. Data were analysed by means of a data -driven stepwise approach in line with thematic analysis. Five themes reflecting how participants experienced support from health professionals at the CMHC in their work towards their recovery goals were elicited, as follows: developing an understanding of oneself and one's mental health problems; learning how to change feelings and behaviours; being 'pushed' into social arenas; finding helpful medication; and counselling in family, practical and financial issues. The participants ' expectations about counselling with regard to longer-term family, practical, and financial challenges were insufficiently met by the CMHC. In the experience of the service users, recovery occurred within the context of their everyday life with or without the support of their professional helpers. To facilitate recovery, health professionals should acknowledge the service user's personal goals and hopes and take a more comprehensive and longer-term approach to his or her needs and desires.

HDFN is most often caused by anti-D but may also occur due to anti-K, -c - or -E. We recently found N-linked glycosylation of anti-D to be skewed towards low fucosylation, thereby increasing the affinity to IgG-Fc receptor IIIa and IIIb, which correlated with HDFN disease severity. Here, we analysed 230 pregnant women with anti-c, -E or -K alloantibodies from a prospective screening cohort and investigated the type of Fc-tail glycosylation of these antibodies in relation to the trigger of immunisation and pregnancy outcome. Anti-c, -E and -K show - independent of the event that had led to immunisation - a different kind of Fc-glycosylation compared to that of the total IgG fraction, but with less pronounced differences compared to anti-D. High Fc-galactosylation and sialylation of anti-c correlated with HDFN disease severity, while low anti-K Fc-fucosylation correlated with severe fetal anaemia. IgG-Fc glycosylation of anti-RBC antibodies is shaped depending on the antigen.

The S2 subunit of the spike glycoprotein from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) contains internal domains called fusion peptides (FP) that play essential roles in virus entry. Although membrane fusion has been broadly studied, there are still major gaps in the molecular details of lipid rearrangements in the bilayer during fusion peptide - membrane interactions. Here we employed differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and electron spin resonance (ESR) to gather information on the membrane fusion mechanism promoted by two putative SARS FPs. DSC data showed the peptides strongly perturb the structural integrity of anionic vesicles and support the hypothesis that the peptides generate opposing curvature stresses on phosphatidylethanolamine membranes. ESR showed that both FPs increase lipid packing and head group ordering as well as reduce the intramembrane water content for anionic membranes. Therefore, bending moment in the bilayer could be generated, promoting negative curvature. The significance of the ordering effect, membrane dehydration, changes in the curvature properties and the possible role of negatively charged phospholipids in helping to overcome the high kinetic barrier involved in the different stages of the SARS - CoV -mediated membrane fusion are discussed."}

The bioactivity of Ereb was investigated, and it was found to inhibit molting when fed to the arthropod species Orchomene plebs. Xanthurenic acid (XA) is a known endogenous molt regulator present in arthropods. Experimental studies have confirmed that XA inhibits molting by binding to either (or both) of two P450 enzymes (CYP315a1 or CYP314a1) that are responsible for the final two hydroxylations in the production of the molt-inducing hormone, 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E). The lack of crystal structures and biochemical assays for CYP315a1 or CYP314a1, has prevented further experimental exploration of XA and Ereb's molt inhibition mechanisms. Herein, a wide array of computational techniques - homology modeling, molecular dynamics simulations, binding site bioinformatics, flexible receptor-flexible ligand docking, and molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area calculations - have been employed to elucidate the structure-function relationships between the aforementioned P450s and the two described small molecule inhibitors (Ereb and XA). Results indicate that Ereb likely targets CYP315a1 by interacting with a network of aromatic residues in the binding site, while XA may inhibit both CYP315a1 and CYP314a1 because of its aromatic, as well as charged nature."}

The aim of the present study was to examine and memorialize this important assemblage. To this end, we were allowed to sample the head hair of six such preparations for toxicological analysis. By means of high performance liquid chromatography, cocaine and its main metabolite, benzoylecgonine, were detected in two out of six hair samples. The concentrations for cocaine were 0.151 and 0.09ng/mg and for benzoylecgonine 0.103 and 0.147ng/mg, respectively. Given that cocaine was a commonly used medicine, beginning in the mid-19th century and persisting into the 20th century, it is not surprising that some patients may have ingested this drug. In addition to the detection of cocaine, these analyses also provided evidence of nicotine and caffeine intake."}

For cancerous tissues, the greatest difficulty is the absorption peaks of various substances contained in tissues overlap with each other, which are hard to identify and quantitative analyze. As a result, it is very hard to measure the presence of cancer cell and then to diagnose accurately. In this paper, we select three typical neurotransmitters (\u03b3-aminobutyric acid, L-glutamic acid, dopamine hydrochloride) and two typical metabolites (inositol and creatine) in neurons to measure their terahertz spectra with different mixture ratios. By choosing characteristic absorption peaks, removing baseline and using the least square method, we can identify the components and proportions of each mixture, where the goodness of fit to practical situation is up to 94%. These results provide important evidences for identifying nerve substances and obtaining exact quantitative analysis."}

We designed a retrospective cohort study in which we retrospectively studied medical charts of female and male patients of BEEC who had undergone CaHA or Deflux injection for continence improvement between 2009 and 2014. Sixteen incontinent patients with a mean \u00b1 SD age of 8.09 \u00b1 3.5 years received an endoscopic submucosal injection of 5.4 ml of pure CaHA powder with autologous plasma (group A). Patients in group B (N = 21), control group, with a mean \u00b1 SD age of 7.51 \u00b1 2.8 years received Deflux injection (5.1 ml). The mean follow-up after injection was 38 \u00b1 5.2 and 33 \u00b1 4.1 months in groups A and B, respectively. No post-injection complication was detected in none of the patients during the follow-up. Eleven patients (68.75%) in group A became socially dry following 1-2 injections, the degree of incontinence was improved in 4 patients (25%), and there was no change in one patient (6.25%). However, Deflux injection resulted in complete dryness in 14 (66.66%), improvement in the degree of incontinence in 5 (23.81%) and no change in 2 patients (9.52%), leading to no significant difference in continence achievement between CaHA and Deflux groups (p = 0.9). The statistical analysis was not significantly different in terms of bladder capacity (p = 0.7) or Q max (p = 0.8). The preliminary results of this study revealed that CaHA may be applied as an affordable bulking agent in treatment of urinary incontinence in BEEC."}

To determine the potential use of endocrine fertility traits in genomic evaluations, the improvement in accuracy from using endocrine fertility traits concurrent with classical traits in the genomic prediction of fertility was quantified. The impact of recording all traits on all training animals was also investigated. Endocrine and classical fertility records were available on 5,339 lactations from 2,447 Holstein cows in Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. The endocrine traits were commencement of luteal activity (C-LA) and proportion of samples with luteal activity (PLA); the classical trait was the interval from calving to first service (CFS). The interval from C-LA to first service (C-LAFS), which is a combination of an endocrine trait and a classical trait, was also investigated. The target (breeding goal) trait for fertility was CFS or C-LAFS, whereas C-LA and PLA served as predictor traits. Genomic EBV (GEBV) for fertility were derived using genomic BLUP in bivariate models with 85,485 SNP. Genomic EBV for the separate fertility traits were also computed, in univariate models. The accuracy of GEBV was evaluated by 5-fold cross-validation. The highest accuracy of GEBV was achieved using bivariate predictions, where both an endocrine fertility trait and the classical fertility trait were used. Accuracy of GEBV for predicting adjusted phenotypes for CFS in the univariate model was 0.04, but when predicting CFS using a bivariate model with C-LA, the accuracy increased to 0.14 when all training animals were phenotyped for C-LA and (or not) for CFS.

Nevertheless, the exploitation of microfluidic platforms for their controlled and continuous production is still missing. Here, a microfluidic platform is used to synthesize crosslinked Hyaluronic Acid NanoParticles (cHANPs) in which a clinically relevant MRI - CAs, gadolinium diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid (Gd-DTPA), is entrapped. This microfluidic process facilitates a high degree of control over particle synthesis, enabling the production of monodisperse particles as small as 35 nm. Furthermore, the interference of Gd-DTPA during polymer precipitation is overcome by finely tuning process parameters and leveraging the use of hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) of surfactants and pH conditions. For both production strategies proposed to design Gd -loaded cHANPs, a boosting of the relaxation rate T1 is observed since a T1 of 1562 is achieved with a 10 \u03bcM of Gd -loaded cHANPs while a similar value is reached with 100 \u03bcM of the relevant clinical Gd-DTPA in solution. The advanced microfluidic platform to synthesize intravascularly - injectable and completely biocompatible hydrogel nanoparticles entrapping clinically approved CAs enables the implementation of straightforward and scalable strategies in diagnostics and therapy applications."}

In the active state, the catalytic core oscillates between open, intermediate, and closed conformations. Currently, the intramolecular interactions that regulate the active state mechanics are not well understood. Here, using cAMP-dependent protein kinase as a representative model coupled with biochemical, biophysical, and computational techniques, we define a set of highly conserved electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions working harmoniously to regulate these mechanics. These include the previously identified salt bridge between a lysine from the \u03b23-strand and a glutamate from the \u03b1C-helix as well as an electrostatic interaction between the phosphorylated activation loop and \u03b1C-helix and an ensemble of hydrophobic residues of the Regulatory spine and Shell. Moreover, for over three decades it was thought that the highly conserved \u03b23 -lysine was essential for phosphoryl transfer, but our findings show that the \u03b23 -lysine is not required for phosphoryl transfer but is essential for the active state mechanics."}

While most studies focus on the long-term morbidity and adverse radiation effects (AREs), none describe the acute clinical AREs that might appear on a short-term basis. These types of events are investigated, and their incidence, type, and outcomes are reported in the present paper. METHODS The included patients were treated between July 2010 and March 2016, underwent at least 6 months of follow-up, and presented with a disabling symptom during the first 6 months after GKS that affected their quality of life. The timing of appearance, as well as the type of main symptom and outcome, were noted. The prescribed dose was 12 Gy at the margin. RESULTS Thirty-five (22%) of 159 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria had acute clinical AREs. The mean followup period was 30 months (range 6-49.2 months). The mean time of appearance was 37.9 days (median 31 days; range 3-110 days). In patients with de novo symptoms, the more frequent symptoms were vertigo (n = 4; 11.4%) and gait disturbance (n = 3; 8.6%). The exacerbation of a preexisting symptom was more frequently related to hearing loss (n = 10; 28.6%), followed by gait disturbance (n = 7; 20%) and vertigo (n = 3, 8.6%). In the univariate logistic regression analysis, the following factors were statistically significant: age (p = 0.002; odds ratio [OR] 0.96), hearing at baseline by Gardner-Robertson (GR) class (p = 0.006; OR 0.21), pure tone average at baseline (p = 0.006; OR 0.97), and Koos grade at baseline (with Koos Grade I used as a reference) (for Koos Grade II, OR 0.17 and p = 0.002; for Koos Grade III, OR 0.42 and p = 0.05).

Fractional polynomial regression analysis showed a nonlinear relationship between the outcome and the radiation dose rate (minimum reached at a cutoff of 2.5 Gy/minute) and the maximal vestibular dose (maximum reached at a cutoff of 8 Gy), but the small sample size precludes a detailed analysis of the former. The clinical acute AREs disappeared in 32 (91.4%) patients during the first 6 months after appearance. Permanent and somewhat disabling morbidity was found in 3 cases (1.9% from the whole series): 1 each with complete hearing loss (GR Class I before and V after), hemifacial spasm (persistent but alleviated), and dysgeusia. CONCLUSIONS Acute effects after radiosurgery for VS are not rare. They concern predominantly de novo vertigo and gait disturbance and the exacerbation of preexistent hearing loss. In de novo vestibular symptom s, a vestibular dose of more than 8 Gy is thought to play a role. In most cases, none of these effects are permanent, and they will ultimately improve or disappear with steroid therapy. Permanent AREs remain very rare."}

In experimental models SCD1 is down-regulated by polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), but clinical studies are scarce. The effect of long-chain n-3 PUFA (LCn-3PUFA) supplied by the regular diet, in the absence of fatty fish or fish oil supplementation, remains to be explored. We related 1-y changes in plasma SCD1 index, as assessed by the C16:1n-7 / C16:0 ratio, to both adiposity traits and nutrient intake changes in a sub-cohort (n = 243) of non-hypertriglyceridemic subjects of the PREDIMED (PREvenci\u00f3n con DIeta MEDiterranea) trial.

We examined expression of three interneuron precursor transcription factors, alongside other markers, using immunohistochemistry on 8-12 post-conceptional weeks (PCW) human telencephalon sections. NKX2.1, OLIG2, and COUP-TFII expression occupied distinct (although overlapping) neurogenic domains which extended into the cortex and revealed three CGE compartments: lateral, medial, and ventral. NKX2.1 expression was very largely confined to the MGE, medial CGE, and ventral septum confirming that, at this developmental stage, interneuron generation from NKX2.1 + precursor s closely resembles the process observed in rodents. OLIG2 immunoreactivity was observed in GABAergic cells of the proliferative zones of the MGE and septum, but not necessarily co-expressed with NKX2.1, and OLIG2 expression was also extensively seen in the LGE, CGE, and cortex. At 8 PCW, OLIG2 + cells were only present in the medial and anterior cortical wall suggesting a migratory pathway for interneuron precursor s via the septum into the medial cortex. By 12 PCW, OLIG2 + cells were present throughout the cortex and many were actively dividing but without co-expressing cortical progenitor markers. Dividing COUP-TFII + progenitor cells were localized to ventral CGE as previously described but were also numerous in adjacent ventral cortex; in both the cases, COUP-TFII was co-expressed with PAX6 in proliferative zones and TBR1 or calretinin in post- mitotic cortical neurons. Thus COUP-TFII + progenitors gave rise to pyramidal cells, but also interneurons which not only migrated posteriorly into the cortex from ventral CGE but also anteriorly via the LGE."}

Evidence exists for both compression and delay of mortality. Existing parametric models to describe the full age pattern of mortality are not able to capture mortality delay versus mortality compression. More recent models that assess delay versus compression mostly focused on the adult or old ages alone and did not distinguish mortality compression below and above the modal age at death, although they represent different mechanisms. This paper presents a new parametric model that describes the full age pattern of mortality and assesses compression - at different stages of life - and delay of mortality: the CoDe model. The model includes 10 parameters, of which five are constant over time. The five time -varying parameters reflect delay of mortality and compression of mortality in infancy, adolescence, young adulthood, late adulthood, and old age. The model describes infant and background mortality by two simple functions, uses a mixed logistic model with different slopes in adult, middle, and old age, and includes the modal age at death as a parameter to account for the delay in mortality. Applying the CoDe model to age - specific probabilities of death for Japanese, French, American, and Danish men and women between 1950 and 2010 showed a very good fit of the full age pattern of mortality. Delay of mortality explained about two-thirds of the increase in life expectancy at birth, whereas compression of mortality due to mortality declines in young age explained about one-third. No strong compression of mortality in late adulthood age was observed. Mortality compression in old age has had a small negative impact on life expectancy. The CoDe model proved a valid instrument for describing the full age pattern of mortality and for disentangling the effects of mortality delay and compression - at different stages of life - on the increase in life expectancy."}

For that reason, we have estimated its prevalence through the registration of patients who had used thyroid hormones in Andalusia (South Spain). Data of patients who had withdrawn levothyroxine under the public system during 2014 from the base of the Andalusian Health Service were considered. Prevalence were calculated with confidence intervals of 95% for each management area, stratified by sex and age groups, and differences between them were evaluated. 321,368 people (98% older than 18 years and 83% female) were identified as levothyroxine users and a prevalence of hypothyroidism of 3.95% (95% CI :3.94-3.96) was estimated for the general population. The condition was more common in females, in the older 18 years 7.81% (95% CI :7.80 to 7.82) compared to males 1.75% (95% CI :1.73-1.77) with a ratio of 4.5-fold. It increases in the population of women older than 45 years, 10.32% (95% CI :10.30-0.32) and in the over 60 years 11.37% (95% CI: 11.35-11.40). The prevalence in adult women in the western provinces is 7.38% (95% CI :7.36-7.40), in the eastern provinces 8.59% (95% CI :8.57-8.62) and in coastal areas 6.70% (95% CI: 6.68-6.72) compared to the mountainous ones, which is 8.91% (95% CI :8.88-8.94).

This prompted our investigation of the mortality rate, cause of death, and incidence of acute CV events in patients from northern Sweden with PsA. Patients with established PsA (464) were included. To calculate standardized mortality ratio (SMR) and standardized incidence ratio (SIR) for CV events, data were extracted from the National Causes of Death Register and the National Inpatient Care Register in Sweden, and compared with the general population. The study period was 1995-2011. To study the effect of inflammatory activity, a composite disease activity index (DAI) was used. The SMR (95% CI) for overall mortality and diseases of the circulatory system (International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition; I00-I99) was 1.22 (0.89-1.63) and 1.64 (1.02-2.52), respectively. In regression analysis, DAI was significantly associated with death (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.41-2.80) when adjusted for age and sex (p < 0.001), and remained significant after stratifying patients into the 2 major causes of death: diseases of the circulatory system and malignant neoplasms.

The SIR (95% CI) for a CV event (myocardial infarction or stroke) was 0.597 (0.40-0.86); this association was only significant in men. Patients with PsA had a small but significant increase in SMR for death due to diseases of the circulatory system compared with the general population. Among patients, death was associated with DAI, as well as axial involvement in combination with peripheral disease, indicating more aggressive disease phenotypes."}

The HPD was prepared to 250-500 \u00b5m in size. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were performed to confirm the crystal structure, organic compound residues, and surface morphology, respectively. Bony defects were created on the heads of 24 New Zealand White rabbits. Sterilized HPD was used as the grafting material. The quality and quantity of new bone formation was evaluated using micro-CT and histologic analyses during the 8 week experimental periods. For microarray assay, bone tissue and blood samples were taken at 3, 5 and 7 d post-implantation. The results of XRD and EDX showed that HPD exhibited physical and chemical properties similar to natural hydroxyapatite. New bone formation was observed after HPD implantation compared to the controls, as shown on hematoxylin and eosin staining and micro-CT. The bone volume of HPD treated animals was higher than that of the control group at all observation times. Microarray analysis showed that vascular development coupled with immune and inflammatory related genes were expressed in the early healing stage. The gene coding for the IL-1 antagonist, IL1RN, was expressed to inhibit the inflammatory response, and at the same time, the CCL2 gene was activated to 2.3 times the normal level. BMP2, RUNX2, COL1A, and OPN expression were also up-regulated. CCL2 predominated in osteoblastogenesis of the HPD - treated bony defect in the early stage of healing. HPD accelerated bone regeneration and augmentation. These results suggested that HPD provided potential as a bone graft resource during the bone healing process."}

Trainees comprised UK graduates and International Medical Graduates, across all stages of training in 6 specialties (General Practice, Medicine, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Psychiatry, Radiology, Surgery) and Foundation. Postgraduate training was characterised by work-life imbalance. Long hours at work were typically supplemented with revision and completion of the e-portfolio. Trainees regularly moved workplaces which could disrupt their personal lives and sometimes led to separation from friends and family. This made it challenging to cope with personal pressures, the stresses of which could then impinge on learning and training, while also leaving trainees with a lack of social support outside work to buffer against the considerable stresses of training. Low morale and harm to well-being resulted in some trainees feeling dehumanised. Work-life imbalance was particularly severe for those with children and especially women who faced a lack of less-than - full-time positions and discriminatory attitudes. Female trainees frequently talked about having to choose a specialty they felt was more conducive to a work-life balance such as General Practice. The proposed junior doctor contract was felt to exacerbate existing problems. A lack of work-life balance in postgraduate medical training negatively impacted on trainees ' learning and well-being. Women with children were particularly affected, suggesting this group would benefit the greatest from changes to improve the work-life balance of trainees."}

Although reappraisal, an emotion regulation strategy, is known to effectively modulate subjective experience of emotions, it remains unknown whether reappraisal can alter attentional biases to emotional information. In the current research, we investigated the influence of instruction-induced state reappraisal (Study 1) and trait reappraisal (Study 2) on attentional biases to happy and angry faces. In Study 1, healthy young women were recruited and randomly assigned to one of the three groups: up -, down -, and no-regulation. Participants were instructed to reappraise their emotions to increase and decrease emotional experience while viewing an emotionally negative film clip. Attentional bias was assessed with a dot-probe task with pictures of angry and happy facial expressions. In Study 2, a separate group of healthy young men and women participated. Participants ' trait reappraisal and suppression as well as state and trait anxiety were assessed. A dot-probe task was completed by all participants. Statistical tests in Study 1 revealed that participants who reappraised to decrease negative emotions while viewing an emotionally negative film clip had reduced attentional bias to subsequently presented angry faces compared to participants who reappraised to increase negative emotions. Multiple regression analyses in Study 2 revealed that trait reappraisal predicted slower orienting toward angry faces, whereas state anxiety predicted slower disengagement from angry faces. Interestingly, trait suppression predicted slower disengagement from happy faces. Taken together, these results suggest that both instruction-induced state reappraisal and trait reappraisal are linked to reduced attentional bias to negative information and contribute to better understanding of how everyday emotion regulation styles contribute to attentional processing of emotional information."}

The current research offers a theoretical explanation for this hierarchy, proposing that sexual definitions display graded categorical structure, arising from goodness of membership judgments. Moderation of this graded structure is also predicted, with the focus here on how sexual orientation identity affects sexual definitions. A total of 300 18- to 30- year -old participants completed an online survey, rating 18 behaviors for how far each constitutes having \" had sex \" and virginity loss. Participants fell into one of four groups: heterosexual male or female, gay male or lesbian. The predicted ratings hierarchy emerged, in which bidirectional genital acts were rated significantly higher than unidirectional or nonpenetrative contact, which was in turn rated significantly higher than acts involving no genital contact. Moderation of graded structure was also in line with predictions. Compared to the other groups, the lesbian group significantly upgraded ratings of genital contact that was either unidirectional or nonpenetrative. There was also evidence of upgrading by the gay male sample of anal intercourse ratings.

The control group was fed a basal diet containing fresh fish oil, and the other two groups received the same diet except for the substitution with the same dosage of oxidized fish oil alone or with ISF (oxidized fish oil plus ISF). After 21 d of feeding, supplementation of oxidized fish oil increased the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-2 (IL-2), nuclear factor \u03ba B (NF-\u03baB), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), NO, and Caspase-3 in jejunal mucosa, and decreased the villous height in duodenum and the levels of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) and IL-4 in the jejunal mucosa compared with supplementation with fresh oil. The addition of oxidized fish oil plus ISF partially alleviated this negative effect. The addition of oxidized fish oil plus ISF increased the villous height and levels of sIgA and IL-4 in jejunal mucosa, but decreased the levels of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-2 in jejunal mucosa (P<0.05) compared with oxidized fish oil. Collectively, these results show that dietary supplementation of ISF could partly alleviate the negative effect of oxidized fish oil by improving the intestinal morphology as well as the antioxidant capacity and immune function in young piglets."}

Hypoglycemic burden correlates with adverse cardiovascular complications and contributes acutely and chronically to endothelial dysfunction. Prior data indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to hypoglycemia - induced endothelial dysfunction, but the mechanisms behind this linkage remain unknown. We attempt to determine whether clinically relevant low-glucose (LG) exposures acutely induce endothelial dysfunction through activation of the mitochondrial fission process. Characterization of mitochondrial morphology was carried out in cultured endothelial cells by using confocal microscopy. Isolated human arterioles were used to explore the effect LG - induced mitochondrial fission has on the formation of detrimental reactive oxygen species (ROS), bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO), and endothelial-dependent vascular relaxation. Fluorescence microscopy was employed to visualize changes in mitochondrial ROS and NO levels and videomicroscopy applied to measure vasodilation response. Pharmacological disruption of the profission protein Drp1 with Mdivi-1 during LG exposure reduced mitochondrial fragmentation among vascular endothelial cells (LG: 0.469; LG + Mdivi-1: 0.276; P = 0.003), prevented formation of vascular ROS (LG: 2.036; LG + Mdivi-1: 1.774; P = 0.005), increased the presence of NO (LG: 1.352; LG + Mdivi-1: 1.502; P = 0.048), and improved vascular dilation response to acetylcholine (LG: 31.6%; LG + Mdivi-1; 78.5% at maximum dose; P < 0.001).

It is a complex and heterogeneous disease with different clinical outcomes. Stratifying patients into subgroups with different outcomes could help guide clinical decision making. In this study, we used two opposing groups of genes, Yin and Yang, to develop a prognostic expression ratio signature. Using the METABRIC cohort we identified a16- gene signature capable of stratifying breast cancer patients into four risk levels with intention that low-risk patients would not undergo adjuvant systemic therapy, intermediate - low-risk patients will be treated with hormonal therapy only, and intermediate -high- and high-risk groups will be treated by chemotherapy in addition to the hormonal therapy. The 16- gene signature for four risk level stratifications of breast cancer patients has been validated using 14 independent datasets. Notably, the low-risk group (n = 51) of 205 estrogen receptor-positive and node negative (ER+ / node-) patients from three different datasets who had not had any systemic adjuvant therapy had 100% 15- year disease-specific survival rate. The Concordance Index of YMR for ER+ / node negative patients is close to the commercially available signatures. However, YMR showed more significance (HR = 3.7, p = 8.7e-12) in stratifying ER+ / node- subgroup than OncotypeDx (HR = 2.7, p = 1.3e-7), MammaPrint (HR = 2.5, p = 5.8e-7), rorS (HR = 2.4, p = 1.4e-6), and NPI (HR = 2.6, p = 1.2e-6).

The aim of this study was to obtain an accurate assessment on the relationship between stereotypies and neurodevelopmental disorders. We studied 23 children (3 girls), aged 36-95 months, who requested a consultation due to the persistence or increased severity of motor stereotypies. None of the patients had a previous diagnosis of ASD. The assessment included the Motor Severity Stereotypy Scale (MSSS), the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R), the Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices, the Child Behavior CheckList for ages 1\u00bd-5 or 4-18 (CBCL), the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-second edition (ADOS 2). All patients were showing motor stereotypies for periods of time varying from 6 to 77 months. The MSSS showed that each child had a limited number of stereotypies; their frequency and intensity were mild. The interference of stereotypies was variable; the impairment in daily life was mild. The RBS-R scores were positive for the subscale of \" stereotypic behaviors \" in all children. Moreover, several children presented other repetitive behaviors, mainly \" ritualistic behavior \" and \" sameness behavior .\" All patients showed a normal cognitive level. The CBCL evidenced behavioral problems in 22% of the children: internalizing problems, attention, and withdrawn were the main complaints. On the SRS, all but one of the tested patients obtained clinical scores in the clinical range for at least one area. On the ADOS 2, 4 patients obtained scores indicating a moderate level of ASD symptoms, 4 had a mild level, and 15 showed no or minimal signs of ASD.

The objective of this study was to analyze the biomechanical effects of these sitting strategies on lumbar-pelvic angles. Twenty able-bodied participants were recruited for the study. All participants performed LPDS, BRDS, FUDS, LBDS, LFDS, BFDS, and LBFDS in a random order. All lumbar-pelvic angle parameters, including the static lumbar angle, static pelvic angle, lumbar range of motion, and pelvic range of motion were measured and compared. Results show that LBDS and LBFDS enabled the most beneficial lumbar movements, although the difference between the 2 strategies was nonsignificant. BRDS and BFDS enabled the most beneficial pelvic movements, although the difference between the 2 strategies was nonsignificant. Among all the upright DSSs, LPDS and LFDS enabled the most beneficial lumbar and pelvic movements, although no significant difference was observed between these 2 strategies. We identified the effects and differences among 7 DSSs on lumbar-pelvic angles. Wheelchair users can choose the most suitable DSS that meets their needs.

Therefore, the global transcriptome profiles of DADS - treated tomato roots over time were investigated to reveal the potential growth-promoting mechanisms. We detected 1828, 1296 and 1190 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the 4, 24 and 48 h samples, respectively. Most DEGs involved in assimilatory sulfate reduction and glutathione metabolism were up-regulated after short-term (4 h) DADS treatment. In addition, increased activity of defensive enzymes and up-regulation of six peroxidase genes were observed, suggesting that DADS could induce tomato resistance. In plant-pathogen interactions, DEGs related to calcium signaling were primarily inhibited, while those encoding pathogenesis-related proteins were primarily up-regulated. Although plant hormone synthesis and signal transduction were both significantly affected by DADS, the expression trends of the genes in these two pathways were conflicting.

However, mitotic phosphotyrosine is not well characterized. Although a few functionally - relevant mitotic phosphotyrosine sites have been characterized, evidence suggests that this modification may be more prevalent than previously appreciated. Here, we examined tyrosine phosphorylation in mitotic human cells including those on spindle-associated proteins .? Database mining confirmed ~2000 mitotic phosphotyrosine sites, and network analysis revealed a number of subnetworks that were enriched in tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, including components of the kinetochore or spindle and SRC family kinases. We identified Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), a major signaling hub in the spindle subnetwork, as phosphorylated at the conserved Tyr(217) in the kinase domain. Substitution of Tyr(217) with a phosphomimetic residue eliminated PLK1 activity in vitro and in cells. Further analysis showed that Tyr(217) phosphorylation reduced the phosphorylation of Thr(210) in the activation loop, a phosphorylation event necessary for PLK1 activity.

We have solved this issue by applying the divided and sliding flap technique, which was first reported for primary donor-site closure of a latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap. We applied this technique to the hair-bearing STA flap, where primary donor-site closure is extremely beneficial for preventing baldness consequent to skin grafting.

This mitohormetic effect is thought to involve the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR(mt)), an adaptive stress-response pathway activated by mitochondrial proteotoxic stress. Using mice with skeletal muscle-specific deficiency of Crif1 (muscle-specific knockout [MKO]), an integral protein of the large mitoribosomal subunit (39S), we identified growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) as a UPR(mt) -associated cell-non-autonomous myomitokine that regulates systemic energy homeostasis. MKO mice were protected against obesity and sensitized to insulin, an effect associated with elevated GDF15 secretion after UPR(mt) activation. In ob/ob mice, administration of recombinant GDF15 decreased body weight and improved insulin sensitivity, which was attributed to elevated oxidative metabolism and lipid mobilization in the liver, muscle, and adipose tissue. Thus, GDF15 is a potent mitohormetic signal that safeguards against the onset of obesity and insulin resistance."}

These complexes are considered promising biomaterial carrier since the guest molecules can be released later, leading to many applications, especially in the pharmaceutical industry. Rifampicin (RIF) has long been recognized as an active drug against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, however, the administration of RIF in high dosages can originate unwanted side-effects. Due to the fact that the use of native amylose (AM) in the formation of complexes is limited by their low water solubility, it was acetylated with a medium degree of substitution (DS), allowing solubilizing (0.5gL(-1)) acetylated amylose (AMA) in water at neutral pH, in opposition to that observed with native amylose (trace solubility). The resulting acetylated amylose was characterized by means of Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). FT-IR results indicated that the acetylation of anhydroglucose units of amylose corresponds to a low DS, whereas SEM results suggested that the smooth surfaces of amylose granules were changed into rougher surfaces after acetylation. Ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy (UV-vis) analysis confirmed the formation and allowed the quantification of both native (AM - RIF) and acetylated (AMA - RIF) amylose inclusion complexes. Their characterization in solution was performed by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and zeta potential (ZP) measurements. The average size of inclusion complexes as determined by DLS, ranged between 70 and 100nm. Besides, ZP analysis showed that both complexes are more stable in the presence of RIF. This study may lead to the development of an effective method for the preparation of amylose inclusion complexes, which is beneficial to their further application in drug delivery systems."}

It would seem then that selection is an important component controlling the animal's action. But, we may ask, is the selection process in such cases impervious to the presence of other objects that could constitute potential obstacles to or constraints on movement execution? And if it is, in fact, pervious to other objects, do they have a direct influence on the organization of the response? The kinematics of macaques ' reaching movements were examined by the current study that analysed some exemplars as they selectively reached to grasp a food item in the absence as well as in the presence of potential obstacles (i.e., stones) that could affect the arm trajectory. Changes in movement parameterization were noted in temporal measures, such as movement time, as well as in spatial ones, such as paths of trajectory. Generally speaking, the presence of stones in the vicinity of the acting hand stalled the reaching movement and affected the arm trajectory as the hand veered away from the stone even when it was not a physical obstacle. We concluded that nearby objects evoke a motor response in macaques, and the attentional mechanisms that allow for a successful action selection are revealed in the reaching path. The data outlined here concur with human studies indicating that potential obstacles are internally represented, a finding implying basic cognitive operations allowing for action selection in macaques."}

In the presence of non-rigid anatomical changes, it is often not obvious which patient position is most suitable. Thus, dose -guided patient alignment is an interesting approach to use available in-room imaging data for up-to-date dose calculation, aimed at finding the position that yields the optimal dose distribution. This contribution presents the first implementation of dose -guided patient alignment as multi-criteria optimization problem. User-defined clinical objectives are employed for setting up a multi-objective problem. Using pre-calculated dose distributions at a limited number of patient shifts and dose interpolation, a continuous space of Pareto-efficient patient shifts becomes accessible. Pareto sliders facilitate interactive browsing of the possible shifts with real-time dose display to the user. Dose interpolation accuracy is validated and the potential of multi-objective dose-guided positioning demonstrated for three head and neck (H&N) and three prostate cancer patients. Dose-guided positioning is compared to replanning for all cases. A delineated replanning CT served as surrogate for in-room imaging data. Dose interpolation accuracy was high. Using a [Formula: see text] dose difference criterion, a median pass-rate of 95.7% for H&N and 99.6% for prostate cases was determined in a comparison to exact dose calculations. For all patients, dose-guided positioning allowed to find a clinically preferable dose distribution compared to bony anatomy based alignment. For all H&N cases, mean dose to the spared parotid glands was below [Formula: see text] (up to [Formula: see text] with bony alignment) and clinical target volume (CTV) [Formula: see text] above 99.1% (compared to 95.1%).

Although it is a minimally invasive treatmen t, it is associated with complications, the most common being pneumothorax. Pneumothorax occurs due to the rapid target lobe volume reduction and may be a predictor of clinical benefit despite this complication. The objective of this study was to conduct an exploratory data analysis of patients who developed a pneumothorax following endoscopic valve therapy for emphysema. This study performed a retrospective evaluation of pneumothorax management and the impact of pneumothorax on clinical outcomes in 70 patients following valve therapy in 381 consecutive patients. Pneumothorax rate following valve therapy was 18%. Pneumothorax management consisted of chest tube insertion, valve removal, and surgical intervention in 87% (61/70), 44% (31/70), and 19% (13/70) of the patients, respectively. Despite pneumothorax, patients experienced modest but significant improvements in lung function parameters (forced expiratory volume in 1 second: 55\u00b1148 mL, residual volume: -390\u00b1964 mL, total lung capacity: -348\u00b1876; all P<0.05). Persistent lobar atelectasis 3 months after recovering from pneumothorax, which was associated with relevant clinical improvement, was observed in only 21% (15/70) of the patients. Pneumothorax is a frequent severe complication following valve therapy that requires further intervention. Nevertheless, the pneumothorax does not impair the clinical status in the majority of patients. Patients with lobar atelectasis benefit after recovering from pneumothorax in terms of lung function parameters."}

For that purpose, real-time auditory feedback of physiological and physical information based on sound signals, often termed \" sonification ,\" has been proven particularly useful. However, the use of music in biofeedback systems has been much less explored. In the current article, we assert that the use of music, and musical principles, can have a major added value, on top of mere sound signals, to the benefit of psychological and physical optimization of sports and motor rehabilitation tasks. In this article, we present the 3Mo model to describe three main functions of music that contribute to these benefits. These functions relate the power of music to Motivate, and to Monitor and Modify physiological and physical processes. The model brings together concepts and theories related to human sensorimotor interaction with music, and specifies the underlying psychological and physiological principles. This 3Mo model is intended to provide a conceptual framework that guides future research on musical biofeedback systems in the domain of sports and motor rehabilitation. Journal"}

Aneurysm rupture itself initiates global cerebral edema in up to two thirds of cases. Although cerebral edema is not a universal feature of aSAH, it portends a poor clinical course, with quantitative analysis revealing a direct correlation between cerebral edema and poor outcome, including mortality and cognitive deficits. Mechanistically, global cerebral edema has been linked to global ischemia at the time of aneurysm rupture, dysfunction of autoregulation, blood breakdown products, neuroinflammation, and hyponatremia / endocrine abnormalities. At a molecular level, several culprits have been identified, including aquaporin-4, matrix metalloproteinase-9, SUR1 - TRPM4 cation channels, vascular endothelial growth factor, bradykinin, and others. Here, we review these cellular and molecular mechanisms of global cerebral edema formation in aSAH. Given the importance of edema to the outcome of patients with aSAH and its status as a highly modifiable pathological process, a better understanding of cerebral edema in aSAH promises to hasten the development of medical therapies to improve outcomes in this frequently devastating disease."}

Here we hypothesize that biliary phospholipid flow could directly contribute to the proliferative power of normal and dysplastic enterocytes. We used Abcb4 (-/-) mice which lack biliary phospholipid secretion. We first show that Abcb4 (-/-) mice are protected against intestinal tumorigenesis. At the molecular level, the transcriptional activity of the nuclear receptor Liver Receptor Homolog-1 (Lrh1) is reduced in Abcb4 (-/-) mice and its re-activation re-establishes a tumor burden comparable to control mice. Feeding Abcb4 (-/-) mice a diet supplemented with phospholipids completely overcomes the intestinal tumor protective phenotype, thus corroborating the hypothesis that the absence of biliary phospholipids and not lack of Abcb4 gene per se is responsible for the protection. In turn, phospholipids cannot re-establish intestinal tumorigenesis in Abcb4 (-/-) mice crossed with mice with intestinal specific ablation of Lrh1, a nuclear hormone receptor that is activates by phospholipids. Our data identify the key role of biliary phospholipids in sustaining intestinal mucosa proliferation and tumor progression through the activation of nuclear receptor Lrh1."}

Meprin alpha (Mep1A) is a secreted metalloproteinase with many substrates relevant to cancer invasion. We found that Mep1A was a target of Reptin, a protein that is oncogenic in HCC. We studied Mep1A regulation by Reptin, its role in HCC, and whether it mediates Reptin oncogenic effects. MepA and Reptin expression was measured in human HCC by qRT-PCR and in cultured cells by PCR, western blot and enzymatic activity measurements. Cell growth was assessed by counting and MTS assay. Cell migration was measured in Boyden chambers and wound healing assays, and cell invasion in Boyden chambers. Silencing Reptin decreased Mep1A expression and activity, without affecting meprin \u03b2. Mep1A, but not meprin \u03b2, was overexpressed in a series of 242 human HCC (2.04 fold, p < 0.0001), and a high expression correlated with a poor prognosis. Mep1A and Reptin expressions were positively correlated (r = 0.39, p < 0.0001). Silencing Mep1A had little effect on cell proliferation, but decreased cell migration and invasion of HuH7 and Hep3B cells. Conversely, overexpression of Mep1A or addition of recombinant Mep1A increased migration and invasion. Finally, overexpression of Mep1A restored a normal cell migration in cells where Reptin was depleted. Mep1A is overexpressed in most HCC and induces HCC cell migration and invasion. Mep1A expression is regulated by Reptin, and Mep1A mediates Reptin - induced migration. Overall, we suggest that Mep1A may be a useful target in HCC."}

A population - based dataset was created via linkage between the BC Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS and PopulationDataBC. PLHIV aged 20 years and older were compared to a random 10% sample of the adult general population. The International Classification of Diseases 9 and 10 codes were used to classify unintentional and intentional injuries based on the external cause of the injury from 1996 to 2013. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) Poisson regression models were fit to estimate the effect of HIV status on rates of unintentional and intentional injury, and to identify correlates of injury among PLHIV. The crude incidence rate of unintentional injury was 18.56/1000 person - years [95% confidence interval (CI) 17.77-19.39] among PLHIV and 8.51/1000 person - years (95% CI 8.42-8.59) in the general population. Among PLHIV, 13.45% of deaths were due to injury, compared to 5.52% of deaths in the general population. In adjusted models, PLHIV were more likely to report unintentional (incidence rate ratio 1.42, 95% CI 1.32-1.52) and intentional injury (incidence rate ratio 1.93, 95% CI 1.70-2.18) compared to the general population.

Concomitant heart failure (HF) poses a particular therapeutic challenge and is associated with prolonged atrial electrical refractoriness compared with non-failing hearts. We hypothesized that downregulation of atrial repolarizing TREK-1 (K2P2.1) K(+) channels contributes to electrical remodeling during AF with HF, and that TREK-1 gene transfer would provide rhythm control via normalization of atrial effective refractory periods in this AF subset. In patients with chronic AF and HF, atrial TREK-1 mRNA levels were reduced by 82% (left atrium) and 81% (right atrium) compared with sinus rhythm (SR) subjects. Human findings were recapitulated in a porcine model of atrial tachypacing-induced AF and reduced left ventricular function. TREK-1 mRNA (-66%) and protein (-61%) was suppressed in AF animals at 14-day follow-up compared with SR controls. Downregulation of repolarizing TREK-1 channels was associated with prolongation of atrial effective refractory periods versus baseline conditions, consistent with prior observations in humans with HF. In a preclinical therapeutic approach, pigs were randomized to either atrial Ad-TREK-1 gene therapy or sham treatment. Gene transfer effectively increased TREK-1 protein levels and attenuated atrial effective refractory period prolongation in the porcine AF model. Ad-TREK-1 increased the SR prevalence to 62% during follow-up in AF animals, compared to 35% in the untreated AF group. In conclusion, TREK-1 downregulation and rhythm control by Ad-TREK-1 transfer suggest mechanistic and potential therapeutic significance of TREK-1 channels in a subgroup of AF patients with HF and prolonged atrial effective refractory periods.

The relationship between changes in Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS) scores of pressure-treated scars and differential regulation of elastin was assessed. Hypertrophic scars were created and assessed weekly using VSS and biopsy procurement. Pressure treatment began on day 70 postinjury. Treated scars were compared with untreated shams. Treatment lasted 2 weeks, through day 84, and scars were assessed weekly through day 126. Transcript and protein levels of elastin were quantified. Pressure treatment resulted in lower VSS scores compared with sham-treated scars. Pliability (VSSP) was a key contributor to this difference. At day 70 pretreatment, VSSP = 2. Without treatment, sham-treated scars became less pliable, while pressure-treated scars became more pliable. The percentage of elastin in scars at day 70 was higher than in uninjured skin. Following treatment, the percentage of elastin increased and continued to increase through day 126. Untreated sham scars did not show a similar increase. Quantification of Verhoeff-Van Gieson staining corroborated the findings and immunofluorescence revealed the alignment of elastin fibers. Pressure treatment results in increased protein level expression of elastin compared with sham -untreated scars.

The aim of this study was to determine whether HRS was preserved throughout a 7- week radiotherapy treatment, and also to examine the rate of foci decline and foci persistence between dose fractions. 42 patients with prostate cancer received 7- week fractionated radiotherapy treatment (RT) with daily dose fractions of 0.05-1.10Gy to the skin.

Foci were counted both with digital image analysis and manually. HRS in keratinocytes was evidenced by the dose-response relationships of DSB foci, observed throughout the treatment course, independent of sampling time and quantification method. Foci observed at 24h after dose fractions indicated considerable DSB persistence. Accordingly, foci significantly accumulated after 5 consecutive dose fractions. For doses below 0.3Gy, persistent foci could be observed even at 72h after damage induction.

We evaluated 125 patients who underwent TAVR - planning CTA on 3rd generation DSCT. A two-part protocol was performed including retrospectively ECG-gated coronary CTA (CCTA) and prospectively ECG-triggered aortoiliac CTA using 60mL of contrast medium. Automated tube voltage selection and advanced iterative reconstruction were applied. Effective dose (ED), signal-to-noise (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) were calculated. Five-point scales were used for subjective image quality analysis. In patients who underwent TAVR, sizing parameters were obtained. Image quality was rated good to excellent in 97.6% of CCTA and 100% of aortoiliac CTAs. CTA studies at >100kV showed decreased objective image quality compared to 70-100kV (SNR, all p\u22640.0459; CNR, all p\u22640.0462). Mean ED increased continuously from 70 to >100kV (CCTA: 4.5\u00b11.7mSv-13.6\u00b12.9mSv, all p\u22640.0233; aortoiliac CTA: 2.4\u00b10.9mSv-6.8\u00b12.7mSv, all p\u22640.0414). In 39 patients TAVR was performed and annulus diameter was within the recommended range in all patients. No severe cardiac or vascular complications were noted. 3rd generation DSCT provides diagnostic image quality in TAVR - planning CTA and facilitates reliable assessment of TAVR device and delivery option while reducing radiation dose."}

This is a cross-sectional study conducted in the states of the Northeast region, during the vaccination campaign in 2010. The sample consisted of 2583 mother - child pairs, with children aged from 15 days to 3 months. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale was used to screen for postpartum depression. The outcome was lack of exclusive breastfeeding, defined as the occurrence of this practice in the 24h preceding the interview. Postpartum depression was the explanatory variable of interest and the covariates were: socioeconomic and demographic conditions; maternal health care; prenatal, delivery, and postnatal care; and the child's biological factors. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to control for possible confounding factors. Exclusive breastfeeding was observed in 50.8% of the infants and 11.8% of women had symptoms of postpartum depression. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, a higher chance of exclusive breastfeeding absence was found among mothers with symptoms of postpartum depression (OR=1.67; p<0.001), among younger subjects (OR=1.89; p<0.001), those who reported receiving benefits from the Bolsa Fam\u00edlia Program (OR=1.25; p=0.016), and those started antenatal care later during pregnancy (OR=2.14; p=0.032).

As its appearance was similar to toothpick grooves described in other Homo species, it could correspond to early stages on its formation. To test this hypothesis we developed an experimental replication of a groove using grass stalks. Comparisons between 204 isolated Neandertal teeth and the two experimental dental specimens corroborate that the marks correspond to initial stages of toothpick groove formation, and we propose a five-grade recording scale that summarized the groove formation process. Using this new recording procedure, we found that Hortus individuals have higher incidence of this trait (eight individuals out of nine) than the El Sidr\u00f3n individuals (nine out of 11). Toothpick grooves from El Sidr\u00f3n show the earliest stages of development, whereas the grooves found on Hortus Neandertals were well-developed. Toothpick grooves were also found in 21 incisors and canines. These differences could be due to the more advanced occlusal dental wear in Hortus individuals, maybe age -related and with a more meat -based diet maybe favoring the inclusion of food debris and thus probing as the cleaning methodology. Our results allow the identification and characterization of incipient toothpick grooves on the human fossil record and contribute to increase our knowledge on Neandertals behavioral and oral care habits."}

Although India is a major opium exporter, the excessively prohibitive 1985 narcotics law formulated to control harmful use of drugs, impeded the availability and access to opioids for medical and scientific purposes. Amendment of this law in 2014 established a new national regulatory framework for improved access to essential opioid analgesics. This article reflects on key elements and processes that led to this landmark achievement. Unlike quick timelines associated with effecting policy reforms for law enforcement, realizing the 2014 drug policy change primarily to mitigate human suffering, was a 22-year-long process. The most exacting challenges included recognizing the multilayered complexities of the prior policy framework and understanding their adverse impact on field practices to chart an appropriate and viable path for reform. The evolution of an informal civil society movement involving health care professionals, lawyers, media, policy analysts, government officials, and the public was pivotal in addressing these challenges and garnering momentum for reform. The success of the effort for improving access to opioid medications was underpinned by a three-pronged strategy of 1) persuading the executive arm of the government to take interim enabling measures; 2) leveraging judicial intervention through public interest litigation; and 3) crafting a viable policy document for legislative approval and implementation. We hope our findings are useful for realizing drug policy reforms, given the current transformed global policy mandates emphasizing humanitarian, healthcare, and quality-of-life considerations."}

The study drug is an original gene construction in which pl-VEGF165 1.2 mg is the active substance. This postmarketing surveillance study was undertaken to evaluate the safety (identification of uncommon side effects) and efficacy of gene therapy in patients in routine clinical practice. In total, 210 patients with stage II-III chronic limb ischemia (according to the Fontaine classification modified by AV Pokrovsky) in 33 healthcare facilities in Russia and the Ukraine were enrolled in the study. The control group (n = 60) received conservative therapy without prostaglandins and prostacyclins, and the treatment group (n = 150) received treatment with pl-VEGF165 as two intramuscular injections for a total dose of 2.4 mg.

This article aims to review the psychological factors associated with NAFLD / NASH. Three main categories of factors have been investigated: emotional, cognitive and behavioral. Five electronic databases were searched, limited to studies published in the English language, during the period 2005-2015: PubMed, Thomson ISI - Web of Science, Scopus, ProQuest, and ScienceDirect. Results indicated the most relevant emotional factors to be depression and anxiety. The areas of investigation for cognitive functioning concern those contents and processes related to the ability to initiate and maintain lifestyle changes. The most important behavioral factors identified are physical activity, nutrition / food intake and substance consumption: coffee, alcohol, cigarettes. Some of the factors identified act as protective factors, other as vulnerability factors. NAFLD / NASH may be considered a cognitive-behavioral disease, the most effective management being lifestyle changes, with emphasis on diet and exercise."}

Solving this problem at the molecular functional level would allow mechanistic determinant identification- amino acids that distinguish details between functional families within a superfamily. Active site profiling was developed to identify mechanistic determinants. DASP and DASP2 were developed as tools to search sequence databases using active site profiling. Here, TuLIP (Two-Level Iterative clustering Process) is introduced as an iterative, divisive clustering process that utilizes active site profiling to separate structurally characterized superfamily members into functionally relevant clusters. Underlying TuLIP is the observation that functionally relevant families (curated by Structure-Function Linkage Database, SFLD) self-identify in DASP2 searches; clusters containing multiple functional families do not. Each TuLIP iteration produces candidate clusters, each evaluated to determine if it self-identifies using DASP2. If so, it is deemed a functionally relevant group. Divisive clustering continues until each structure is either a functionally relevant group member or a singlet. TuLIP is validated on enolase and glutathione transferase structures, superfamilies well-curated by SFLD. Correlation is strong; small numbers of structures prevent statistically significant analysis. TuLIP -identified enolase clusters are used in DASP2 GenBank searches to identify sequences sharing functional site features. Analysis shows a true positive rate of 96%, false negative rate of 4%, and maximum false positive rate of 4%. F-measure and performance analysis on the enolase search results and comparison to GEMMA and SCI-PHY demonstrate that TuLIP avoids the over-division problem of these methods. Mechanistic determinants for enolase families are evaluated and shown to correlate well with literature results."}

School engagement is measured as student attitudes to school (cognitive and emotional) and suspension rates (behavioural). Multivariable regression analyses examined student, family, and school factors affecting engagement. In comparison with state data, students with ADHD in the first year of high school were less motivated (p < .01) and less connected to peers (p < .01). Overall, there was no discordance in third year attitudes. There were high rates of suspension in both years in comparison to state-wide suspensions (21% vs. 6%, p < .01). Explanatory factors for poor attitudes include adolescent depression, poor adolescent supervision, and devaluing education. Conduct problems and increased hyperactivity were related to increased likelihood of being suspended, whilst higher cognitive ability, family socio-economic status, and independent schools reduced risk.

Although plasma at gas - liquid interface has a potential for a biomedical application, the interactions between the gas - liquid plasma and living cells remain unclear. Here, we show characteristics of a micropower plasma with 0.018 W of the power input, generated at gas - liquid interface. We also provide the evidence of plasma -induced enhancement in proliferation activity of endothelial cells. The plasma produced H2O2, HNO2, and HNO3 in phosphate buffered saline containing Mg(++) and Ca(++) (PBS (+)), and their concentration increased linearly during 600-second discharge. The value of pH in PBS (+) against the plasma discharge time was stable at about 7.0. Temperature in PBS (+) rose monotonically, and its rise was up to 0.8\u00b0C at the bottom of a cell-cultured dish by the plasma discharge for 600 s. Short-time treatment of the plasma enhanced proliferation activity of endothelial cells. In contrast, the treatment of H2O2 does not enhance the cell proliferation. Thus, the ROS production and the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) activation due to the plasma treatment might be related to enhancement of the cell proliferation.

One approach is to explore a pH -responsive strategy to target the slightly acidic solid tumor microenvironment. A novel class of pH (low) insertion peptides (pHLIPs) with pH -dependent transmembrane activity can fold and rapidly insert into the lipid bilayer of tumor cells triggered by acidity, facilitating the cellular internalization of nanomaterials synchronously. Here, we innovatively decorated gold nanostars (GNSs) with pHLIPs (GNS - pHLIP) to improve their targeting ability and photothermal therapeutic (PTT) efficiency. The obtained GNS - pHLIP exhibited the excellent characteristics of uniform size and good biocompatibility. As compared to GNS - mPEG, the cellular internalization of GNS - pHLIP was 1-fold higher after a 2 h incubation with cells in media at pH 6.4 than at pH 7.4. Moreover, the tumor accumulation of the GNS - pHLIP was 3-fold higher than that of GNS - mPEG after intravenous injection into MCF-7 breast tumor animal models for 24 h. Furthermore, GNS - pHLIP exhibited stronger signals than the GNS - mPEG through computed tomography (CT) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging. Simultaneously, the desirable targeting efficiency significantly improved the PTT efficacy to tumors, with low side effects on normal tissues.

A large body of work has shown that individuals tend to be weak risk averse in choice contexts involving risky and riskless gains but weak risk seeking in contexts involving losses, a phenomenon known as the reflection effect. Recent attempts to evaluate age differences in risk attitudes have relied on this weak definition, testing whether the reflection effect increases or diminishes as we grow older. The present work argues that weak risk attitudes have limited generalizability and proposes the use of a strong definition of risk that is concerned with preferences towards options with the same expected value but different degrees of risk (i.e., outcome variance). A reanalysis of previously-published data and the results from a new study show that only a minority of individuals manifests the reflection effect under a strong definition of risk, and that, when facing certain lottery - pair types, older adults appear to be more risk seeking than younger adults."}

The primary endpoint was cumulative response (\u226575% improvement from baseline within weeks 8-24) in at least one severe baseline symptom from the following: pruritus score of 9 or more, eight or more flushes per week, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression of 19 or more, or Fatigue Impact Scale of 75 or more. We assessed treatment effect using repeated measures methodology for rare diseases via the generalised estimating equation model in a modified intention-to-treat population, including all participants assigned to treatment minus those who withdrew due to a non-treatment-related cause. We assessed safety in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00814073.

However, most current measures of the attributable risk of air pollutants have not considered temporal relationships between exposure and risk. More importantly, limited information is available regarding the attributable risk due to ambient air pollutants in basin regions like the Sichuan Basin, China. To quantify the association between PM10 and deaths in the Basin region, we used a measure proposed recently within the framework of the distributed lag non-linear model to estimate the attributable risk in Chengdu, China. Meanwhile, we examined the association between PM10 and years of life lost (YLL). Our analysis showed that population-attributable fractions for non-accidental, respiratory, and cardiovascular mortality were 0.569% (95% CI: -3.474%, 4.374%), 0.695% (95% CI: -5.260%, 6.457%), and 0.631% (95% CI: -6.973%, 7.390%), respectively. On average, a 1\u03bcg/m(3) increase in PM10 was associated with cumulative increases of 0.26893, 0.30437, and 0.21924 YLL for non-accidental, respiratory, and cardiovascular mortality, respectively, referring to 20\u03bcg/m(3). In addition, we found an inverse U-shaped pattern for the cumulative risk with 350\u03bcg/m(3) as the reverse point. With a 1\u03bcg/m(3) increase in PM10, YLL changed more significantly than mortality. Moreover, PM10 demonstrated remarkable effects on YLL among men and the elderly."}

Promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF) is a transcription factor that can be activated by low-temperature far-infrared (FIR) irradiation to exert beneficial effects on the vascular endothelium. In the present study, we investigated the influence of FIR - induced PLZF activation on AGE - induced endothelial injury both in vitro and in vivo. FIR irradiation inhibited AGE - induced apoptosis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). PLZF activation increased the expression of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinases (PI3K), which are important kinases in the autophagic signaling pathway. FIR - induced PLZF activation led to autophagy in HUVEC, which was mediated through the upregulation of PI3K. Immunofluorescence staining showed that AGEs were engulfed by HUVECs and localized to lysosomes. FIR - induced autophagy promoted AGEs degradation in HUVECs. In nicotinamide / streptozotocin - induced diabetic mice, FIR therapy reduced serum AGEs and AGEs deposition at the vascular endothelium. FIR therapy also reduced diabetes - induced inflammatory markers in the vascular endothelium and improved vascular endothelial function. These protective effects of FIR therapy were not found in PLZF - knockout mice. Our data suggest that FIR - induced PLZF activation in vascular endothelial cells protects the vascular endothelium in diabetic mice from AGE - induced injury."}

They are currently FDA approved for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and it would be highly desirable to visualize them by ultrasound as well. Previous reports using the conventional ultrasound B-scan (pulse-echo) imaging technique have shown very limited detectability of these particles. The aim of this study is to explore the feasibility of imaging IONPs using the through-transmission ultrasound methodology and demonstrate their detectability using ultrasonic computed tomography (UCT). Commercially available IONPs were acoustically analysed to quantify their effect on the speed of sound (SOS) and acoustic attenuation as a function of concentration. Next, through-transmission projection and UCT imaging were performed on a breast mimicking phantom and on an ex vivo tissue model, to which IONPs were injected. Finally, an MRI scan was performed to verify that the same particles examined in the ultrasound experiment can be imaged by magnetic resonance, using the same clinically relevant concentrations. The results have shown a consistent concentration dependent speed of sound increase (1.86 [Formula: see text] rise per 100 \u00b5g \u00b7 ml(-1) IONPs). Imaging based on this property has shown a substantial contrast-to-noise ratio improvement (up to 5 fold, p < 0.01). The SOS -related effect generated a well discernible image contrast and allowed the detection of the particles existence and location, in both raster-scan projection and UCT imaging. Conversely, no significant change in the acoustic attenuation coefficient was noted. Based on these findings, it is concluded that IONPs can be used as an effective SOS - based contrast agent, potentially useful for ultrasonic breast imaging. Furthermore, the particle offers the capacity of significantly enhancing diagnosis accuracy using multimodal MRI - ultrasound imaging capabilities."}

Specific spatio-temporal patterns of cytosolic calcium elevations are critical determinants of cell fate in response to pro-apoptotic cellular stressors. As the apoptotic program can take hours or days, measurement of long-term calcium dynamics are essential for understanding the mechanistic role of calcium in apoptotic cell death. Due to the technical limitations of using calcium - sensitive dyes to measure cytosolic calcium little is known about long-term calcium dynamics in living cells after treatment with apoptosis - inducing drugs. Genetically encoded calcium indicators could potentially overcome some of the limitations of calcium - sensitive dyes. Here, we compared the performance of the genetically encoded calcium indicators GCaMP6s and GCaMP6f with the ratiometric dye Fura-2. GCaMP6s performed as well or better than Fura-2 in detecting agonist - induced calcium transients. We then examined the utility of GCaMP6s for continuously measuring apoptotic calcium release over the course of ten hours after treatment with staurosporine. We found that GCaMP6s was suitable for measuring apoptotic calcium release over long time courses and revealed significant heterogeneity in calcium release dynamics in individual cells challenged with staurosporine. Our results suggest GCaMP6s is an excellent indicator for monitoring long-term changes cytosolic calcium during apoptosis."}

Variables having a significant risk association with nocturia of greater than once per night were identified. Discriminating items from validated and reliable tools measuring these comorbidities were identified. A self-completed 57-item questionnaire was developed and a medical checklist and pertinent clinical measures added. Pre-determined criteria were applied to retain or remove items in the development of the Short-Form (SF) screening tool. The tool was administered to 252 individuals with nocturia who were attending either a tertiary level Sleep, Continence, Falls or Rehabilitation service for routine care. Data collected were subjected to descriptive analysis; criteria were applied to reduce the number of items. Using pre-determined domains, a nocturia screening metric, entitled TANGO, was generated. The acronym TANGO stands for Targeting the individual's Aetiology of Nocturia to Guide Outcomes. The demographic characteristics of the sample are described, along with item endorsement levels. The statistical and structural framework to justify deleting or retaining of items from the TANGO Long-Form to the SF is presented. The resultant TANGO - SF patient -completed nocturia screening tool is reported. A novel all-cause diagnostic metric for identifying co-existing morbidities of clinical relevance to nocturia in patients who present across disciplines and medical specialties has been developed.

In this study, we determined the cumulative acute exposure to OPs and CPs of Shanghai residents from vegetables and fruits (VFs). The food consumption data were obtained from the Shanghai Food Consumption Survey (SHFCS) of 2012-14 including a total of 1973 participants aged 2-90 years. The pesticide residue data were obtained from the Shanghai monitoring programme during 2008-11 with 34 organophosphates and 11 carbamates analysed in a total of 5335 samples of VFs. A probabilistic approach was performed as recommended by the EFSA, using the optimistic model with non-detects set as zero and with processing factors (PFs) being used and the pessimistic model with non-detects replaced by limit of detection (LOD) and without PFs. We used the relative potency factor (RPF) method to normalise the various pesticides to the index compound (IC) of methamidophos and chlorpyrifos separately. Only in the pessimistic model using methamidophos as the IC was there was small risk of exposure exceeding the ARfD (3 \u00b5g kg(-)(1) bw day (-)(1)) in the populations of preschool children (0.029%), school-age children (0.022%) and adults (0.002%). There were no risk of exposure exceeding the ARfD of methamidophos in the optimistic model and of chlorpyrifos (100 \u00b5g kg(-)(1) bw day (-)(1)) in both optimistic and pessimistic models in all three populations. Considering the Chinese habits of overwhelmingly eating processed food (vegetables being cooked, and fruits being washed or peeled), we conclude that little acute risk was found for the exposure to VF - sourced OPs and CPs in Shanghai."}

Protocol paper The MODEM project (A comprehensive approach to MODelling outcome and costs impacts of interventions for DEMentia) explores how changes in arrangements for the future treatment and care of people living with dementia, and support for family and other unpaid carers, could result in better outcomes and more efficient use of resources. MODEM starts with a systematic mapping of the literature on effective and (potentially) cost - effective interventions in dementia care. Those findings, as well as data from a cohort, will then be used to model the quality of life and cost impacts of making these evidence -based interventions more widely available in England over the period from now to 2040. Modelling will use a suite of models, combining microsimulation and macrosimulation methods, modelling the costs and outcomes of care, both for an individual over the life-course from the point of dementia diagnosis, and for individuals and England as a whole in a particular year. Project outputs will include an online Dementia Evidence Toolkit, making evidence summaries and a literature database available free to anyone, papers in academic journals and other written outputs, and a MODEM Legacy Model, which will enable local commissioners of services to apply the model to their own populations. Modelling the effects of evidence -based cost - effective interventions and making this information widely available has the potential to improve the health and quality of life both of people with dementia and their carers, while ensuring that resources are used efficiently."}

MeHg accumulation in the brain causes histopathological alterations, neurobehavioral changes, and impairments to cognitive motor functions in mammalian models. However, in birds the neurotoxic effects of MeHg on the developing pre - hatching brain and consequent behavioral alterations in adult birds have not received much attention. Moreover, passerine birds are poorly represented in MeHg neurotoxicology studies in comparison to other avian orders. Hence in this study, we used the egg injection method to investigate the long term effects of in ovo MeHg exposure on brain histopathology and courtship behavior in a model songbird species, the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata). Egg treatment groups included: a low MeHg dose of 0.2\u03bcg Hg g(-1) egg, a high MeHg dose of 3.2\u03bcg Hg g(-1) egg, and a vehicle control (water). No adverse effects of in ovo MeHg treatment were detected on courtship song quality or on mating behavior in experimental males at sexually maturity which would suggest that observable neurobehavioral effects of MeHg exposure may depend on the timing of exposure during offspring development. However, neuroanatomical analysis indicated an increase in telencephalon volume with increased MeHg concentrations which may suggest a prolonged inflammatory response in this region of the brain."}

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the Condom Barriers Scales for application with YBMSM. A clinic-based sample of 600 YBMSM completed a computer-assisted self-interview. The primary measure was a 14-item abbreviated version of the Condom Barriers Scale. Reliability and criterion validity were assessed. All 3 subscales were reliable: partner -related barriers (Cronbach \u03b1 =0.73), sensation -related barriers (\u03b1=0.70), and motivation -related barriers (\u03b1 =0.81). A complete absence of barriers was common: 47.0% (partner -related), 30.7% (sensation -related), and 46.5% (motivation -related). Dichotomized subscales were significantly associated with reporting any condomless insertive anal sex (all Ps < 0.001) and any condomless receptive anal sex (all Ps < 0.001). The subscales were significantly associated with these measures of condomless sex preserved at a continuous level (all Ps <0.001, except for sensation barriers associated with condomless receptive anal sex = 0.03). Further, the subscales were significantly associated with reporting any condom use problems (all Ps <0.001) and a measure of condomless oral sex (all Ps <0.001, except for partner -related barriers =0.31). Finally, the sensation -related barriers subscale was significantly associated with testing positive for Chlamydia and/or gonorrhea (P=0.049). The 3 identified subscales yielded adequate reliability and strong evidence of validity, thereby suggesting the utility of these brief measures for use in observational and experimental research with YBMSM."}

Despite previous efforts, many questions regarding the causes of base composition changes at these sites in Drosophila remain unanswered. To shed further light on this issue, we obtained a new whole-genome polymorphism data set from D. simulans. We analyzed samples from the putatively ancestral range of D. simulans, as well as an existing polymorphism data set from an African population of D. melanogaster. By using D. yakuba as an outgroup, we found clear evidence for selection on 4-fold sites along both lineages over a substantial period, with the intensity of selection increasing with GC content. Based on an explicit model of base composition evolution, we suggest that the observed AT- biased substitution pattern in both lineages is probably due to an ancestral reduction in selection intensity, and is unlikely to be the result of an increase in mutational bias towards AT alone. By using two polymorphism-based methods for estimating selection coefficients over different timescales, we show that the selection intensity on codon usage has been rather stable in D. simulans in the recent past, but the long-term estimates in D. melanogaster are much higher than the short-term ones, indicating a continuing decline in selection intensity, to such an extent that the short-term estimates suggest that selection is only active in the most GC -rich parts of the genome. Finally, we provide evidence for complex evolutionary patterns in the putatively neutral short introns, which cannot be explained by the standard GC - biased gene conversion model. These results reveal a dynamic picture of base composition evolution."}

Rats in the SAFI group were given SAFI (23 or 46mg/kg) before I / R injury. The results showed that SAFI treatment significantly decreased neuroinflammation and the infarction volume compared with the vehicle group. Activation of microglia cells was reduced, and TLR4 / NF-\u03baB signals, which were markedly inhibited by SAFI treatment in ischemic hemisphere, were accompanied by reduced expression and release of cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6.

With ongoing unrest, this is expected to rise. This is the first study to quantify the burden of mental disorders in the EMR. We used data from the Global Burden of Disease study (GBD) 2013. DALYs (disability-adjusted life years) allow assessment of both premature mortality (years of life lost - YLLs) and nonfatal outcomes (years lived with disability - YLDs). DALYs are computed by adding YLLs and YLDs for each age-sex-country group. In 2013, mental disorders contributed to 5.6% of the total disease burden in the EMR (1894 DALYS /100,000 population): 2519 DALYS /100,000 (2590/100,000 males, 2426/100,000 females) in high-income countries, 1884 DALYS /100,000 (1618/100,000 males, 2157/100,000 females) in middle-income countries, 1607 DALYS /100,000 (1500/100,000 males, 1717/100,000 females) in low-income countries. Females had a greater proportion of burden due to mental disorders than did males of equivalent ages, except for those under 15 years of age. The highest proportion of DALYs occurred in the 25-49 age group, with a peak in the 35-39 years age group (5344 DALYs /100,000). The burden of mental disorders in EMR increased from 1726 DALYs /100,000 in 1990 to 1912 DALYs /100,000 in 2013 (10.8% increase). Within the mental disorders group in EMR, depressive disorders accounted for most DALYs, followed by anxiety disorders. Among EMR countries, Palestine had the largest burden of mental disorders. Nearly all EMR countries had a higher mental disorder burden compared to the global level. Our findings call for EMR ministries of health to increase provision of mental health services and to address the stigma of mental illness. Moreover, our results showing the accelerating burden of mental health are alarming as the region is seeing an increased level of instability. "}

The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence and the characteristics of hyperandrogenemia in women with PCOS and to investigate the association of clinical and biochemical characteristics with body mass index (BMI) according to the presence of hyperandrogenemia. We studied 266 women diagnosed with PCOS. Hyperandrogenemia was defined by testosterone (T) and/or free testosterone (FT) and/or \u22064 androstenedione (\u03944-A) higher than 75% of the upper limits of each hormone. Patients were stratified in two groups according to a BMI threshold of 25 kg/m2. Hyperandrogenemia was present in 78.2% of the patients. Elevated levels of T were found in 58.4%, while elevated levels of FT and \u03944-A were found in 42.5% and 34.1% of patients. In normal weight women (BMI \u226425 kg/m2) with hyperandrogenemia lower values of hip circumference and HOMA-IR and increased levels of T, FT, \u03944-A, 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), white blood cells (WBC) and neutrophils were observed compared to women without hyperandrogenemia. Also, in overweight women higher levels of T, FT, \u03944-A, 17-OHP, DHEAS and cortisol were measured, while lower thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were comparable to women without hyperandrogenemia.

ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is considered as one of the prominent clinical forms of ACS. Moreover, C-reactive protein (CRP) is an important acute phase prsotein, which may be estimated using high-sensitivity methods (hs-CRP), and its elevated level in body fluids reflects chronic inflammatory status. The circulating hs-CRP level has been proposed as a promising inflammatory marker of coronary artery disease (CAD). The present study investigated the correlation of hs-CRP level with clinical and angiographic features of STEMI, various other traditional risk factors, complications of myocardial infarction and angiographically significant CAD. Out of 190 patients with STEMI that were analyzed, the interval between symptom onset and reperfusion therapy (window period) varied from 0.5 to 24 h. The hs-CRP value was found to be higher in non-diabetic patients (0.61 mg/dl) compared with diabetic patients (0.87 mg/dl). Moreover, a significant correlation between hs-CRP and hs-troponin T was also recorded (P<0.001). However, there was no significant difference in the mean hs-CRP values in patients with or without mortality. It is considered that the present study will increase the understanding of atherosclerosis in general and may also have clinical applications in the targeting of therapy for this harmful disease."}

In this analysis, we sought to assess the impact of a modified femoral artery puncture technique using digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and road mapping during transfemoral TAVI on periprocedural vascular and bleeding events. This is a retrospective analysis of transfemoral TAVI patients included in a prospective institutional database. The modified femoral artery puncture technique using DSA -derived road mapping guidance was introduced in October 2012. Before the introduction of this technique, vascular puncture was acquired based on an integration of angiographic data, the bony iliofemoral landmarks and a radiopaque object. Consecutive patients who underwent TAVI with the road mapping technique (RM group, n=160) were compared with consecutive patients who underwent TAVI without road mapping (control group, n=160) prior to its introduction. A standardised strategy of periprocedural anticoagulation was adopted in both groups as well as the use of a single suture-based closure device. All endpoints were defined according to the VARC-2 criteria for event definition. The mean age in the RM group was 80\u00b17.7 years compared to 81\u00b15.9 years in the control group (p=0.19), and females were equally distributed between both groups (63.1% vs. 58.1%, p=0.36).

AXIN1 and AXIN2 / Conductin, the rate-limiting factors for the stability and function of endogenous destruction complexes, are stabilized upon TNKS inhibition due to abrogated degradation of AXIN by the proteasome. Since the role of AXIN1 versus AXIN2 as scaffolding proteins in the Wnt signaling pathway still remains incompletely understood, we sought to elucidate their relative contribution in the formation of degradasomes, as these protein assemblies most likely represent the morphological and functional correlates of endogenous \u03b2-catenin destruction complexes. In SW480 colorectal cancer cells treated with the tankyrase inhibitor (TNKSi) G007-LK we found that AXIN1 was not required for degradasome formation. In contrast, the formation of degradasomes as well as their capacity to degrade \u03b2-catenin were considerably impaired in G007-LK-treated cells depleted of AXIN2. These findings give novel insights into differential functional roles of AXIN1 versus AXIN2 in the \u03b2-catenin destruction complex."}

However, the anatomy observed in magnitude and phase images does not always coincide spatially with that in susceptibility maps, which could give erroneous estimation in the reconstructed susceptibility map. In this paper, we develop a structural feature based collaborative reconstruction (SFCR) method for QSM including both magnitude and susceptibility based information. The SFCR algorithm is composed of two consecutive steps corresponding to complementary reconstruction models, each with a structural feature based l1 norm constraint and a voxel fidelity based l2 norm constraint, which allows both the structure edges and tiny features to be recovered, whereas the noise and artifacts could be reduced. In the M-step, the initial susceptibility map is reconstructed by employing a k-space based compressed sensing model incorporating magnitude prior. In the S-step, the susceptibility map is fitted in spatial domain using weighted constraints derived from the initial susceptibility map from the M-step. Simulations and in vivo human experiments at 7T MRI show that the SFCR method provides high quality susceptibility maps with improved RMSE and MSSIM. Finally, the susceptibility values of deep gray matter are analyzed in multiple head positions, with the supine position most approximate to the gold standard COSMOS result."}

Of these patients, 26% had been referred to adult diabetes care by 2014. Children with HbA1c < 72 mmol/mol (8.7%) (20% of patients, low group) at diagnosis continued to have good metabolic control during childhood, in contrast to children with HbA1c > 114 mmol/mol (12.6%) (20% of patients, high group) at diagnosis, who continued to have high HbA1c at follow-up. For the individual, there was no significant correlation between high HbA1c at onset and during follow-up. During follow-up, children in the high group were more often smokers, less physically active, and more often had retinopathy than children in the low group (P < .01, .01, .03 respectively).

Herein, we uncover that a photosensitizer, chlorin e6 (Ce6), could be decorated into the membrane of RBCs upon simple mixing, without affecting the membrane integrity and stability in dark. Upon light irradiation with a rather low power density, the generated singlet oxygen by Ce6 as the result of photodynamic effect would lead to rather efficient disruption of RBC membrane. With doxorubicin (DOX), a typical chemotherapy drug, as the model, we engineer a unique type of light-responsive RBC-based DDS by decorating Ce6 on the cell membrane and loading DOX inside cells. The light triggered cell membrane break down would thus trigger instant release of DOX, enabling light-controlled chemotherapy with great specificity. Beyond that, our RBC system could also be utilized for loading of larger biomolecules such as enzymes, whose release as well as catalytic function is also controlled by light. Our work thus presents a unique type of biocompatible cell-based DDS that can be precisely controlled by mild external stimuli, promising not only for cancer therapy but also for other potential applications in biotechnologies."}

LIF binds to the LIF receptor (LIFR) and activates the JAK-STAT3 pathway, but it remains unknown how the receptor complex triggers differentiation or self-renewal. Here, we report that the LIFR cytoplasmic domain contains a self-renewal domain within the juxtamembrane region and a differentiation domain within the C-terminal region. The differentiation domain contains four SPXX repeats that are phosphorylated by MAPK to restrict STAT3 activation; the self-renewal domain is characterized by a 3K motif that is acetylated by p300. In mESCs, acetyl- LIFR undergoes homodimerization, leading to STAT3 hypo- or hyper-activation depending on the presence or absence of gp130. LIFR - activated STAT3 restricts differentiation via cytokine induction. Thus, LIFR acetylation and serine phosphorylation differentially promote stem cell self-renewal and differentiation."}

Indeed, platelets within atheroma plaques have been shown to play a role in inflammation, in platelet - leucocyte aggregates and in thrombi formation and might thus be considered relevant biomarkers of atherosclerotic progression. The DNA sequence that encodes the anti-\u03b1IIb\u03b23 TEG4 scFv previously obtained from a phage-display selection on activated platelets, was inserted into the eukaryote vector (pPICZ\u03b1A) in fusion with a tag sequence encoding 2 cysteines useable for specific probes grafting experiments.

The advantage of P. pastoris as an expression system is the production and secretion of recombinant proteins in the supernatant, ruling out the difficulties encountered when scFv are produced in the cytoplasm of bacteria (low yield, low solubility and reduced affinity).

The identification of bona fide targets is challenging for researchers working on the functional aspect of miRNAs. Recently, we developed a method (miR-CATCH) based on biotinylated DNA antisense oligonucleotides that capture the mRNA of interest and facilitates the characterisation of miRNAs::mRNA interactions in a physiological cellular context. Here, the miR-CATCH technique was applied to the mesothelin (MSLN) gene and coupled with next generation sequencing (NGS), to identify miRNAs that regulate MSLN mRNA and that may be responsible for its increased protein levels found in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). Biotinylated MSLN oligos were employed to isolate miRNA::MSLN mRNA complexes from a normal cell line (Met-5A) which expresses low levels of MSLN. MiRNAs targeting the MSLN mRNA were identified by NGS and miR-21-5p and miR-100-5p were selected for further validation analyses. MiR-21-5p was shown to be able to modulate MSLN expression in miRNA mimic experiments in a panel of malignant and non-malignant cell lines. Further miRNA inhibitor experiments and luciferase assays in Mero-14 cells validated miR-21-5p as a true regulator of MSLN. Moreover, in vitro experiments showed that treatment with miR-21-5p mimic reduced proliferation of MPM cell lines. Altogether, this work shows that the miR-CATCH technique, coupled with NGS and in vitro validation, represents a reliable method to identify native miRNA::mRNA interactions. MiR-21-5p is suggested as novel regulator of MSLN with a possible functional role in cellular growth."}

A significant pH decrease was observed in the acidic soil for all ES-Zn fertilizer treatments and in the alkaline soil for the Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans - inoculated treatment only. In agreement with Zn visualization tests, extractable- Zn concentrations were higher from the point of application in the acidic (62.9 mg dm(-3)) compared to the alkaline soil (5.5 mg dm(-3)). Elemental S oxidation was greater in the acidic soil (20.9%) than slightly alkaline soil (12%). The ES-Zn granular fertilizers increased S and Zn concentrations in soil and can provide a strategically slow release of nutrients to the soil."}

However, accumulating evidence supports that transfusions correlate with worse survival outcomes in patients affected by solid cancers. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effects of perioperative blood transfusion in locally advanced cervical cancer. Data of consecutive patients affected by locally advanced cervical cancer scheduled to undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus radical surgery were retrospectively searched to test the impact of perioperative transfusions on survival outcomes. Five- year survival outcomes were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier and Cox models. The study included 275 patients. Overall, 170 (62%) patients had blood transfusion. Via univariate analysis, we observed that transfusion correlated with an increased risk of developing recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-4.40; P = 0.02). Other factors associated with 5- year disease-free survival were noncomplete clinical response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (HR, 2.99; 95% CI, 0.92-9.63; P = 0.06) and pathological (P = 0.03) response at neoadjuvant chemotherapy as well as parametrial (P = 0.004), vaginal (P < 0.001), and lymph node (P = 0.002) involvements. However, via multivariate analysis, only vaginal (HR, 3.07; 95% CI, 1.20-7.85; P = 0.01) and lymph node involvements (HR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.00-6.06; P = 0.05) correlate with worse disease-free survival.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) persists in most humans, requires T cell immunity to control, yet tissue immune responses remain undefined. Here, we investigated human CMV -specific T cells, virus persistence and CMV -associated T cell homeostasis in blood, lymphoid, mucosa l and secretory tissues of 44 CMV seropositive and 28 seronegative donors. CMV -specific T cells were maintained in distinct distribution patterns, highest in blood, bone marrow (BM), or lymph nodes (LN), with the frequency and function in blood distinct from tissues. CMV genomes were detected predominantly in lung and also in spleen, BM, blood and LN. High frequencies of activated CMV -specific T cells were found in blood and BM samples with low virus detection, whereas in lung, CMV -specific T cells were present along with detectable virus. In LNs, CMV -specific T cells exhibited quiescent phenotypes independent of virus. Overall, T cell differentiation was enhanced in sites of viral persistence with age. Together, our results suggest tissue T cell reservoirs for CMV control shaped by both viral and tissue - intrinsic factors, with global effects on homeostasis of tissue T cells over the lifespan."}

Lipids were assessed in patients with a first venous thrombosis (n = 2106) followed for 6.9 years. Lipids were not associated with recurrence, overall or in patients with unprovoked first events. Testing lipid levels is not useful to identify patients at an increased risk of recurrence. Background Knowledge of risk factors for recurrent venous thrombosis may guide decisions on duration of anticoagulation. The association between lipid levels and first venous thrombosis has been studied extensively. However, data on the role of lipids in the risk of recurrence are scarce. Objective To assess the association between lipid levels and recurrent venous thrombosis. Patients /Methods Patients with a first venous thrombosis from the MEGA study were included. Follow-up started at the date of end of anticoagulant treatment. Percentile categories of total / low-density lipoprotein / high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides and apolipoproteins B and A1 were established (< 10th, 10th-25th, 25th-75th [reference], 75th-90th, > 90th percentile). Lipids were measured at least 3 months after discontinuing anticoagulation. Results Of 2106 patients followed for a median of 6.9 years, 326 developed recurrence (incidence rate, 2.7/100 patient - years; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.5-3.1). With hazard ratios ranging from 0.88 (95% CI, 0.55-1.42) to 1.33 (95% CI, 0.86-2.04) in the highest percentile category vs. the reference, we found no association across percentile categories between recurrence and lipid levels in age- and sex -adjusted models, nor after further adjustments for body mass index, diabetes, estrogen and statin use, and duration of anticoagulation.

Bluetongue virus (BTV) is transmitted by Culicoides biting midges and causes bluetongue (BT), a clinical disease observed primarily in sheep. BT has a detrimental effect on subsistence farmers in India, where hyperendemic outbreaks impact on smallholdings in the southern states of the country. In this study, we establish a reliable method for testing the toxic effects of deltamethrin on Culicoides and then compare deltamethrin with traditional control methods used by farmers in India. Effects of deltamethrin were initially tested using a colonised strain of Culicoides nubeculosus Meigen and a modified World Health Organisation exposure assay. This method was then applied to field populations of Culicoides spp. in India. The field population of C. oxystoma in India had a greater LC50 (0.012 \u00b1 0.009%) for deltamethrin than laboratory-reared C.nubeculosus (0.0013 \u00b1 0.0002%). Exposure of C. nubeculosus to deltamethrin at higher ambient temperatures resulted in greater rates of knockdown but a lower mortality rate at 24 h post-exposure. Behavioural assays with C. nubeculosus in WHO tubes provided evidence for contact irritancy and spatial repellence caused by deltamethrin. The field experiments in India, however, provided no evidence for repellent or toxic effects of deltamethrin. Traditional methods such as the application of neem oil and burning of neem leaves also provided no protection. Our study demonstrates that field -collected Culicoides in India are less susceptible to deltamethrin exposure than laboratory-bred C. nubeculosus and traditional methods of insect control do not provide protection to sheep. These low levels of susceptibility to deltamethrin have not been recorded before in field populations of Culicoides and suggest resistance to synthetic pyrethrioids. Alternative insect control methods, in addition to vaccination, may be needed to protect Indian livestock from BTV transmission."}

Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) promote bone formation by auto-induction. Recombinant human BMP-7 in combination with bone grafts was used in 84 patients for the treatment of long bone nonunions. All patients were evaluated radiographicaly for the development of heterotopic ossification during the standard assessment for the nonunion healing. In all patients (80.9%) with radiographic signs of heterotopic ossification, a CT scan was performed. Nonunion site palpation and ROM evaluation of the adjacent joints were also carried out. Factors related to the patient (age, gender), the nonunion (location, size, chronicity, number of previous procedures, infection, surrounding tissues condition) and the surgical procedure (graft and fixation type, amount of rhBMP-7) were correlated with the development of heterotopic ossification and statistical analysis with Pearsons \u03c7 (2) test was performed. Eighty point nine percent of the nonunions treated with rhBMP-7, healed with no need for further procedures. Heterotopic bone formation occurred in 15 of 84 patients (17.8%) and it was apparent in the routine radiological evaluation of the nonunion site, in a mean time of 5.5 mo after the rhBMP-7 application (range 3-12). The heterotopic ossification was located at the femur in 8 cases, at the tibia in 6, and at the humerus in \u03bfne patient. In 4 patients a palpable mass was present and only in one patient, with a para-articular knee nonunion treated with rhBMP-7, the size of heterotopic ossification affected the knee range of motion.

Here we investigate the effects of H/O peptides upon tuberoinfundibular dopamine (TIDA) neurons - cells which control, via inhibition, the pituitary secretion of prolactin. In whole cell recordings performed in male rat hypothalamic slices, application of H/O-A, as well as H/O-B, excited oscillating TIDA neurons, inducing a reversible depolarising switch from phasic to tonic discharge. The H/O - induced inward current underpinning this effect was post-synaptic (as it endured in the presence of tetrodotoxin), appeared to be carried by a Na(+) - dependent transient receptor potential-like channel (as it was blocked by 2-APB and was diminished by removal of extracellular Na(+)), and was a consequence of OX2R receptor activation (as it was blocked by the OX2R receptor antagonist TCS OX2 29, but not the OX1R receptor antagonist SB 334867). Application of the hormone, melatonin, failed to alter TIDA membrane potential or oscillatory activity.

Contemporary mental health policies require organizations to work collaboratively with consumers in producing and delivering services. Using social exchange theory, which emphasises mutual exchange to maximise benefits in partnership, the current study explores the perspectives of those working within organizations that have some level of consumer leadership. Interviews were conducted with 14 participants from a range of mental health organizations. Data were transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analytic and discursive psychological techniques. Findings suggest stigma is still prevalent even in organizations that have consumers in leadership positions, and consumers are often perceived as less able to work in mental health organizations than non-consumers. Several discourses challenged such a view - showing how consumers bring value to mental health organizations through their expertise in the mental health system, and their ability to provide safety and support to other consumers. Through a social exchange theory lens, the authors call for organizations to challenge stigma and promote the value that consumers can bring to maximize mutual benefits."}

Explaining intraspecies variation in ocean acidification responses Ocean acidification (OA) poses a major threat to marine ecosystems globally, having significant ecological and economic importance. The number and complexity of experiments examining the effects of OA has substantially increased over the past decade, in an attempt to address multi-stressor interactions and long-term responses in an increasing range of aquatic organisms. However, differences in the response of males and females to elevated pCO2 have been investigated in fewer than 4% of studies to date, often being precluded by the difficulty of determining sex non-destructively, particularly in early life stages. Here we highlight that sex can significantly impact organism responses to OA, differentially affecting physiology, reproduction, biochemistry and ultimately survival. What is more, these impacts do not always conform to ecological theory based on differential resource allocation towards reproduction, which would predict females to be more sensitive to OA owing to the higher production cost of eggs compared with sperm. Therefore, non- sex - specific studies may overlook subtle but ecologically significant differences in the responses of males and females to OA, with consequences for forecasting the fate of natural populations in a near-future ocean."}

The infection known as dermatophytosis, caused by members of the genera Microsporum, Trichophyton, and Epidermophyton includes infection to the groin (tinea cruris), beard (tinea barbae), scalp (tinea capitis), feet (tinea pedis), glabrous skin (tinea corporis), nail (tinea unguium), and hand (tinea manuum). The identification of evolutionary relationship between these three genera of dermatophyte is epidemiologically important to understand their pathogenicity. Mitochondrial DNA evolves more rapidly than a nuclear DNA due to higher rate of mutation but is very less affected by genetic recombination, making it an important tool for phylogenetic studies. Thus, here we present a novel scheme to identify the conserved coil functional residues of Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Epidermophyton floccosum and Microsporum canis. Protein coding sequences of the mitochondrial genome were aligned for their similar sequences and homology modelling was performed for structure and pocket identification. The results obtained from comparative analysis of the protein sequences revealed the presence of functionally active sites in all the species of the genera Trichophyton and Microsporum. However in Epidermophyton floccosum it was observed in three protein sequences of the five studied. The absence of these conserved coil functional residues in E. floccusum may be correlated with lesser infectivity of this organism. The functional residues identified in the present study could be responsible for the disease and thus can act as putative target sites for drug designing."}

The corpora allata (CA) from female adult mosquitoes synthesize fluctuating levels of JH, which have been linked to the ovarian development and are influenced by nutritional signals. The rate of JH biosynthesis is controlled by the rate of flux of isoprenoids in the pathway, which is the outcome of a complex interplay of changes in precursor pools and enzyme levels. A comprehensive study of the changes in enzymatic activities and precursor pool sizes have been previously reported for the mosquito Aedes aegypti JH biosynthesis pathway. In the present studies, we used two different quantitative approaches to describe and predict how changes in the individual metabolic reactions in the pathway affect JH synthesis. First, we constructed generalized additive models (GAMs) that described the association between changes in specific metabolite concentrations with changes in enzymatic activities and substrate concentrations. Changes in substrate concentrations explained 50% or more of the model deviances in 7 of the 13 metabolic steps analyzed. Addition of information on enzymatic activities almost always improved the fitness of GAMs built solely based on substrate concentrations. GAMs were validated using experimental data that were not included when the model was built. In addition, a system of ordinary differential equations (ODE) was developed to describe the instantaneous changes in metabolites as a function of the levels of enzymatic catalytic activities. The results demonstrated the ability of the models to predict changes in the flux of metabolites in the JH pathway, and can be used in the future to design and validate experimental manipulations of JH synthesis."}

Interaction of gender and age category (\u226550 or not) was assessed. Hepatocellular injury was more prevalent in women <50 years vs. others (P=.002). After adjusting for biochemical injury types, black race and possible ageing effects, more severe interface hepatitis was noted in biopsies of women <50 years compared to those of men and women \u226550 years (P=.009 and P=.055 respectively). Compared to those of men, biopsies of women showed greater plasma cell infiltration, hepatocyte apoptosis, hepatocyte rosettes and lobular disarray but less iron - positive hepatocytes and histological cholestasis (P<.05). These associations persisted after excluding cases of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, anabolic steroids or nitrofurantoin DILI which showed gender -specific distributions.

However, the application of oridonin for cancer therapy was hampered primarily by its moderate potency. In this study, a series of oridonin A-ring modified analogues, and their derivatives bearing various substituents on 14-OH position, were designed, synthesized, and evaluated for anticancer efficacy. Some of the derivatives were significantly more potent than oridonin against both drug - sensitive and drug-resistant cancer cells. The most potent compound, 13p, was 200-fold more efficacious than oridonin in MCF-7 cancer cells. Furthermore, 13p induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase. A decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential and an increase in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, accompanied by activated caspase-3 cleavage, were observed in MCF-7 cells after treatment with 13p, suggesting that the mitochondrial pathway was involved in the 13p -mediated apoptosis. Moreover, 13p significantly inhibited tumor growth in mouse xenograft models and had no observable toxic effect."}

Current screening and imaging tools are insufficient to detect early lesions and are not capable of differentiating the subtypes of ovarian cancer that may benefit from specific treatments. As an alternative to current screening and imaging tools, we utilized wavelength dependent collagen -specific Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) imaging microscopy and optical scattering measurements to probe the structural differences in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of normal stroma, benign tumors, endometrioid tumors, and low and high-grade serous tumors. The SHG signatures of the emission directionality and conversion efficiency as well as the optical scattering are related to the organization of collagen on the sub-micron size scale and encode structural information. The wavelength dependence of these readouts adds additional characterization of the size and distribution of collagen fibrils / fibers relative to the interrogating wavelengths. We found a strong wavelength dependence of these metrics that are related to significant structural differences in the collagen organization and are consistent with the dualistic classification of type I and II serous tumors. Moreover, type I endometrioid tumors have strongly differing ECM architecture than the serous malignancies. The SHG metrics and optical scattering measurements were used to form a linear discriminant model to classify the tissues, and we obtained high accuracy (>90%) between high-grade serous tumors from the other tissue types. High-grade serous tumors account for ~70% of ovarian cancers, and this delineation has potential clinical applications in terms of supplementing histological analysis, understanding the etiology, as well as development of an in vivo screening tool. SHG and optical scattering measurements provide sub-resolution information and when combined provide superior diagnostic power over clinical imaging modalities. Additionally the measurements are able to delineate the different subtypes of ovarian cancer and may potentially assist in treatment protocols. Understanding the altered collagen assembly can supplement histological analysis and provide new insight into the etiology. "}

The low wear offered by MoM bearings compared to metal-on-polyethylene and the possibility of a lower risk of dislocation with larger head sizes, encouraged a trend towards the re-introduction of the MoM bearing couple. However, recent evidence has shown that not all designs of the MoM bearing have been successful. The purpose of this paper is to provide an update on the use of MoM bearings and address the following issues: (1) the reintroduction of metal-on-metal bearings in total hip arthroplasty, (2) the failure of metal-on-metal bearings in stemmed total hip arthroplasty, (3) the role of metal-on-metal hip resurfacing in modern orthopaedics and (4) metal-on-metal hip resurfacing versus total hip arthroplasty. A literature search strategy was conducted using various search terms in MEDLINE and Embase. The highest quality articles that met the inclusion criteria and best answered the topics of focus of this review were selected. Key search terms included ' metal-on-metal ', ' total hip arthroplasty ' and ' hip resurfacing '. The initial search retrieved 1240 articles. Twenty-two articles were selected and used in the review. Metal-on-metal hip resurfacing is still a suitable treatment option in specific patient populations with the appropriate implant design and surgical skill, while stemmed metal-on-metal total hip arthroplasty should be avoided in all patient populations. Continued follow-up of patients undergoing metal-on-metal hip resurfacing is critical in order to further understand the long-term outcomes of these patients and why certain complications tend to occur with this procedure."}

Thus, we aim to determine the potential of the recently introduced third-generation dual-source CT (DSCT) for CTA in a 'real-life' clinical setting. Two hundred and sixty-eight consecutive patients (age: 67 \u00b1 10 years; BMI: 27 \u00b1 5 kg/m\u00b2; 61% male) undergoing clinically indicated CTA with DSCT were included in the retrospective single-center analysis.

A subset underwent invasive angiography to determine the diagnostic accuracy of CTA. SSM (96.8 \u00b1 6%) and HSM (97.5 \u00b1 8%) provided no significant differences in the overall diagnostic image quality. However, AS had significant influence on diagnostic image quality exclusively in SSM (B = 0.003; p = 0.0001), but not in HSM. Diagnostic image quality significantly decreased in SSM in patients with AS \u22652,000 (p = 0.03).

Both phenomena require self-maintaining and self-organizing patterning mechanisms, the molecular mechanisms of which remain poorly understood. We show that a morphogenic gradient of canonical Wnt signaling patterns gene expression along the planarian anteroposterior (A/P) axis. Our results demonstrate that gradient formation likely occurs autonomously in the tail and that an autoregulatory module of Wnt -mediated Wnt expression both shapes the gradient at steady state and governs its re-establishment during regeneration. Functional antagonism between the tail Wnt gradient and an unknown head patterning system further determines the spatial proportions of the planarian A/P axis and mediates mutually exclusive molecular fate choices during regeneration. Overall, our results suggest that the planarian A/P axis is patterned by self-organizing patterning systems deployed from either end that are functionally coupled by mutual antagonism."}

Endosperm, Changes the Seeds Oil Content in Transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana and Rice (Oryza sativa L .) Coconut (Cocos nucifera L.) is a key tropical crop and a member of the monocotyledonous family Arecaceae (Palmaceae). Few genes and related metabolic processes involved in coconut endosperm development have been investigated. In this study, a new member of the WRI1 gene family was isolated from coconut endosperm and was named CoWRI1. Its transcriptional activities and interactions with the acetyl-CoA carboxylase (BCCP2) promoter of CoWRI1 were confirmed by the yeast two-hybrid and yeast one-hybrid approaches, respectively. Functional characterization was carried out through seed -specific expression in Arabidopsis and endosperm -specific expression in rice. In transgenic Arabidopsis, high over-expressions of CoWRI1 in seven independent T2 lines were detected by quantitative real-time PCR. The relative mRNA accumulation of genes encoding enzymes involved in either fatty acid biosynthesis or triacylglycerols assembly (BCCP2, KASI, MAT, ENR, FATA, and GPDH) were also assayed in mature seeds. Furthermore, lipid and fatty acids C16:0 and C18:0 significantly increased. In two homozygous T2 transgenic rice lines (G5 and G2), different CoWRI1 expression levels were detected, but no CoWRI1 transcripts were detected in the wild type. Analyses of the seed oil content, starch content, and total protein content indicated that the two T2 transgenic lines showed a significant increase (P < 0.05) in seed oil content. The transgenic lines also showed a significant increase in starch content, whereas total protein content decreased significantly. Further analysis of the fatty acid composition revealed that palmitic acid (C16:0) and linolenic acid (C18:3) increased significantly in the seeds of the transgenic rice lines, but oleic acid (C18:1) levels significantly declined."}

The objective of this study was to reduce/minimize these undesirable deformations by the application of Functionally Graded Materials (FGM). To do this, Finite Element (FE) method was employed to simulate the expansion of a stent and the corresponding displacement of the stenosis plaque. Three hyperelastic plaque types as well as five elastoplastic stents were simulated. Dogboning, foreshortening, maximum stress in the plaque, and the pressure which is needed to fully expand the stent for different stent materials, were acquired. While all FGMs had lower dogboning in comparison to the stents made of the uniform materials, the stent with the lowest heterogeneous index displayed the lowest amount of dogboning. Steel stent showed the lowest foreshortening and fully expansion pressure but the difference was much lower than that the one for dogboning. Therefore, the FGM with the heterogeneous index of 0.5 is expected to exhibit the most suitable results. In addition, the results revealed that the material parameters has crucial effects on the deformation of the stent and, as a result, as a design point of view the FGM parameters can be tailored to achieve the goal of the biomechanical optimization."}

In anticipation of this development, we sought to inform future policy and practice by identifying potential barriers to HPV self-sampling. A cross-sectional survey of 194 women aged 20-64 years was conducted. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify determinants of self-sampling intentions. A purposive subsample of 19 women who reported low self-sampling intentions were interviewed. Interviews were framework-analysed. Most survey participants (N=133, 69.3%) intended to HPV self-sample. Lower intention was associated with lower self-efficacy (OR=24.96, P\u2264.001), lower education (OR=6.06, P\u2264.05) and lower perceived importance of HPV as a cause of cervical cancer (OR=2.33, P\u2264.05). Interviews revealed personal and system-related barriers. Personal barriers included a lack of knowledge about HPV self-sampling, women's low confidence in their ability to self-sample correctly and low confidence in the subsequent results. System-related factors included a lack of confidence in the rationale for modifying the current cervical screening programme, and concerns about sample contamination and identity theft. Insights gained from this research can be used to guide further enquiry into the possibility of HPV self-sampling and to help inform future policy and practice.

This deficiency results in the accumulation of homogentisic acid (HGA) in the form of ochronotic pigment in joint cartilage, leading to a severe arthropathy. Secondary amyloidosis has been also unequivocally assessed as a comorbidity of AKU arthropathy. Composition of ochronotic pigment and how it is structurally related to amyloid is still unknown. We exploited Synchrotron Radiation Infrared and X-Ray Fluorescence microscopies in combination with conventional bio-assays and analytical tools to characterize chemical composition and morphology of AKU cartilage. We evinced that AKU cartilage is characterized by proteoglycans depletion, increased Sodium levels, accumulation of lipids in the peri-lacunar regions and amyloid formation. We also highlighted an increase of aromatic compounds and oxygen-containing species, depletion in overall Magnesium content (although localized in the peri-lacunar region) and the presence of calcium carbonate fragments in proximity of cartilage lacunae. We highlighted common features between AKU and arthropathy, but also specific signatures of the disease, like presence of amyloids and peculiar calcifications. Our analyses provide a unified picture of AKU cartilage, shedding a new light on the disease and opening new perspectives. Ochronotic pigment is a hallmark of AKU and responsible of tissue degeneration. Conventional bio-assays have not yet clarified its composition and its structural relationship with amyloids. The present work proposes new strategies for filling the aforementioned gap that encompass the integration of new analytical approaches with standardized analyses."}

The antibacterial properties of the piperidinol compound and its corresponding bis-Mannich base analogue were evaluated against M. smegmatis and Gram-negative organisms. Cytotoxicity studies were undertaken in order to determine the selectivity index for these compounds. Spontaneous resistant mutants of M. smegmatis were generated against the piperidinol and corresponding bis-Mannich base lead derivatives and whole genome sequencing employed to determine the genetic modifications that lead to selection pressure in the presence of these compounds. The piperidinol and the bis-Mannich base analogue were found to be selective for mycobacteria and rapidly kill this organism with a cytotoxicity selectivity index for mycobacteria of >30-fold.

Although this process is well studied in vitro, knowledge gaps remain regarding the relative contribution of the microbiota members and enzymes in vivo. The present study used RNA-sequencing to reveal both the expression of genes encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) by the rumen microbiota of a lactating dairy cow and the microorganisms forming the fiber -degrading community. Functional analysis identified 12,237 CAZymes, accounting for 1% of the transcripts. The CAZyme profile was dominated by families GH94 (cellobiose-phosphorylase), GH13 (amylase), GH43 and GH10 (hemicellulases), GH9 and GH48 (cellulases), PL11 (pectinase) as well as GH2 and GH3 (oligosaccharidases). Our data support the pivotal role of the most characterized fibrolytic bacteria (Prevotella, Ruminocccus and Fibrobacter), and highlight a substantial, although most probably underestimated, contribution of fungi and ciliate protozoa to polysaccharide degradation. Particularly these results may motivate further exploration of the role and the functions of protozoa in the rumen. Moreover, an important part of the fibrolytic bacterial community remains to be characterized since one third of the CAZyme transcripts originated from distantly related strains. These findings are used to highlight limitations of current metatranscriptomics approaches to understand the functional rumen microbial community and opportunities to circumvent them."}

Exploiting the natural variation in CO2 assimilation rate (A) between rice cultivars using quantitative genetics is one promising means to identify genes contributing to higher photosynthesis. In this study, we determined precise location of Carbon Assimilation Rate 8 (CAR8) by crossing a high-yielding indica cultivar with a Japanese commercial cultivar. Fine mapping suggested that CAR8 encodes a putative Heme Activator Protein 3 (OsHAP3) subunit of a CCAAT-box-binding transcription factor called OsHAP3H. Sequencing analysis revealed that the indica allele of CAR8 has a 1-bp deletion at 322 bp from the start codon, resulting in a truncated protein of 125 amino acids. In addition, CAR8 is identical to DTH8 / Ghd8 / LHD1, which was reported to control rice flowering date. The increase of A is largely due to an increase of RuBP regeneration rate via increased leaf nitrogen content, and partially explained by reduced stomatal limitation via increased stomatal conductance relative to A. This allele also increases hydraulic conductivity, which would promote higher stomatal conductance. This indicates that CAR8 affects multiple physiological aspects relating to photosynthesis. The detailed analysis of molecular functions of CAR8 would help to understand the association between photosynthesis and flowering and demonstrate specific genetic mechanisms that can be exploited to improve photosynthesis in rice and potentially other crops."}

The present study was carried out to determine the prevalence of haemoglobinopathies and \u03b2-thalassaemia among the tribals working in the tea gardens of Assam. A total 1204 samples from the tribals working in tea gardens of Assam were analysed for both Complete Blood Count (CBC) and High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) for detection of haemoglobinopathies and \u03b2-thalassaemia. This study showed that the prevalence of sickle cell anaemia and \u03b2-thalassaemia were very high among this population. Our results indicated a higher prevalence of \u03b2-thalassaemia (3.07%) among the Munda ethnic group and higher prevalence of sickle cell anaemia (4.73%) among the Lohar ethnic group. This was the first study to report the presence of HbE among the tribals working in the tea gardens of Assam. Based on the present findings, sickle cell anaemia and \u03b2-thalassaemia were major health problem for the tribals working in the tea gardens of Assam.

Patients generally present with dysphagia as their first symptom and more often they have advanced disease at the time of presentation to a tertiary care centre. Palliative procedures have important roles in this setting. Stenting is the best option to palliate the symptoms of dysphagia, from which patient is suffering the most. To know the success rate, early and long term complications and mortality in esophageal stenting, when it was done in malignant esophageal stricture patients. One hundred patients, who had undergone esophageal stenting from January 2012 to January 2015, were included in the study. We retrospectively analysed the data for patient characteristics, causes of non-operability, early and long term complications, re-interventions, efficacy and mortality. Out of 100 patients, indications for stenting were locally advanced disease not amenable to surgery (52%), metastatic disease (35%), CVA (1%), cardiac and respiratory problem (8%), un-willing for surgery in 5% of patients. Majority of patients (94%) had squamous cell carcinoma, while only 6% had adenocarcinoma. 84% of patients presented with dysphagia with or without chest pain and recurrent cough while 16% had recurrent vomiting. 58% had dysphagia to liquids and solids and 17% had complete dysphagia. After stenting 93% had significant improvement in dysphagia score from median of 3 to 1. Post procedure stay was 3.61\u00b11.0 days. One patient had procedure related major complication in the form of post procedural bleed (after 16 days of stenting) leading to death of that patient. Minor complications were present in 52 patients treated conservatively not affecting the efficacy of procedure.

We evaluated the efficacy of topical imiquimod (IQ) followed by carbon dioxide laser ablation of the lesion. From 2010 to 2015, 10 patients affected by CIS of the glans were treated by IQ, followed by carbon dioxide laser ablation. For every patient, we performed histologic examination before and after IQ. Local toxicity and adverse effects were recorded. After treatment, histologic examination showed no residual tumor in 6 patients (complete response [CR]), stable disease in 2 patients, and progressive disease in 2 patients. Those with a CR had human papillomavirus - related lesions, and they had no experienced relapses after a mean follow-up of 26 months. The 2 patients with progressive disease underwent total penectomy. All patients were alive at the last follow-up examination. All patients experienced a mild local toxicity (burning erythema) but no major adverse effects. Local treatment with IQ for glans CIS is effective mainly for human papillomavirus - related lesions. The present study is the first to record the histologic examination findings before and after IQ treatment. The small number of patients, owing to the rarity of this disease, was the main limitation of the present study.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Experimental dogs were randomly divided into donor (group A), SCS (group B), and HMP (group C) (n=30) groups. Livers retrieved from group A were transplanted into group B after SCS, and the livers sampled from group B were transplanted into group C after HMP. The dogs in group A were euthanized and discarded, and the livers sampled from group C were used for other experiments. Twenty dogs with successful liver transplants were randomly selected from groups B and C for analysis. RESULTS During the liver sampling process, the levels of OSF, AM, and Snail between the 2 groups showed no significant differences (P>0.05); before the transplantation, the levels of chemokine CXCL14 and Snail between the 2 groups showed no significant differences (P>0.05), and compared with group B, HIF-1\u03b1 and P-selectin in group C were lower (P<0.01); 60 min after the transplantation, HIF-1\u03b1, chemokine CXCL14, P-selectin, and Snail in group C were lower than that in group B (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS HMP can significantly reduce the levels of OSF and inflammatory factors, which is conducive for liver transplantation."}

Respiratory failure, i.e. when the respiratory system fails in its gas exchange functions, is a common feature in muscular dystrophy, being the main cause of death, and it is a consequence of lung failure, pump failure or a combination of the two. The former is due to recurrent aspiration, the latter to progressive weakness of respiratory muscles and an increase in the load against which they must contract. In fact, both the resistive and elastic components of the work of breathing increase due to airway obstruction and chest wall and lung stiffening, respectively. The respiratory disturbances in muscular dystrophy are restrictive pulmonary function, hypoventilation, altered thoracoabdominal pattern, hypercapnia, dyspnoea, impaired regulation of breathing, inefficient cough and sleep disordered breathing. They can be present at different rates according to the type of muscular dystrophy and its progression, leading to different onset of each symptom, prognosis and degree of respiratory involvement. A common feature of muscular dystrophy is respiratory failure, i.e. the inability of the respiratory system to provide proper oxygenation and carbon dioxide elimination .In the lung, respiratory failure is caused by recurrent aspiration, and leads to hypoxaemia and hypercarbia. Ventilatory failure in muscular dystrophy is caused by increased respiratory load and respiratory muscles weakness. Respiratory load increases in muscular dystrophy because scoliosis makes chest wall compliance decrease, atelectasis and fibrosis make lung compliance decrease, and airway obstruction makes airway resistance increase .The consequences of respiratory pump failure are restrictive pulmonary function, hypoventilation, altered thoracoabdominal pattern, hypercapnia, dyspnoea, impaired regulation of breathing, inefficient cough and sleep disordered breathing.

We utilized The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program to identify cervical cancer patients who underwent hysterectomy between 1973 and 2003. Logistic regression models were used to identify risk factors for uterine corpus tumor invasion on multivariable analysis. Association of uterine corpus tumor invasion and cause-specific survival (CSS) from cervical cancer was examined with Cox proportional hazard regression models on multivariable analysis. We identified 837 (4.9%) cases of uterine corpus invasion and 16,237 (95.1%) cases of non-invasion. Median follow-up time was 14.0 years. There were 1642 deaths due to cervical cancer. Uterine corpus invasion was independently associated with older age, non-squamous histology, high-grade tumors, large tumor size, and nodal metastasis on multivariable analysis (all, P < 0.001). On univariable analysis, uterine corpus tumor invasion was significantly associated with decreased CSS compared to the non-invasion (5-year rates, 79.0% versus 94.5%, P < 0.001). After controlling for other significant prognostic factors, uterine corpus tumor invasion remained an independent prognostic factor for decreased CSS (adjusted-hazard ratio 1.45, 95% confidence interval 1.21-1.74). Among stage T1b cases (n = 6730), uterine corpus tumor invasion remained an independent prognostic factor for decreased CSS (adjusted-hazard ratio 1.95, 95%CI 1.47-2.60).

Oleaginous yeasts have recently been proposed as alternative lipid producers to plants and animals to promote sustainability in the chemical and fuel industries. The oleaginous yeast Lipomyces starkeyi has great industrial potential as an excellent lipid producer. However, improvement of its lipid productivity is essential for the cost-effective production of oleochemicals and fuels. Genetic and metabolic engineering of L. starkeyi via gene manipulation techniques may result in improvements in lipid production and our understanding of the mechanisms behind lipid biosynthesis pathways. We previously described an integrative transformation system using a drug -resistant marker for L. starkeyi. However, gene-targeting frequencies were very low because non-homologous recombination is probably predominant in L. starkeyi. Genetic engineering tools for L. starkeyi have not been sufficiently developed. In this study, we describe a new genetic tool and its application in L. starkeyi. To develop a highly efficient gene-targeting system for L. starkeyi, we constructed a series of mutants by disrupting genes for LsKu70p, LsKu80p, and/or LsLig4p, which share homology with other yeasts Ku70p, Ku80p, and Lig4p, respectively, being involved in non-homologous end-joining pathway. Deletion of the LsLIG4 gene dramatically improved the homologous recombination efficiency (80.0%) at the LsURA3 locus compared with that in the wild-type strain (1.4%), when 2000-bp homologous flanking regions were used. The homologous recombination efficiencies of the double mutant \u2206l sku70\u2206lslig4 and the triple mutant \u2206lsku70\u2206lsku80\u2206lslig4 were also markedly enhanced.

(Am. J. Bot. 103: 975-978) proposed that constraints imposed by the packing of young leaves in buds could explain the positive association between non-entire leaf margins and latitude but did not thoroughly consider alternative explanations. We review the logic and evidence underlying six major hypotheses for the functional significance of marginal teeth, involving putative effects on (1) leaf cooling, (2) optimal support and supply of the areas served by major veins, (3) enhanced leaf - margin photosynthesis, (4) hydathodal function, (5) defense against herbivores, and (6) bud packing. Theoretical and empirical problems undermine all hypotheses except the support-supply hypothesis, which implies that thinner leaves should have non-entire margins. Phylogenetically structured analyses across angiosperms, the El Yunque flora, and the genus Viburnum all demonstrate that non-entire margins are indeed more common in thinner leaves. Across angiosperms, the association of leaf thickness with non-entire leaf margins is stronger than that of latitude. We outline a synthetic model showing how biomechanics, hydraulics, vein geometry, rates of leaf expansion, and length of development within resting buds, all tied to leaf thickness, drive patterns in the distribution of entire vs. non-entire leaf margins. Our model accounts for dominance of entire margins in the tropics, Mediterranean scrub, and tundra, non-entire margins in cold temperate deciduous forests and tropical vines and early-successional trees, and entire leaf margins in monocots. Spinose-toothed leaves should be favored in short-statured evergreen trees and shrubs, primarily in Mediterranean scrub and related semiarid habitats."}

Patients receiving PN currently (n = 18) showed more advanced liver injury than patients after weaning off PN (n = 30). Histologic portal inflammation strongly segregated PN - dependent (44%) from weaned off patients (3%, P = 0.001) and coupled with progression of cholestasis and liver fibrosis. Patients with portal inflammation demonstrated markedly induced liver RNA expression of IL6 and TNF, repression of FXR and its canalicular bile transporter target gene RNA expression, including ABCB4 and ABCB11 as well as decreased protein expression of ABCB11 and ABCB4. Furthermore, upregulation of LXR and ABCG5/8 RNA expression was suppressed in patients with portal inflammation. Current PN, increased serum levels of plant sterols stigmasterol, avenasterol, and sitosterol along with serum citrulline, a marker of enterocyte mass, predicted portal inflammation. In pediatric onset IF, current PN delivery synergistically with intestinal compromise promote liver inflammation, which associates with progression of biochemical and histologic liver injury, while reducing expression of canalicular bile transporters."}

The Physical Frailty in Elderly Cancer patients (PF - EC) study (France) is a prospective bicentric observational cohort study. Two hundred and ninety outpatients with cancer were included. A cross-sectional analysis of oncologic factors and geriatric variables associated with disability that were collected using a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) was conducted. Disability was defined as impairment in activities of daily living (ADL) and/or instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), simplified to four items. Univariate and multivariate logistic models of disabled patients were performed. The three final multivariate models were compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC / ROC) of the logistic model. The mean age was 80.6years, and 51% of the patients were women with various types of cancer. The prevalence of disability was 67.6%. No oncologic factors (cancer site, cancer extension) were associated with disability. Impaired mobility, poor functional status, depressive mood, cognitive impairment and polypharmacy were independently associated with disability (P<0.05). The AUC/ROC of the final models was similar. Disability was highly prevalent in older cancer outpatients before cancer treatment but was not associated with oncologic factors. Impaired mobility, depressed mood, cognitive impairment and polypharmacy were the geriatric variables significantly and independently associated with disability. Identifying these factors prior to cancer treatment could enable the implementation of corrective actions to improve patient autonomy before treatment and during follow-up."}

In this study, we conducted chronic toxicity tests and investigated the metabolic changes of the growing Daphna similis with exposure to 0, 0.02, and 1 ppb AgNPs, using non-targeted mass spectrometry -based metabolomics. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to report the baseline metabolite change of a common aquatic organism Daphnia crustacean through its life-cycle. The results show a dynamic kinetic pattern of the growing Daphnia's metabolome underwent a cycle from day 0 to day 21, with the level of metabolites gradually increasing from day 0 to day 13, before falling back to the baseline level of day 0 on day 21. As for the samples exposed to environmental concentrations of AgNPs, although without morphological or structural changes, numerous metabolite changes occurred abruptly during the first 10 days, and these changes reached steady state by day 13. The significant changes in certain metabolites, such as amino acids (serine, threonine and tyrosine), sugars (d-allose) and fatty acids (arachidonic acid) revealed new insights into how these metabolites in Daphnia respond to chronic AgNPs stress.

We conducted two cross-sectional household surveys among married women aged 15-49 years in intervention and comparison districts. Difference-in-difference models were used to assess the efficacy of the intervention, adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics. Although both intervention types improved abortion knowledge, the HIM intervention was more effective in improving comprehensive knowledge about abortion. In particular, there were improvements in knowledge on legality of abortion (AOR=2.2; 95% CI 1.6 to 2.9) and nearby sources of safe abortion care (AOR=1.7; 95% CI 1.2 to 1.3). Higher level of exposure to abortion-related messages was related to more accurate knowledge about abortion within both intervention groups. Evidence was mixed on changes in abortion care-seeking behaviour. More work is needed to ensure that women seek safe abortion services in lieu of informal services that may be more likely to lead to postabortion complications."}

We identified newly occurring cardio - cerebrovascular disease over 7 years (from 2007 to 2013). After stratification by age, sex, and national health insurance type, we identified 7 years' cumulative incidence of cardio - cerebrovascular disease by health examination compliance and estimated its relative risk by health examination period and compliance. The compliant group presented a lower cumulative incidence of cardio - cerebrovascular disease than the non-compliant group; this result was consistent across sex, working age (40s and 50s), and workplace policyholder. Relative risk of cardio - cerebrovascular disease by health examination period (1 and 2 years) showed statistically significant results in ischemic heart disease for male participants. Of men in their 40s, office workers (over a 2-year period) presented statistically higher relative risk of ischemic heart disease than non-office workers (over a 1-year period: 1.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.03). However, there were no consistent results in ischemic cerebrovascular disease and hemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease for men or cardio - cerebrovascular disease for women. A 1-year period of Workers ' General Health Examinations in non-office workers had a more significant prevention effect on ischemic heart disease than a 2-year period in office workers among working age (40s-50s) men.

Participants in the PAMS project completed replicate single day trials that involved wearing a Sensewear armband (SWA) monitor for 24 hours followed by a telephone administered 24-hour physical activity recall (PAR). Comprehensive statistical model selection and validation procedures were used to develop and test separate calibration models designed to predict objectively - measured SB and moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA from self-reported PAR data. Equivalence testing was used to evaluate the equivalence of the model- predicted values with the objective measures in a separate holdout sample. The final prediction model for both SB and MVPA included reported time spent in SB and MVPA, as well as terms capturing sex, age, education, and BMI. Cross-validation analyses on an independent sample exhibited high correlations with observed SB (r = 0.72) and MVPA (r = 0.75). Equivalence testing demonstrated that the model- predicted values were statistically equivalent to the corresponding objective values for both SB and MVPA. The results demonstrate that simple regression models can be used to statistically adjust for over or underestimation in self-report measures among different segments of the population. The models produced group estimates from the PAR that were statistically equivalent to the observed time spent in SB and MVPA obtained from the objective SWA monitor; however additional work is needed to correct for estimates of individual behavior."}

Perturbation of the immune response is implicated in the pathogenesis of perinatal brain injury; modulating this response could thus be a novel therapy for treating or preventing such injury. The immunomodulatory properties of hAECs have been shown in other animal models, but a detailed investigation of the effects on brain immune cells following injury has not been undertaken. Here, we investigate the effects of hAECs on microglia, the first immune responders to injury within the brain. We generated a mouse model combining neonatal inflammation and perinatal hyperoxia, both of which are risk factors associated with perinatal brain injury. On embryonic day 16 we administered lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or saline (control), intra-amniotically to C57Bl/6 J mouse pups. On postnatal day (P)0, LPS pups were placed in hyperoxia (65% oxygen) and control pups in normoxia for 14 days. Pups were given either hAECs or saline intravenously on P4. At P14, relative to controls, LPS and hyperoxia pups had reduced body weight, increased density of apoptotic cells (TUNEL) in the cortex, striatum and white matter, astrocytes (GFAP) in the white matter and activated microglia (CD68) in the cortex and striatum, but no change in total microglia density (Iba1). hAEC administration rescued the decreased body weight and reduced apoptosis and astrocyte areal coverage in the white matter, but increased the density of total and activated microglia. We then stimulated primary microglia (CD45 (low) CD11b (+)) with LPS for 24 h, followed by co-culture with hAEC conditioned medium for 48 h. hAEC conditioned medium increased microglial phagocytic activity, decreased microglia apoptosis and decreased M1 activation markers (CD86).

DNA methylation has been suggested as one of the underlying mechanisms for recurrent disease and its contribution to the development of drug resistance remains to be clarified. This study aimed to determine the methylation phenotype in CRC for identification of predictive markers for chemotherapy response. We performed DNA methylation profiling on 43 non-recurrent and five recurrent CRC patients using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 Beadchip assay. In addition, CRC cells with different genetic backgrounds, response to 5-FU and global methylation levels (HT29 and SW48) were treated with 5-FU and DNA methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-azadC). The singular and combined effects of these two drug classes on cell viability and global methylation profiles were investigated. Our genome-wide methylation study on the clinical specimens showed that recurrent CRCs exhibited higher methylation levels compared to non-recurrent CRCs. We identified 4787 significantly differentially methylated genes (P < 0.05); 3112 genes were hyper - while 1675 genes were hypomethylated in the recurrent group compared to the non-recurrent. Fifty eight and 47 of the significantly hypermethylated and hypomethylated genes have an absolute recurrent / non-recurrent methylation difference of \u226520%. Most of the hypermethylated genes were involved in the MAPK signaling pathway which is a key regulator for apoptosis while the hypomethylated genes were involved in the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway and proliferation process.

High forces occurring at the patellofemoral articulation coupled with a small patellofemoral contact area pose substantial design challenges. In this study, the three-dimensional (3D) in vivo mechanics of domed and anatomically shaped patellar components were compared with those of native patellae. Ten normal knees, 10 treated with an LCS-PS (low contact stress-posterior stabilized) TKA (anatomically shaped patellar component), and 10 treated with a PFC Sigma RP-PS (press-fit condylar Sigma rotating platform-posterior stabilized) TKA (domed patellar component) were analyzed under fluoroscopic surveillance while the patient performed a weight-bearing deep knee bend from full knee extension to maximum knee flexion. Relevant bone geometries were segmented out from computed tomography (CT) scans, and computer-assisted-design (CAD) models of the implanted components were obtained from the manufacturer. Three-dimensional patellofemoral kinematics were obtained using a 3D -to- 2D registration process. Contact mechanics were calculated using a distance map between the articulating patellar and femoral surfaces. Both patellar component designs exhibited good rotational kinematics and tracked well within the femoral trochlea when compared with the normal patella. The contact areas in the TKA groups peaked at 60\u00b0 of knee flexion (mean and standard deviation, 201 \u00b1 63.4 mm for the LCS-PS group and 218 \u00b1 95.4 mm for the Sigma RP-PS group), and the areas were substantially smaller than those previously reported for the normal patella.

The present study aimed to evaluate the role of fibulin-5 in the neuroprotection of RIPostC against cerebral ischaemia / reperfusion (I/R) injury in rats. The middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was established in rats and then RIPostC was carried out by three cycles of 10 minutes occlusion /10 minutes release of the bilateral femoral artery at the beginning of the reperfusion. To downregulate the fibulin-5 level, fibulin-5 siRNA was injected into the lateral ventricle 24 hours before MCAO. According to our present study, RIPostC attenuated cerebral I / R injury by decreasing infarct volume, improving neurobehavioral score and suppressing blood brain barrier (BBB) leakage. Moreover, the mRNA and protein levels of fibulin-5 were upregulated by RIPostC at 24 hours and 72 hours after reperfusion. Downregulation of fibulin-5 attenuated the neuroprotection of RIPostC. Finally, the result showed that fibulin-5 was upregulated by RIPostC via activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway.

The retinal chromophore sterically constrained inside rhodopsin proteins represents an outstanding example of such a control. In a more general framework, mechanical forces acting on a molecular system can strongly modify its reactivity. Herein, we show that the exertion of tensile forces on a simplified retinal chromophore model provokes a substantial and regular increase in the trans-to-cis photoisomerization quantum yield in a counterintuitive way, as these extension forces facilitate the formation of the more compressed cis photoisomer. A rationale for the mechanochemical effect on this photoisomerization mechanism is also proposed."}

Yet, the growing worldwide popularity of another form of tobacco consumption, water pipe smoking, has received relatively less attention. To the best of our knowledge, no study to date has evaluated the effects of water pipe smoking on cytochrome P450 (CYP450) activities and drug interaction potential in humans, whereas only limited information is available on the impact of secondhand smoke on drug metabolism. In a sample of 99 healthy volunteers (28 water pipe smokers, 30 secondhand tobacco smoke exposed persons, and 41 controls), we systematically compared CYP1A2 and CYP2A6 enzyme activities in vivo using caffeine urine test. The median self-reported duration of water pipe smoking was 7.5 h / week and 3 years of exposure in total. The secondhand smoke group had a median of 14 h of self-reported weekly exposure to tobacco smoke indoor where a minimum of five cigarettes were smoked / hour for a total of 3.5 years (median). Analysis of variance did not find a significant difference in CYP1A2 and CYP2A6 activities among the three study groups (p > 0.05). Nor was there a significant association between the extent of water pipe or secondhand smoke exposure and the CYP1A2 and CYP2A6 activities (p > 0.05). Further analysis in a subsample with smoke exposure more than the median values also did not reveal a significant difference from the controls. Although we do not rule out an appreciable possible impact of water pipe smoke and secondhand smoke on in vivo activities of these two drug metabolism pathways, variability in smoke constituents from different tobacco consumption methods (e.g., water pipe) might affect drug metabolism in ways that might differ from that of cigarette smoke. Further studies in larger prospective samples are recommended to evaluate water pipe and secondhand tobacco smoke effects on CYP450 function, particularly at higher smoke exposure conditions."}

It is well known that composition, electric charge, wettability and roughness of implant surfaces have great influence on their interaction with the biological fluids and tissues, but systematic studies of different materials in the same experimental conditions are still lacking in the scientific literature. The aim of this research is to investigate the correlations between some surface characteristics (wettability, zeta potential and hydroxylation degree) and the biological response (protein adsorption, blood wettability, cell and bacterial adhesion) to some model biomaterials. The resulting knowledge can be applied for the development of future innovative surfaces for implantable biomaterials. Roughness was not considered as a variable because it is a widely explored feature: smooth surfaces prepared by a controlled protocol were compared in order to have no roughness effects. Three oxides (ZrO2, Al2O3, SiO2), three metals (316LSS steel, Ti, Nb) and two polymers (corona treated polystyrene for cell culture and untreated polystyrene for bacteria culture), widely used for biomedical applications, were considered. The surfaces were characterized by contact profilometry, SEM - EDS, XPS, FTIR, zeta potential and wettability with different fluids. Protein adsorption, blood wettability, bacterial and cell adhesion were evaluated in order to investigate the correlations between the surface physiochemical properties and biological responses. From a methodological standpoint, XPS and electrokinetic measurements emerged as the more suitable techniques respectively for the evaluation of hydroxylation degree and surface charge / isoelectric point. Moreover, determination of wettability by blood appeared a specific and crucial test, the results of which are not easily predictable by using other type of tests. Hydroxylation degree resulted correlated to the wettability by water, but not directly to surface charge. Wetting tests with different media showed the possibility to highlight some differences among look-alike materials. A dependence of protein absorption on hydroxylation degree, charge and wettability was evidenced and its maximum was registered for surfaces with low wettability in both water based and protein containing media and a moderate surface charge.

We performed a basin-wide analysis of pre-Columbian impacts on Amazonian forests by overlaying known archaeological sites in Amazonia with the distributions and abundances of 85 woody species domesticated by pre-Columbian peoples. Domesticated species are five times more likely than nondomesticated species to be hyperdominant. Across the basin, the relative abundance and richness of domesticated species increase in forests on and around archaeological sites. In southwestern and eastern Amazonia, distance to archaeological sites strongly influences the relative abundance and richness of domesticated species. Our analyses indicate that modern tree communities in Amazonia are structured to an important extent by a long history of plant domestication by Amazonian peoples."}

The OH-PCBs most frequently detected were pentachloro, hexachloro, and heptachloro congeners, which are structurally similar to thyroid hormones. Pentachlorophenol (PCP) was detected at highest concentrations (1.8 ng/g) in fish from Prince Edward Bay, the Bay of Quinte Lake reference site, and Hillman Marsh (the Wheatley Harbour reference site), suggesting local sources of contamination. Elevated PCP concentrations were also detected in the plasma of brown bullhead from exposed sites in the Toronto and Region AOC (0.4-0.6 ng/g). Triclosan was consistently detected in the Toronto and Region AOC (0.05-0.9 ng/g), consistent with wastewater emission.

We found substantial individual variation in resistance and tolerance to the fungal pathogen Metarhizium anisopliae Ma549 using the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP). In addition, we found that host defense to Ma549 was correlated with defense to the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa Pa14, and several previously published DGRP phenotypes including oxidative stress sensitivity, starvation stress resistance, hemolymph glucose levels, and sleep indices. We identified polymorphisms associated with differences between lines in both their mean survival times and microenvironmental plasticity, suggesting that lines differ in their ability to adapt to variable pathogen exposures. The majority of polymorphisms increasing resistance to Ma549 were sex biased, located in non-coding regions, had moderately large effect and were rare, suggesting that there is a general cost to defense. Nevertheless, host defense was not negatively correlated with overall longevity and fecundity. In contrast to Ma549, minor alleles were concentrated in the most Pa14 - susceptible as well as the most Pa14 - resistant lines. A pathway based analysis revealed a network of Pa14 and Ma549 - resistance genes that are functionally connected through processes that encompass phagocytosis and engulfment, cell mobility, intermediary metabolism, protein phosphorylation, axon guidance, response to DNA damage, and drug metabolism. Functional testing with insertional mutagenesis lines indicates that 12/13 candidate genes tested influence susceptibility to Ma549. Many candidate genes have homologs identified in studies of human disease, suggesting that genes affecting variation in susceptibility are conserved across species."}

Family members are often called upon to make decisions for an incapacitated relative. Yet they have difficulty predicting a loved one's desire to receive treatments in hypothetical situations. We tested the hypothesis that this difficulty could in part be explained by discrepant quality-of-life assessments. The data come from 235 community-dwelling adults aged 70 years and over who rated their quality of life and desire for specified interventions in four health states (current state, mild to moderate stroke, incurable brain cancer, and severe dementia). All ratings were made on Likert-type scales. Using identical rating scales, a surrogate chosen by the older adult was asked to predict the latter's responses. Linear mixed models were fitted to determine whether differences in quality-of-life ratings between the older adult and surrogate were associated with surrogates' inaccuracy in predicting desire for treatment. The difference in quality-of-life ratings was a significant predictor of prediction inaccuracy for the three hypothetical health states (p < 0.01) and nearly significant for the current health state (p = 0.077). All regression coefficients were negative, implying that the more the surrogate overestimated quality of life compared to the older adult, the more he or she overestimated the older adult 's desire to be treated. Discrepant quality-of-life ratings are associated with surrogates' difficulty in predicting desire for life-sustaining interventions in hypothetical situations. This finding underscores the importance of discussing anticipated quality of life in states of cognitive decline, to better prepare family members for making difficult decisions for their loved ones.

The purpose of this study was to identify the genetic and functional determinants underlying a Dutch family that presented with a combined phenotype of ventricular arrhythmias with a likely adrenergic component, either in isolation or in combination with a mildly decreased heart function and early onset (<55 years) atrial fibrillation. We performed next generation sequencing in the proband of a two- generation Dutch family and demonstrated a novel missense mutation in SCN5A-(p.M1851V) which co-segregated with the clinical phenotype in the family. We functionally evaluated the putative genetic defect by patch clamp electrophysiological studies in human embryonic kidney cells transfected with mutant or wild-type Nav1.5. The current inactivation was slower and recovery from inactivation was faster in SCN5A-M1851V channels. The voltage dependence of inactivation was shifted towards more positive potentials and consequently, a larger TTX - sensitive window current was observed in SCN5A-M1851V channels. Furthermore, a higher upstroke velocity was observed for the SCN5A-M1851V channels, while the depolarization voltage was more negative, both indicating increased excitability. This mutation leads to a gain-of-function mechanism based on increased channel availability and increased window current, fitting the observed clinical phenotype of (likely adrenergic-induced) ventricular arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation. These findings further expand the range of cardiac arrhythmias associated with mutations in SCN5A."}

In contrast with the 34 moles of ATP produced by respiration, fermentation produces two moles of ATP per mole of glucose consumed, which poses a puzzle on the function of the Warburg effect. Productions of free energy (\u0394G), enthalpy (\u0394H) and entropy (\u0394S) per mole linearly vary with the fraction (x) of glucose consumed by fermentation that is frequently estimated around 0.9. Hence, calculation shows that, in respect to pure respiration, the predominant fermentative metabolism decreases around 10% the production of entropy per mole of glucose consumed in cancer cells. We hypothesize that increased fermentation could allow cancer cells to accomplish the Prigogine theorem of the trend to minimize the rate of production of entropy. According the theorem, open cellular systems near the steady state could evolve to minimize the rates of entropy production that may be reached by modified replicating cells producing entropy at low rate. Remarkably, at CO2 concentrations above 930 ppm, glucose respiration produces less entropy than fermentation, which suggests experimental tests to validate the hypothesis of minimization of the rate of entropy production through the Warburg effect."}

Online database systems were used to examine DDIs on the prescriptions of patients (n = 1206). The clinical severity of DDIs was classified by the Lexi-Interact Online database. Of the 5059 prescriptions, 33% were found to have DDIs. We detected 29 (0.9%) A, 380 (11.8%) B, 2494 (77.7%) C, 289 (9%) D, and 18 (0.6%) X risk rating category DDIs among the prescriptions. Prescriptions of female patients and patients aged between 65 and 72 years showed significantly higher number of DDIs. The frequency of DDIs increased both with the number of drugs and combined preparations per prescription. Acetylsalicylic acid and salbutamol were the most frequently prescribed drugs contributing to clinically important DDIs. Additionally, acetylsalicylic acid and escitalopram, which interact with each other, were found on the list of Beers criteria. The most predicted clinical outcomes of DDIs were increase in therapeutic efficacy and adverse / toxic reactions. Conclusions: Prediction of DDIs in elderly patients will provide better prescribing and drug safety.

Women with resectable breast cancer from 1990 to 2007 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (n = 199,963) were analyzed. The outcome events of breast cancer were classified as breast cancer-specific death (BCSD), non-BCSD, or survival. Binary logistics was used to estimate the occurrence rates of non-BCSD and BCSD with different clinicopathological factors. The Gray method was used to measure the cumulative incidence of non-BCSD and BCSD. The ratio of non-BCSDs to all causes of death and stacked cumulative incidence function plots were used to present the impact of non-BCSD on overall survival (OS). Models of Cox proportional hazards regression and competing risk regression were compared to highlight the suitable model. There were 12,879 non-BCSDs (6.44%) and 28,784 BCSDs (14.39%). The oldest age group (>62 years), black race, and a single or divorced marital status were associated with more non-BCSDs. With adjustments for age, a hormone receptor-positive (HoR+) status was no longer related to increased non-BCSD s. In patients with grade 1, stage I disease and an HoR+ status as well as the oldest subgroup, a great dilution of non-BCSD on all causes of death could be observed, and this led to incorrect interpretations. The inaccuracy, caused by the commonly used Cox proportional hazards model, could be corrected by a competing risk model. OS was largely impaired by non-BCSD during early breast cancer. For some future clinical trial planning, especially for the oldest patients and those with HoR+ breast cancer, non-BCSD should be considered a competing risk event.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can be used to complement existing techniques and could be advantageous in treatment planning due to its larger field of view. In this paper we propose a semi-automatic method to segment surface models of the acetabulum from MRI images. The method incorporates clinical knowledge in the form of intensity priors which are integrated into a Random Walker (RW) formulation. We use a modified RW framework which compensates for incomplete or blurred boundaries in the image by using information from neighboring slices in the sequence incorporated as node weights. We conducted a pilot study to evaluate the segmentation on a set of 10 infant hip MRI sequences using a 1.5 Tesla MR scanner. Contours obtained from the semi-automated segmentation were compared against manually segmented hip contours using Dice Ratio (DR), Hausdorff Distance (HD) and Root Mean Square (RMS) distance. The proposed method gave values of (DR = 0.84 \u00b1 0.5, HD =3.0 \u00b1 0.7, RMS =1.9 \u00b1 0.3) and (DR =0.86 \u00b1 0.2, HD =3.0 \u00b1 0.1, RMS = 2.0 \u00b1 0.6) for right and left acetabular contours respectively which was higher than the corresponding values obtained from conventional RW segmentation.

The demographic variables, sample entropy of GRF and GRM, and impulse difference of bilateral foot were considered as potential explanatory variables of risk assessment model. Firstly, we investigated whether different groups could present difference in every variable. Statistical differences were found for the following variables: age (p=2.28e-05); impulse difference (p=0.02036); sample entropy of GRF in vertical direction (p=0.0144); sample entropy of GRM in anterior-posterior direction (p=0.0387).

However, malignant UTC specimens often contain degenerative changes, and this limits the number of malignant cells meeting all 4 TPS cytomorphologic criteria. One hundred twelve UTC specimens from patients with a subsequent diagnosis of HGUC were reviewed and reclassified according to TPS criteria. The presence of TPS cytomorphologic criteria for HGUC in each specimen was recorded, as was the proportion of atypical cells meeting all 4 criteria. The number of specimens definitively diagnosed as HGUC did not significantly change upon reclassification. However, approximately 40% of indeterminate specimens (21 of 51) were reclassified into a higher risk category. The most restrictive cytomorphologic criterion was an N/C ratio of 0.7 or higher (seen in 78% of specimens), and approximately half of specimens containing all 4 cytomorphologic criteria did not meet TPS 's numerical criterion for HGUC (at least 5 malignant cells). In the majority of specimens qualifying for HGUC by TPS standards, only a small fraction of atypical cells (10%-20%) met all the criteria.

Deletion of the Ca(2+) channel Orai1 in pancreatic acini of adult mice resulted in 60%-70% mortality within 3 weeks. Despite robust activation of the intestinal innate immune response, mice lacking acinar Orai1 exhibited intestinal bacterial outgrowth and dysbiosis, ultimately causing systemic translocation, inflammation, and death. While digestive enzyme supplementation was ineffective, treatments constraining bacterial outgrowth (purified liquid diet, broad-spectrum antibiotics) rescued survival, feeding, and weight gain.

Recently, CXCL5 / CXCR2 has been found to play an oncogenic role in many human cancers. However, the exact role of CXCL5 in osteosarcoma cell migration and invasion has not been revealed. Here we found that the protein expression of CXCL5 was significantly increased in osteosarcoma tissues compared with that in matched adjacent nontumor tissues. Moreover, the expression of CXCL5 was significantly associated with advanced clinical stage and metastasis. Further investigation showed that the CXCL5 expression levels were also significantly increased in osteosarcoma cell lines, including Saos-2, MG63, U2OS, and SW1353, when compared with those in normal osteoblast hFoB1.19 cells. U2OS cells were further transfected with CXCL5 - specific siRNA or overexpression plasmid. Knockdown of CXCL5 significantly suppressed U2OS cell migration and invasion. On the contrary, overexpression of CXLC5 remarkably promoted the migration and invasion of U2OS cells. Interestingly, both exogenous CXCL5 treatment and the conditioned medium of CXCL5 - overexpressing hFoB1.19 cells could also enhance the migration and invasion of U2OS cells, suggesting that the promoting role of CXCL5 in U2OS cell migration and invasion is also in a paracrine -dependent manner. According to these data, our study demonstrates that CXCL5 is upregulated in osteosarcoma and may play an oncogenic role in osteosarcoma metastasis.

We detail a computational procedure to seamlessly perform enrichment, fine-mapping and colocalization analyses, which is a distinct feature compared to the existing colocalization analysis procedures in the literature. The proposed approach is computationally efficient and requires only summary - level statistics. We evaluate and demonstrate the proposed computational approach through extensive simulation studies and analyses of blood lipid data and the whole blood eQTL data from the GTEx project. In addition, a useful utility from our proposed method enables the computation of expected colocalization signals using simple characteristics of the association data. Using this utility, we further illustrate the importance of enrichment analysis on the ability to discover colocalized signals and the potential limitations of currently available molecular QTL data. The software pipeline that implements the proposed computation procedures, enloc, is freely available at https://github.com/xqwen/integrative."}

Minor growth defect \" bugs \" detected in synXII, caused by deletion of tRNA genes, were rescued by introducing an ectopic copy of a single tRNA gene. The ribosomal gene cluster (rDNA) on synXII was left intact during the assembly process and subsequently replaced by a modified rDNA unit used to regenerate rDNA at three distinct chromosomal locations. The signature sequences within rDNA, which can be used to determine species identity, were swapped to generate a Saccharomyces synXII strain that would be identified as Saccharomyces bayanus by standard DNA barcoding procedures."}

The first design mimics the pores in human skin, in which pre-cut flaps open to produce pores in Nafion sheets when humidity increases, as might occur during human sweating thus permitting air flow and reducing both the humidity level and the apparent temperature. Like the smart human sweating pores, the flaps can close automatically after the perspiration to keep the wearer warm. The second design involves thickness adjustable clothes by inserting the bent polymer sheets between two fabrics. As the humidity increases, the sheets become thinner, thus reducing the gap between the two fabrics to reduce the thermal insulation. The insulation layer can recover its original thickness upon humidity reduction to restore its warmth-preservation function. Such humidity sensitive smart polymer materials can be utilized to adjust personal comfort, and be effective in reducing energy consumption for building heating or cooling with numerous smart design."}

A model providing insight into the electrical activation events would be useful to guide catheter ablation strategy. Method A two-dimensional, 576\u00d7576 node automaton was developed to simulate atrial electrical activity. The substrate field was altered by the presence of differing refractory period at varying locations. Fibrosis was added in the form of short, randomly positioned lines of conduction block. Larger areas of block were used to simulate ablation lesions. Anisotropy was imposed in a 2:1 ratio. A premature electrical impulse from one of four grid corners was utilized to initiate activation. Rotational activity was uninducible when refractory patch dimensions were less than 20\u00d720mm. For larger refractory regions, a single premature stimulus was capable of inducing an average of 1.19\u00b11.10 rotors, which often formed near the patch edges. A maximum of 5 rotors formed when refractory patch dimensions approached the size of the entire left atrial virtual field. Rotors formed along a refractory patch edge, after wavefront arrival was delayed at turning points or due to the presence of a fiber cluster of sufficient size. However, rotational activity could also occur around a large fiber cluster without the need of spatially variable refractoriness. When obstacles to conduction were lacking in size, nascent rotors drifted and either extinguished, or stabilized upon anchoring at a sufficiently large fiber cluster elsewhere in the field. Transient rotors terminated when traversing a region with differing refractory periods, if no obstacle to conduction was present to sufficiently delay wavefront arrival beyond the longest refractory period. Other rotors were annihilated when a nearby rotor with faster spin rate gradually interrupted the activation pathway. Elimination of anchors by removal, or by simulated ablation over a sufficient region, prevented rotor onset at a particular location where it would otherwise form. The presence of obstacles to conduction and spatial differences in refractory period are important parameters for initiating and maintaining rotational activity in this simulation of an atrial substrate."}

In addition, continuous blood pressure measurements which comply with MEG compatibility requirements are lacking. For instance, by combining methods reflecting neurovascular status one could obtain more information on low frequency fluctuations that have recently gained increasing interest as a mediator of functional connectivity within brain networks. This paper presents a multimodal brain imaging setup, capable to non-invasively and continuously measure cerebral hemodynamic, cardiorespiratory and blood pressure oscillations simultaneously with MEG. In the setup, all methods apart from MEG rely on the use of fibre optics. In particular, we present a method for measuring of blood pressure and cardiorespiratory oscillations continuously with MEG. The potential of this type of multimodal setup for brain research is demonstrated by our preliminary studies on human, showing effects of mild hypercapnia, gathered simultaneously with the presented modalities."}

Mechanisms underlying the observed cardiovascular differences between DPP4i and GLP1-RA, and across individual GLP1-RA are poorly understood. This review is aimed at collecting and summarizing available evidence from experimental and mechanistic studies on the action of GLP1-RA and DPP4i on the cardiovascular system, both deriving from clinical and pre-clinical sources. The results of cardiovascular outcome trials are interpreted on the basis of the experimental preclinical data available, paying particular attention to the heart failure results, and suggesting some novel intriguing hypotheses to explain some of the unexpected findings of cardioprotection of incretin -based drugs. In particular, we discuss the possible contribution to the incretin cardiovascular effects of a direct cardiac action of GLP-1 metabolites through GLP-1 receptor -independent pathways, and of DPP4 substrates other than GLP-1."}

This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of breast MR imaging in detecting remnant LCIS lesions after initial excision. Between 2011 and 2015, 29 patients with LCIS who underwent initial excision were enrolled. Breast ultrasonography and breast MR imaging was conducted after initial excision. Imaging findings were compared with pathologic results. There were nine (31.0%) cases with positive margins after initial excision; they were LCIS (n=8) and atypical lobular hyperplasia (n=1). Residual lesions were identified in 12 cases; they were invasive lobular carcinoma (n=1; 3.4%), LCIS (n=9; 31.0%), atypical lobular hyperplasia (n=1; 3.4%), and papillary carcinoma in situ (n=1; 3.4%). Prior to the second operation, these lesions could be detected in seven cases using ultrasonography (sensitivity, 53.3%; specificity, 100%) and in 10 cases using breast MR imaging (sensitivity, 83.3%; specificity, 100%). Breast MR imaging showed higher sensitivity than breast ultrasonography in detecting remnant LCIS lesions. If a suspicious lesion was found using breast MR imaging, a second operation should be considered because of the possibility of multifocality, even if LCIS was confirmed at the initial operation."}

Recent technical developments in biology and medicine, from single cell techniques to big data computational research, have enabled new approaches for study of biology of low doses of radiation. Results of the work done so far support the idea that low doses of radiation have effects that differ from those associated with high dose exposures; this work, however, is far from sufficient for the development of a new theoretical framework needed for the understanding of low dose radiation exposures. Mechanistic understanding of radiation effects at low doses is necessary in order to develop better radiation protection policy."}

The majority of studies validating this revision have been in Caucasian populations. We therefore asked whether the new GG system was retrospectively associated with biochemical disease-free survival in a mixed-ethnicity cohort of Asian men. A total of 680 radical prostatectomies (RPs) from 2005 to 2014 were included. GS from initial biopsy and RP were compared and used to allocate cases to GG, defined as: 1 (GS \u22646); 2 (GS 3+4=7); 3 (GS 4+3=7); 4 (GS 4+4=8/5+3=8/3+5=8) and 5 (GS 9-10). Biochemical recurrence was defined as two consecutive post- RP prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels of >0.2 ng/mL after post- RP PSA reaching the nadir of <0.1 ng/mL. Our data showed that Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed significant differences in biochemical recurrence within Gleason GG based on either biopsy or prostatectomy scoring. Multivariate analysis further confirmed that a higher GG was significantly associated with risk of biochemical recurrence. This GG system had a higher prognostic discrimination for both initial biopsy and RP than GS. Our study validates the use of the revised and updated GG system in a mixed-ethnicity population of Asian men. Higher GG was significantly associated with increased risk of biochemical recurrence. We therefore recommend its use to inform clinical management for patients with prostate cancer."}

The comprehension of the dynamics of primary blast injury mechanisms is a challenging issue. The question is whether the pressure wave propagation and reflection alone could cause ocular damage. To date, there are dissenting opinions and no conclusive evidence thereupon. A previous numerical investigation of blast trauma highlighted the dynamic effect of pressure propagation and its amplification by the geometry of the bony orbit, inducing a resonance cavity effect and a standing wave hazardous for eye tissues. The objective of the current work is to find experimental evidence of the numerically identified phenomenon. Therefore, tests aimed at evaluating the response of porcine eyes to blast overpressure generated by firecrackers explosion were performed. The orbital cavity effect was considered mounting the enucleated eyes inside a dummy orbit. The experimental measurements obtained during the explosion tests presented in this paper corroborate the numerical evidence of a high-frequency pressure amplification, enhancing the loading on the ocular tissues, attributable to the orbital bony walls surrounding the eye."}

CLEC-2 plays an essential role in liver regeneration after HPx. Background and aim The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of C-type lectin receptor (CLEC)-2 in liver regeneration following partial liver resection in mice. Materials and methods Irradiated chimeric mice transplanted with fetal liver cells from wild-type (WT) mice, CLEC-2 - deleted (KO) mice or mice with CLEC-2 deleted specifically from platelets (flKO) were generated. Mice underwent 70% partial hepatectomy (PH). Immunohistochemical staining was performed to investigate the expression of the endogenous ligand for CLEC-2, podoplanin. The accumulation of platelets in the liver was also quantified. The hepatic expression of the IL-6 / gp130 and STAT3, Akt and ERK1/2 was also examined. Results The liver/body weight ratio and expression of all cell proliferation markers were significantly lower in the flKO group than in the WT group. The expression of phosphorylated (p) Akt and pERK1 /2 was similar in the WT and flKO groups. On the other hand, the expression of pSTAT3 and IL-6 was significantly stronger in the WT group than in the flKO group. The expression of podoplanin was detected in the hepatic sinusoids of both groups. However, the extent to which platelets accumulated in hepatic sinusoids was significantly less in the flKO group than in the WT group. "}

The FDA also suggested that 6 months would be the most appropriate length for a clinical trial to demonstrate the stability of this nonabstinent drinking outcome. However, few alcohol clinical trials have examined the stability of nonheavy drinking during and after treatment. In a secondary analysis of the COMBINE study data (n = 1,383), we examined transitions in heavy drinking days during the course of treatment (months 1 through 4), during the transition out of treatment (months 4 through 7), and up to 12 months afterward (months 13 through 16) using latent variable mixture models. Heavy drinking and nonheavy drinking were relatively stable in consecutive months (minimum agreement [kappa] = 0.64 for months 1 to 2). Most individuals were stable low-risk drinkers / abstainers or heavy drinkers by the end of treatment, as characterized by a 10% probability (or less) of transitioning out of either a no heavy drinking state or a heavy drinking state. More than two-thirds of the heavy drinkers who exceeded the heavy drinking threshold during treatment reported, on average, a 64% reduction in drinking frequency and a 38% reduction in drinking intensity from pretreatment drinking levels. The results show stability of no heavy drinking as an outcome within the first 4 months of treatment and that the >3/>4 drink cutoff may mask substantial reductions in alcohol consumption among some patients. Future studies should explore the clinical utility of reduction end points."}

This widely touted example of the mismatch between our biology and modern lifestyle has been intuited largely from the bioarchaeological record of the Neolithic Revolution in the New World. Recent studies of other populations have, however, challenged the universality of this assertion. Here, we present the first comprehensive study of oral health among a living population in transition from the bush to village life, the Hadza hunter - gatherers of Tanzania, to test the hypothesis that the shift from foraging to farming, or agricultural intensification, inevitably leads to increased periodontal disease, caries, and orthodontic disorders. Our results showed that women living in villages consuming a mostly agricultural diet exhibited more caries and periodontal disease than those living in the bush consuming a mostly wild-food diet. Furthermore, men living in the bush consuming mostly a wild-food diet had more than those living in the village consuming a mostly agricultural diet. These findings are explained by the high incidence of maize consumption in village settings, along with previously recognized variation in rate of caries between men and women. The unexpected discovery of high caries incidences for men in the bush is likely explained by heavy reliance on honey, and perhaps differential access to tobacco and marijuana. These data support the notions that mechanisms of cariogenesis are multifactorial and that the relationships between oral health and the shift from a predominantly wild-food diet to one dominated by cultigens are nuanced."}

Proanthocyanidins are flavonoids of paramount importance for animal and human diet. Research interest increasingly tilts towards generating crops enriched with these health -promoting compounds. Flavonoids synthesis is regulated by the MBW transcriptional complex, made of R2R3MYB, bHLH and WD40 proteins, with the MYB components liable for channeling the complex towards specific branches of the pathway. Hence, using tobacco as a model, here, we tested if the ectopic expression of the proanthocyanidin regulator VvMYBPA1 from grape induces the biosynthesis of these compounds in not-naturally committed cells. Here, we show, via targeted transcriptomic and metabolic analyses of primary transgenic lines and their progeny, that VvMYBPA1 alters the phenylpropanoid pathway in tobacco floral organs, in a structure-specific fashion. We also report that a modest VvMYBPA1 expression is sufficient to induce the expression of both proanthocyanidin -specific and early genes of the phenylpropanoid pathway. Consequently, proanthocyanidins and chlorogenic acids are induced or de novo synthetised in floral limbs, tubes and stamens. Other phenylpropanoid branches are conversely induced or depleted according to the floral structure. Our study documents a novel and distinct function of VvMYBPA1 with respect to other MYBs regulating proanthocyanidins. Present findings may have major implications in designing strategies for enriching crops with health -promoting compounds."}

In the first year of the trial, a severe attack of barley yellow mosaic virus (BaYMV) strongly influenced final performances with an average reduction of ~ 50% for grain and straw harvested in comparison to the second year. The genetic determination (GD) for grain yield was 0.49 and 0.70, for the two years respectively, and for straw yield GD was low in 2009 (0.09) and higher in 2010 (0.29). Cell wall polymers in culms were quantified by means of the monoclonal antibodies LM6, LM11, JIM13 and BS-400-3 and the carbohydrate-binding module CBM3a using the high-throughput CoMPP technique. Of these, LM6, which detects arabinan components, showed a relatively high GD in both years and a significantly negative correlation with grain yield (GYLD).

In this secondary analysis, we investigated whether the presence of CM results in a differential indication for the Cognitive Behavioral Analysis System of Psychotherapy (CBASP) or escitalopram plus clinical management (ESC). Sixty patients with chronic depression were randomized to either 22 sessions of CBASP or ESC over the course of 8 weeks of acute and 20 weeks of extended treatment at 2 German treatment sites. CM was assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire and the clinician rated Early Trauma Inventory. Intention-to-treat analyses were used to examine the impact of CM on depression, global functioning, and quality of life. The presence of CM did not result in significant differences in treatment response to CBASP or ESC on any outcome measure after 28 weeks of treatment independent of the type of CM assessment. After 8 weeks, a significant CM \u00d7 treatment interaction was found for scores on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale. Patients with a history of CM receiving CBASP had a significantly lower response rate compared to patients without CM and to those receiving ESC after 8 weeks. Conclusively, CBASP and ESC are equally effective treatment options for the difficult to treat subgroup of patients with chronic depression and a history of CM.

NAAG activates a group II metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR3) and is inactivated by an extracellular enzyme, glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII) in vivo. Inhibitors of this enzyme are analgesic in animal models of inflammatory, neuropathic and bone cancer pain. NAAG and GCPII are present in the locus coeruleus, a center for the descending noradrenergic inhibitory pain system. In the formalin footpad model, systemic treatment with GCPII inhibitors reduces both phases of the inflammatory pain response and increases release of spinal noradrenaline. This analgesic efficacy is blocked by systemic injection of a group II mGluR antagonist, by intrathecal (spinal) injection of an alpha 2 adrenergic receptor antagonist and by microinjection of an \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonist directly into the contralateral locus coeruleus. Footpad inflammation increases release of glutamate in the contralateral locus coeruleu s and systemic treatment with a GCPII inhibitor blocks this increase. Direct injection of GCPII inhibitors into the contralateral or ipsilatera l locus coeruleus reduces both phases of the inflammatory pain response in a dose-dependent manner and the contralateral effect also is blocked by intrathecal injection of an alpha 2 adrenergic receptor antagonist. These data support the hypothesis that the analgesic efficacy of systemically administered GCPII inhibitors is mediated, at least in part, by the contralatera l locus coeruleus via group II mGluR, AMPA and alpha 2 adrenergic receptors."}

The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) was utilized to estimate PA levels and analyze the association of PA level with various body composition parameters and the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases by using data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2008 to 2011. Moderate and high PA levels were associated with lower prevalence of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, and lower concentrations of serum ferritin, parathyroid hormone, and alkaline phosphatase. Sarcopenia (low vs. moderate vs. high PA group: 14.3% vs. 10.5% vs. 7.3%, p = 0.001), underweight (5.7% vs. 4.9% vs. 3.5%, p = 0.001), and central obesity (7.8% vs. 6.9% vs. 6.3%, p = 0.002) were more often observed in the low PA group.

In this retrospective observational study, diabetic patients who underwent pancreas transplantation in a single medical center and developed symptomatic acute macular edema and peripapillary soft exudate within 3 months after the operation were enrolled. The complete ophthalmic course and medical records of the patients were retrospectively reviewed. Diabetic retinopathy and progression following treatment after pancreas transplantation were measured. Six Chinese women with type 1 DM were enrolled in this study. Mean hemoglobin (Hb) A1c was 13.4% prior to transplantation and decreased rapidly to 6.5% within 2 months postsurgery. The patients had no or mild pretransplant diabetic retinopathy and developed acute symptomatic macular edema and peripapillary soft exudate in both eyes after pancreas transplantation. All macular edema resolved either with or without treatment. Five cases progressed to proliferative diabetic retinopathy and received panretinal photocoagulation. Diabetic retinopathy remained stable in all eyes after treatment, and the visual prognosis was good, except in one eye that had macular branch retinal artery occlusion with foveal involvement. Acute macular edema after pancreas transplantation has a favorable treatment outcome despite rapid progression to proliferative diabetic retinopathy. High pretransplant HbA1c and abrupt blood sugar normalization may be related to the disease course."}

The impact of stress on anger and aggression in Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) has not been thoroughly investigated. The goal of this study was to investigate different aspects of anger and aggression in patients with these disorders. Twenty-nine unmedicated female BPD patients, 28 ADHD patients and 30 healthy controls (HC) completed self-reports measuring trait anger, aggression and emotion regulation capacities. A modified version of the Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm and a state anger measurement were applied under resting and stress conditions. Stress was induced by the Mannheim Multicomponent Stress Test (MMST). Both patient groups scored significantly higher on all self-report measures compared to HCs. Compared to ADHD patients, BPD patients reported higher trait aggression and hostility, a stronger tendency to express anger when provoked and to direct anger inwardly. Furthermore, BPD patients exhibited higher state anger than HCs and ADHD patients under both conditions and showed a stress-dependent anger increase. At the behavioral level, no significant effects were found. In BPD patients, aggression and anger were positively correlated with emotion regulation deficits. Our findings suggest a significant impact of stress on self-perceived state anger in BPD patients but not on aggressive behavior towards others in females with BPD or ADHD. However, it appears to be pronounced inwardly directed anger which is of clinical importance in BPD patients."}

The ICU's high-intensity environment requires staff's vigilant attention, and distraction from false and non-actionable alarms pulls staff away from important tasks, creates dissatisfaction, and is a potential patient safety risk if alarms are missed or ignored. This project was intended to improve patient safety by optimizing alarm systems in a cardiovascular surgical intensive care unit (CVSICU). Specific aims were to examine nurses ' attitudes toward clinical alarm signals, assess nurses ' ability to discriminate audible alarm signals, and implement a bundled set of best practices for monitor alarm reduction without undermining patient safety. CVSICU nurses completed an alarm perception survey and participated in alarm discriminability testing. Nurse survey data and baseline monitor alarm data were used to select targeted alarm reduction interventions, which were progressively phased in. Monitor alarm data and cardiorespiratory event data were trended over one year. Five of the most frequent CVSICU monitor alarm types- pulse oximetry, heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse oximetry sensor, and ventricular tachycardia > 2-were targeted. After implementation, there was a 61% reduction in average alarms per monitored bed and a downward trend in cardiorespiratory events. To reduce alarm fatigue it is important to decrease alarm burden through targeted interventions. Methods to reduce non-actionable alarms include adding short delays to allow alarm self-correction, adjusting default alarm threshold limits, providing alarm notification through a secondary device, and teaching staff to optimize alarm settings for individual patients."}

On symptom level (i.e. depression scores), robust enrichment was identified for two gene sets: NCAM1 Interactions and Collagen Formation. Depression scores were also associated with decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) - a brain white matter property - within the forceps minor and the left superior temporal longitudinal fasciculus. Within each of these tracts, mean FA value of depression score - associated voxels was used as a phenotype in a subsequent GSEA. The NCAM1 Interactions gene set was significantly enriched in these tracts.

The effectiveness of different categories of opioids, dose, duration, and commonly prescribed opioids varied across studies. Based on a systematic review of the current literature, there is fair evidence for the high prevalence of chronic pain among patients with CKD, which is not being effectively managed, probably due to underprescription of analgesics or opioids in the CKD population.

Patients performed significantly worse than controls in nearly all neurocognitive performances except the forward subscale part of the DST. BDNF levels were inversely correlated to TMT-part B scores and positively correlated to VFT-action in the FEDN group. GDNF levels showed a positive correlation with VFT-action scores and a negative correlation with TMT-part B scores of these patients.

New drugs for alcohol use disorder have been approved, but must be given cautiously and with a full understanding of their potential drug-drug interactions with opioid medications. Opiate - dependent patients should be intensively monitored for risk factors of alcohol use disorder and should be continuously motivated for treatment maintenance.

Furthermore, since the protease is highly conserved between the four Dengue virus serotypes, it is probable that a drug would be equally effective against all of them. In this article, a strategy is reported that allowed us to identify influential residues on the function of the Dengue NS2b-NS3 Protease. Moreover, this is a strategy that could be applied to virtually any protein for the search of alternative influential residues, and for non-competitive inhibitor development. First, we incorporated several features derived from computational alanine scanning mutagenesis, sequence, structure conservation, and other structure -based characteristics. Second, these features were used as variables to obtain a multilayer perceptron model to identify defined groups (clusters) of key residues as possible candidate pockets for binding sites of new leads on the DENV protease. The identified residues included: i) amino acids close to the beta sheet -loop- beta sheet known to be important in its closed conformation for NS2b ii) residues close to the active site, iii) several residues evenly spread on the NS2b-NS3 contact surface, and iv) some inner residues most likely related to the overall stability of the protease.

We investigated this relationship using 64-slice multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) in patients with stable angina pectoris (SAP).Methods and Results:We enrolled 65 patients with SAP who underwent MDCT. Three monocyte subsets (CD14(++)CD16(-), CD14(++)CD16(+), and CD14(+)CD16(+)) and expression of TLR-4 were measured by flow cytometry. Intracoronary plaques were assessed by 64-slice MDCT.

Subsequently, energy features and various entropies namely Yager, Renyi, Kapoor, Shannon, and Fuzzy were extracted from the decomposed images. Then, adaptive synthetic sampling approach was applied to balance the normal and abnormal datasets. Next, the extracted features were ranked according to the significances using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Thereupon, the ranked and selected features were used to train the random forest classifier using stratified 10-fold cross validation. Overall, the proposed system presented a performance rate of 92.48%, and a sensitivity and specificity of 89.37% and 95.58% respectively using 15 features. This novel system shows promise in detecting abnormal fundus images, and hence, could be a valuable adjunct eye health screening tool that could be employed in polyclinics, and thereby reduce the workload of specialists at hospitals."}

We stress the importance of adopting the conceptual framework of \" geroscience \", which starts from the observation that advanced age is the major risk factor for several of these pathologies and aims at identifying the mechanistic links between aging and age - related diseases. DNA methylation undergoes a profound remodeling during aging, which includes global hypomethylation of the genome, hypermethylation at specific loci and an increase in inter-individual variation and in stochastic changes of DNA methylation values. These epigenetic modifications can be an important contributor to the development of age - related diseases, but our understanding on the complex relationship between the epigenetic signatures of aging and age - related disease is still poor. The most relevant results in this field come from the use of the so called \" epigenetics clocks \" in cohorts of subjects affected by age - related diseases. We report these studies in final section of this review."}

Emerging evidence suggests that the high-fructose consumption is a potential and important factor responsible for the rising incidence of IR. The present study investigates the beneficial effects of aqueous extract of Phyllanthus amaru s (PAAE) on IR and oxidative stress in high-fructose (HF) fed male Wistar rats. HF diet (66% of fructose) and PAAE (200 mg/kg body weight/day) were given concurrently to the rats for a period of 60 days. Fructose-fed rats showed weight gain, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, impaired glucose tolerance, impaired insulin sensitivity, dyslipidemia, hyperleptinemia, and hypoadiponectinemia (P < 0.05) after 60 days. Co-administration of PAAE along with HF diet significantly ameliorated all these alterations. Regarding hepatic antioxidant status, higher lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation, lower reduced glutathione levels and lower activities of enzymatic antioxidants, and the histopathological changes like mild to severe distortion of the normal architecture as well as the prominence and widening of the liver sinusoids observed in the HF diet -fed rats were significantly prevented by PAAE treatment. These findings indicate that PAAE is beneficial in improving insulin sensitivity and attenuating metabolic syndrome and hepatic oxidative stress in fructose-fed rats."}

The most solid evidence is for air pollution, leading to increased disability-adjusted life years. Outdoor temperature and other seasonal climate changes may also influence cardiovascular health, according to their direct modulation of air pollution. Moreover, an increasing body of evidence associates environmental exposure to noise with poor cardiovascular outcome, and in particular with hypertension. This review is aimed at reviewing current evidence about the role of these environmental factors in cardiovascular disease and specifically hypertension. In particular, the impact of air pollution, with its short-term and long-term effects, the outdoor temperature and noise pollution will be investigated. People belonging to low social classes, as well as children, women, older people and those with established cardiovascular diseases, seem to have a greater susceptibility to the effects of environmental stressors, recalling the concept of \" environmental justice \". The accumulating strong scientific evidence may thus support public health policies aimed at reducing social inequalities in cardiovascular health."}

Recently, dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota has emerged as a new candidate that may be linked to metabolic diseases. We hypothesize that selective modulation of the intestinal microbiota by probiotic or synbiotic supplementation may improve metabolic dysfunction and prevent diabetes in prediabetics. In this study, a synthesis and study of synbiotics will be carried out for the first time in Iran. In a randomized triple-blind controlled clinical trial, 120 adults with impaired glucose tolerance based on the inclusion criteria will be selected by a simple random sampling method and will be randomly allocated to 6 months of 6 g/d probiotic, synbiotic or placebo. The fecal abundance of bacteria, blood pressure, height, weight, and waist and hip circumferences will be measured at baseline and following treatment. Also, plasma lipid profiles, HbA1C, fasting plasma glucose, and insulin levels, will be measured and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and beta-cell function (HOMA-B) will be calculated at baseline and will be repeated at months 3, 6, 12, and 18. The data will be compared within and between groups using statistical methods. The results of this trial could contribute to the evidence-based clinical guidelines that address gut microbiota manipulation to maximize health benefits in prevention and management of metabolic syndrome in prediabetes.

Partial or total anorexia was reported in all birds and decreased casting in 2 birds. Survey radiographs confirmed presence of gastric enlargement in all 4 birds. The kestrel and eagle were treated unsuccessfully with gastroscopy and gastric lavage, respectively, followed by surgical intervention to remove the ventricular impactions. Both birds died of undetermined causes after surgery. The peregrine falcon died before medical or surgical intervention was started, and the owl was managed successfully with oral mineral oil and liquid diet to facilitate egestion of the foreign material as a pellet. Lead poisoning was suspected as the predisposing cause for foreign body ingestion in the eagle, but underlying causes for pica in the other birds were not determined. Radiographs can provide useful diagnostic information in sick raptors that exhibit vomiting or changes in appetite or casting frequency, and may help guide treatment decisions of impacted birds. Careful consideration of substrate, enrichment items, and access to potential foreign material that could be ingested may be the best pre-emptive management strategy in captive raptors."}

In the present study, the effects of E. angustifolia fruit extract on the acute and chronic phases of formalin - induced rat paw edema were examined. The acute and chronic anti-inflammatory effects of E. angustifolia fruit extract were investigated through the subcutaneous injection of 100 \u03bcL of formalin (2.5%) into a rat's hind paw. Thirty minutes before the procedure, the experimental groups were treated intraperitoneally with hydroalcoholic fruit extracts of E. angustifolia (concentrations of 100, 300, 700, and 1000 mg/kg); sodium salicylate (SS, 400 mg/kg) and distilled water were used as positive and negative control groups, respectively. Treatment with SS and the fruit extracts were performed daily for 8 days, and the degree of edema was measured by using mercury plethysmometer and digital caliper. In the acute anti-inflammatory study, the extract showed a significant anti-inflammatory effect in a dose-dependent manner. The results of 1000 mg/kg of the extract was significantly different compared with the negative control group (p<0.05) and was comparable to sodium salicylate (p<0.05). Results from the chronic study suggested that E. angustifolia extract significantly reduced paw edema and inflammation in a dose-dependent manner. The results also showed that the measurement by digital caliper and mercury plethysmometer were both reliable and might be applied interchangeably (p<0.01). Phytochemical tests indicated that the hydroalcoholic fruit extract of E. angustifolia was positive for cardiac glycosides, flavonoids, terpenoids, and saponins. Based on our findings, the E. angustifolia fruit extract probably has acute and chronic anti-inflammatory activities to support its applications in folk medicine."}

Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) consequent to cephalad fluid shifts is commonly hypothesized as contributing to these ocular changes. Head-down tilt (HDT) is frequently utilized as an Earth -based analog to study similar fluid shifts. Sealed environments like the ISS also exhibit elevated carbon dioxide (CO2), a potent arteriolar vasodilator that could further affect cerebral blood volume and flow, intracranial compliance, and ICP. A collaborative pilot study between the National Space Biomedical Research Institute and the German Aerospace Center tested the hypotheses that: (1) HDT and elevated CO2 physiologically interact, and (2) cerebrovascular pulsatility is related to HDT and/or elevated CO2 In a double-blind crossover study (n=6), we measured cerebral blood volume (CBV) pulsatility via near-infrared spectroscopy, alongside non-invasive ICP and intraocular pressure (IOP) during 28-hr -12\u00b0 HDT at both nominal (0.04%) and elevated (0.5%) ambient CO2 In our cohort, CBV pulsatility increased significantly over time at cardiac frequencies (0.031\u00b10.009 \u03bcM/hr increase in [HbT] pulsatility amplitude) and Mayer wave frequencies (0.019\u00b10.005 \u03bcM/hr increase). The HDT - CO2 interaction on pulsatility was not robust, but rather driven by an individual. Significant differences between atmospheres were not detected in ICP or IOP.

The placenta is comprised of various trophoblastic cells that differentiate from the extra-embryonic trophectoderm cells of the preimplantation blastocyst. As such, our understanding of the early differentiation events of the human placenta is limited because of ethical and legal restrictions on the isolation and manipulation of human embryogenesis. Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are a robust model system for investigating human development and can also be differentiated in vitro into trophoblastic cells that express markers of the various trophoblast cell types. Here, we present a detailed protocol for differentiating hPSCs into trophoblastic cells using bone morphogenic protein 4 and inhibitors of the Activin / Nodal signaling pathways. This protocol generates various trophoblast cell types that can be transfected with siRNAs for investigating loss-of-function phenotypes or can be infected with pathogens. Additionally, hPSCs can be genetically modified and then differentiated into trophoblast progenitors for gain-of-function analyses. This in vitro differentiation method for generating human trophoblasts starting from hPSCs overcomes the ethical and legal restrictions of working with early human embryos, and this system can be used for a variety of applications, including drug discovery and stem cell research."}

Comprehensive metabolite analysis may reveal the anaphylactoid effect mechanism systematically and provide reference for future diagnostic purposes. Plasma from Brown Norway rats given intravenous injection of saline, compound 48/80 (2.5 mL/kg) or ovalbumin (20 mL/kg) in 20 s for the first time was used to study the effect mechanism of anaphylactoid reactions through metabolomics (UPLC-qTOF-MS/MS). Metabolomics integrated with proteomics data were used to analyze the anaphylactoid pathways by MetaboAnalyst followed by integrated pathway analysis. Thirty metabolites were identified through the METLIN database by MS/MS and 18 of them were confirmed by authentic standards. The results showed that adenosine, histamine, N-acetylhistamine, N(\u03b1)-\u03b3-glutamylhistamine, malate and xanthine are important indices for anaphylactoid reactions. It could be concluded that the effect mechanism is mainly composed of histidine metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, energy metabolism, purine metabolism and other small molecules through 30 metabolites. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that not only histamine but also N(\u03b1)-\u03b3-glutamylhistamine and arachidonic acid could be used to evaluate anaphylactoid symptoms of animals. Furthermore, the citrate cycle, histidine metabolism and arachidonic acid metabolism could be the main pathways of anaphylactoid reactions as determined by MetaboAnalyst.

Thrombosis of the false lumen is associated with a prognosis of type B aortic dissection (AoD), and partial thrombosis has been reported to be an independent predictor of mortality. This study sought to explore whether the severity of OSA is associated with false lumen thrombosis. In this observational study, 151 type B AoD patients were recruited consecutively from 2013 to 2015. The status of the false lumen was classified as patent, partially thrombosed, or completely thrombosed based on a computer tomography angiography image. Patients were divided into non-OSA group (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] < 5), and mild (5 \u2264 AHI \u2264 15), moderate (15 < AHI \u2264 30), and severe OSA groups (AHI > 30) using the AHI. The prevalence of OSA in type B dissection was 66.2%. Among 151 cases, 51 patients (33.8%) were in the non-OSA group, 56 (37.1%) were in the mild group, 21 (13.9%) were in the moderate group, and 23 (15.2%) were in the severe group. Additionally, a partially thrombosed false lumen was observed in 88 patients (58.3%). Multivariable analysis revealed that OSA severity was positively associated with partial thrombosis (odds ratio, 1.784, 95% confidence interval: 1.182-2.691, P = .006) after adjusting for other confounding factors. OSA was present in two-thirds of patients with type B AoD. The severity of OSA was significantly associated with an increased risk of partial false lumen thrombosis.

Conventional proliferation assays mainly quantify cell number based on a calibration curve of a homogeneous cell population, and therefore are not applicable for the analysis of cocultured cells. Moreover, these assays measure cell proliferation indirectly, based on cellular metabolic activity or DNA content. To overcome these shortcomings, a dye dilution assay employing fluorescent cell tracking dyes that are retained within cells was applied and was diluted proportionally by subsequent cell divisions. Here, it was demonstrated that this assay could be implemented to quantitatively analyze the cell proliferation of different types of cell lines, and to concurrently analyze the proliferation of two types of cell lines in coculture by utilizing cell tracking dyes with different spectral characteristics. The mean division time estimated by the dye dilution assay is compared with the population doubling time obtained from conventional methods and values from literature. Additionally, dye transfer between cocultured cells was investigated and it was found that it is a characteristic of the cells rather than a characteristic of the dye. It was suggested that this method can be easily combined with other flow cytometric analyses of cellular properties, providing valuable information on cell status under diverse conditions. \u00a9 2017 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry."}

An existing colorimetric method was examined and optimized for the detection of amines in environmental water samples. The method consists of liquid-liquid extraction followed by a catalyzed reaction to form a yet- undefined product that is known to be both a strong chromophore and fluorophore. Previous work verified that this reaction was effectively catalyzed by a number of compounds containing tertiary and quaternary amine moieties. Many tertiary and quaternary compounds are also efficient producers of NDMA under chloramination conditions, and a linear correlation was consequently derived from the bulk amine signals vs. NDMA formation potential in various wastewater samples (R(2) = 0.74; n = 24; p-value < 0.05). The results provide evidence that approximately 2% of the tertiary and quaternary amines measured can form NDMA and an estimated 0.01-1.3% of nitrogen in dissolved organic nitrogen originates from these bulk amines. The normalization of NDMA concentration by the amine measurement revealed that ozone effectively destroyed those tertiary and quaternary amine structures more likely to form NDMA in treated wastewater samples. This bulk amine assay illustrates that proxy measurements of tertiary and quaternary amines can be linked to the NDMA formation potential of a given sample, and this approach may prove useful as a characterizing tool for NDMA precursors in wastewater."}

Therefore, we investigated the effect of C. pneumoniae infection on angiogenesis, and then explored the roles of IQGAP1 -related signaling in C. pneumoniae infection - induced angiogenesis. C. pneumoniae infection significantly enhanced angiogenesis as assessed by the tube formation assay possibly by inducing vascular endothelial cell (VEC) migration in the wound healing and Transwell migration assays. Subsequently, immunoprecipitation, Western blot and tube formation assay results showed that the phosphorylation of both IQGAP1 and N-WASP was required for the angiogenesis induced by C. pneumoniae infection. Our co-immunoprecipitation study revealed that IQGAP1 physically associated with N-WASP after C. pneumoniae infection of VECs. Actin polymerization assay further showed that in C. pneumoniae - infected VECs, both IQGAP1 and N-WASP were recruited to filamentous actin, and shared some common compartments localized at the leading edge of lamellipodia, which was impaired after the depletion of IQGAP1 by using the small interference RNA. Moreover, the knockdown of IQGAP1 also significantly decreased N-WASP phosphorylation at Tyr256 induced by C. pneumoniae infection.

This is hardly surprising, given that there is no agreement even as regards the most fundamental issues they involve. One of the basic disagreements present in the continuing debate about consciousness pertains to its gradational nature. The general aim of this article is to show how consciousness might be graded and multidimensional at the same time. We therefore focus on the question of what it is, exactly, that is or could be graded in cases of consciousness, and how we can measure it. Ultimately, four different gradable aspects of consciousness will be described: quality, abstractness, complexity and usefulness, which belong to four different dimensions, these being understood, respectively, as phenomenal, semantic, physiological, and functional. Consequently, consciousness may be said to vary with respect to phenomenal quality, semantic abstraction, physiological complexity, and functional usefulness. It is hoped that such a four-dimensional approach will help to clarify and justify claims about the hierarchical nature of consciousness. The approach also proves explanatorily advantageous, as it enables us not only to draw attention to certain new and important differences in respect of subjective measures of awareness and to justify how a given creature may be ranked higher in one dimension of consciousness and lower in terms of another, but also allows for innovative explanations of a variety of well-known phenomena (amongst these, the interpretations of blindsight and locked-in syndrome will be briefly outlined here).

Despite this burden, the use of prospective trauma registries to describe injury epidemiology and outcomes is limited in low- and middle-income countries. Kenya lacks robust data to describe injury epidemiology and care. The objective of this study was to investigate the epidemiology and outcomes of injuries at 4 referral hospitals in Kenya using hospital -based trauma registries. From January 2014 to May 2015, all injured patients presenting to the casualty departments of Kenyatta National, Thika Level 5, Machakos Level 5, and Meru Level 5 Hospitals were enrolled prospectively. Data collected included demographic characteristics, type of prehospital care received, prehospital time, injury pattern, and outcomes. A total of 14,237 patients were enrolled in our study. Patients were predominantly male (76.1%) and young (mean age 28 years). The most common mechanisms of injury were road traffic injuries (36.8%), falls (26.4%), and being struck/hit by a person or object (20.1%). Burn was the most common mechanism of injury in the age category under 5 years. Body regions commonly injured were lower extremity (35.1%), upper extremity (33.4%), and head (26.0%).

Multiple small nodules were found on the surface of the small and large bowel in addition to an apparent intestinal duplication that seemed to originate posterior to the pancreas. Histopathology of serosal nodules revealed bundles of smooth muscle with associated ganglion cells. Molecular analysis demonstrated the SMO c.1234 C>T mutation in varying amounts in affected skin (up to 35%) and intestinal hamartoma (26%). Gastrointestinal features including structural malformations, motility disorders, and upper GI bleeding are major causes of morbidity in CJS. Smooth muscle hamartomas are a recognized feature of children with CJS typically presenting with abdominal obstruction requiring surgical intervention. A somatic mutation in SMO likely accounts for the structural malformations and predisposition to form bowel hamartomas and myofibromas. The mutation burden in the involved tissues likely accounts for the variable manifestations."}

Sella turcica bridging (STB), or calcification of the interclinoid ligament of sella turcica, has been reported to be associated with some dental anomalies (palatal canine impaction and transposition). The aim of the study was to find any association between canine impaction, hyperdontia or hypodontia and sellar dimensions or bridging. Lateral cephalometric radiographs from 78 patients with impacted canines, 68 with dental agenesis and 17 with hyperdontia were collected. Linear dimensions of sella turcica were calculated and compared to those of a control group (47 individuals). A standardize scoring scale was used to quantify the extent of STB from each radiographs. The frequency of partial and complete calcifications of sella in patients with dental anomalies is increased when compared to controls. STB can influence the interclinoid distance but does not affect other linear dimensions of sella. No statistically significant difference has been found in sellar dimensions and STB expression when evaluating radiographs at different ages. STB is frequently found in patients with dental abnormalities."}

Although the prevalence of C. burnetii in cattle is much higher than in goats and sheep, infected cattle are rarely associated with human outbreaks. We investigated whether the immune response of humans differs after contact with C. burnetii isolates from different host origins or with different multilocus variable number of tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) genotypes. Cytokine responses were measured in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) stimulated with 16 C. burnetii isolates with known MLVA genotype from goats, sheep, cattle, acute and chronic Q fever patients. Coxiella burnetii isolates originating from cattle induce significantly more IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-22 than the isolates from goats, sheep or chronic Q fever patients. Comparing the cytokine induction of the isolates based on their MVLA genotype did not reveal differences in response between the MLVA genotypes. The proinflammatory cytokine response induced in human PBMCs by C. burnetii isolates from cattle may explain the low incidence of human Q fever outbreaks caused by cattle. The cytokine profile of PBMCs stimulated with C. burnetii isolates from chronic Q fever patients resembles isolates from goats. Furthermore, cytokine responses seem to be depending on host origin than on MLVA genotype."}

BAP1 mutations are frequent in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). Our aim was to functionally characterize a newly identified isoform of BAP1 and investigate the effects of its expression on drug sensitivity in MPM. Expression of BAP1 isoforms was detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in MPM and normal mesothelium cell lines and tumor and nontumor samples. Histone H2A ubiquitination levels were analyzed by Western blot after acidic extraction of core histones. Subcellular localization of BAP1 isoforms was examined by immunofluorescence. MPM cell survival in response to poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and dual phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)- mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors was analyzed by in vitro assays. We have identified a novel alternative splice isoform of BAP1 (BAP1\u0394) that misses part of the catalytic domain. Cells transfected with BAP1\u0394 showed reduced deubiquitinating activity compared with full-length BAP1. The expression of BAP1\u0394 transcript is more abundant in nontumor than in tumor samples. MPM cell lines expressing more than 20% of BAP1\u0394 are more sensitive to olaparib (a PARP1 inhibitor) cytotoxicity, and this sensitivity is enhanced when olaparib treatment is combined with GDC0980 (a dual PI3K - mTOR inhibitor), which induces downregulation of BRCA1. These observations suggest that BAP1\u0394 does regulate DNA damage response and influences drug sensitivity. "}

Aortic banding (AB) was performed to induce cardiac hypertrophy. After 1 week of surgery, mice were receive cucurbitacin B treatment (Gavage, 0.2 mg/kg body weight /2 day). After 4 weeks of AB, cucurbitacin B demonstrated a strong anti-hypertrophy and -fibrosis ability as evidenced by decreased of heart weight, myocardial cell cross-sectional area and interstitial fibrosis, ameliorated of systolic and diastolic abnormalities, normalized in gene expression of hypertrophic and fibrotic markers, reserved microvascular density in pressure overload induced hypertrophic mice. Cucurbitacin B also showed significant hypertrophy inhibitory effect in phenylephrine stimulated cardiomyocytes. The Cucurbitacin B -mediated mitigated cardiac hypertrophy was attributable to the increasing level of autophagy, which was associated with the blockade of Akt / mTOR / FoxO3a signal pathway, validated by SC79, MK2206, and 3-MA, the Akt agonist, inhibitor and autophagy inhibitor in vitro. The overexpression of constitutively active Akt completely abolished the Cucurbitacin B -mediated protection of cardiac hypertrophy in human cardiomyocytes AC16. Collectively, our findings suggest that cucurbitacin B protects against cardiac hypertrophy through increasing the autophagy level in cardiomyocytes, which is associated with the inhibition of Akt / mTOR / FoxO3a signal axis.

This was a prospective observational study conducted at a single center, involving children <5 years age, born preterm (GA <30 weeks) or at term (\u226537 weeks' GA). Urinary albumin (mg/L), calcium and phosphate levels indexed to creatinine (mg/dL), and BP were measured. The median (IQR) follow-up age of our cohort (n = 106) was 30 (16-48) months. Preterm-born children (n = 55) had a significantly lower mean GA and birth weight and higher mean systolic, diastolic, and mean BPs, compared with term (n = 51) controls. A significantly higher proportion of preterm-born children weighed <10th centile and had systolic BP >95th centile at follow-up. Albumin and calcium excretion did not differ between the groups; median urine-phosphate creatinine ratios were higher in the preterm group. On logistic regression, lower GA and younger age at follow-up were significantly associated with an increased risk of systolic and diastolic BP above the 95th centile; male gender was associated with decreased risk of diastolic hypertension. Even in early childhood, children born preterm had significantly elevated BP, compared with their term-born counterparts. Closer monitoring of BPs in this population may be warranted."}

Normally, superoxide dismutase (SOD) converts superoxide anions to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and H2O2 is then naturalized to be water by peroxiredoxin 4. We reported previously that recombinant protein transduction domain (PTD)- Cu/Zn SOD effectively scavenged excessive ROS and prevented cardiomyocytes from hypoxia-reoxygenation damage. However, whether PTD - Cu/Zn SOD would prevent BCP development is unknown. In the current study, we found that an implanted carcinoma in the rat tibia induced remarkable hyperalgesia, increased H2O2 levels and decreased SOD and peroxiredoxin 4 levels. After administration of recombinant PTD - Cu/Zn SOD to these tumor-burden rats, their hyperalgesia was significantly attenuated and peroxiredoxin 4 expression was significantly increased. In addition, an increased expression of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors and a decreased expression of \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors in this cancer pain were prevented by PTD - Cu/Zn SOD administration or peroxiredoxin 4 overexpression. Our data suggested that reactive oxygen species, at least in part, play a role in cancer metastatic pain development and persistency which can be attenuated by the adminstration of recombinant PTD - Cu/Zn SOD via the peroxiredoxin 4 modulation from oxidative stress."}

We show here that nitric oxide (NO) generated by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) controls the coalescence of protein kinase C-\u03b8 (PKC-\u03b8) at the central supramolecular activation cluster (c-SMAC) of the IS. eNOS translocated with the Golgi to the IS and partially colocalized with F-actin around the c-SMAC. This resulted in reduced actin polymerization and centripetal retrograde flow of \u03b2-actin and PKC-\u03b8 from the lamellipodium-like distal (d)-SMAC, promoting PKC-\u03b8 activation. Furthermore, eNOS -derived NO S-nitrosylated \u03b2-actin on Cys374 and impaired actin binding to profilin-1 (PFN1), as confirmed with the transnitrosylating agent S-nitroso-L-cysteine (Cys-NO).

Normal potassium range in our laboratory is 3.6-5.2 mmol/L. Hemolyzed samples were not included. The association of potassium levels with the development of supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias was assessed. The incidence of clinically significant arrhythmias was very low (supraventricular tachycardia / atrial fibrillation, 4.9%; nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, 2.9%; sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, 0.1%), confirming the overall safety of DSE. Most arrhythmias (88%) occurred in patients with normal potassium levels, and arrhythmia rates remained low in patients with potassium abnormalities. Patients with hyperkalemia had a lower risk of developing mild (odds ratio [OR], 0.39; 95% CI, 0.22-0.71) and severe (OR, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.01-0.68) supraventricular arrhythmias as well as mild ventricular arrhythmias (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.40-0.83). Even though events were rare, patients with severe hypokalemia (potassium levels \u2264 3.1 mmol/L) had an increased risk of supraventricular arrhythmia and ventricular ectopy.

The geminally dimethylated and catechol -type curcumin analog (compound 3) was identified as a promising lead molecule in terms of its increased stability and cytoprotective activity against the tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP)-induced death of HepG2 cells. Mechanism studies indicate that its cytoprotective effects are mediated by activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway in the Michael acceptor - and catechol -dependent manners. Additionally, we verified by using copper and iron ion chelators that the two metal ion -mediated oxidations of compound 3 to its corresponding electrophilic o-quinone, contribute significantly to its Nrf2 -dependent cytoprotection.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been reported to reduce hepatic IRI because of their reparative immunomodulatory effects in injured tissues. Recent studies have highlighted beneficial effects of extracellular vesicles from MSCs (MSC - EV) on tissue injury. The effects of systemically administered mouse bone marrow derived MSC - EV were evaluated in an experimental murine model of hepatic IRI induced by cross clamping the hepatic artery and portal vein for 90 minutes followed by reperfusion for periods of upto 6 hours. Compared with controls, intravenous administration of MSC - EV 30 minutes prior to IRI dramatically reduced the extent of tissue necrosis, decreased caspase-3 positive and apoptotic cells, and reduced serum aminotransferase levels. MSC - EV increased hepatic mRNA expression of NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 12 (Nlrp12), and the chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1), and reduced mRNA expression of several inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 during IRI. MSC - EV increased cell viability and suppressed both oxidative injury and NF-\u03baB activity in AML12 murine hepatocytes in vitro. In conclusion, the administration of EV derived from bone marrow derived MSCs may ameliorate hepatic IRI by reducing hepatic injury through modulation of the inflammatory response.

To date, however, few effective computational approaches for identifying CAR activators exist. In this study, we aimed to develop three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) models to predict the CAR activating potency of compounds emerging in the drug-discovery process. Models were constructed using comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) based on the molecular alignments of ligands binding to CAR, which were obtained from ensemble ligand-docking using 28 compounds as a training set. The CoMFA model, modified by adding a lipophilic parameter with calculated logD7.4 (S+logD7.4), demonstrated statistically good predictive ability (r(2) = 0.99, q(2) = 0.74).

Human vaginal epithelial cells were transfected with HPV-11 L1 expression vector and siRNA - HPV-11 L1 vectors and a control group was transfected with scrambled siRNA. Cell proliferation in each group was analyzed using the MTT assay and the expression of apoptosis -associated proteins was measured by western blot analysis. Compared with the control group, HPV-11 L1 mRNA and protein levels were significantly increased following transfection with the HPV-11 L1 expression vector in cells (P<0.05), but this result was significantly reversed by silencing of HPV-11 L1 (P<0.05). In addition, cell proliferation in the HPV-11 group was lower than that in the control group; however, cell proliferation was significantly increased in cells transfected with silenced L1 compared with that in the control group (P<0.05). Furthermore, silencing of HPV-11 L1 significantly decreased caspase-3 and caspase-9 expressions in cells, whereas the expression was increased in the HPV-11 L1 group (P<0.05). The present study suggested that siRNA -mediated silencing of HPV-11 L1 may have potential therapeutic applications for treating gynecological diseases associated with HPV-11 infection."}

Endocrine assessment was performed in 100 consecutive cases of acute aneurysmal SAH presenting within 7 days of ictus. The gonadotropic, somatotrophic, thyrotropic, and corticotrophic axes were evaluated for their possible dysfunction. A total of 100 cases (38 males, 62 females; age range - 17-76 years; mean age - 43.6 years) of acute SAH were studied. The aneurysms were located in the anterior circulation (n = 95) and posterior circulation (n = 5). The most common hormone deficiency was of growth hormone (n = 67), followed by gonadotrophin (n = 50), corticotrophin (n = 49) and thyrotrophin (n = 35). Hyperprolactinemia was noted in 10 cases. One-pituitary hormone axis deficiency was noted in 26 cases while 67 cases had two or more pituitary hormone axes dysfunction. A total of 93 cases had hormonal dysfunction in one or more pituitary hormone axes, and seven cases had no hormonal dysfunction. Endocrine dysfunction occurs in 93% cases of acute SAH and multiple pituitary hormone axes dysfunction occurs in 67% cases. It is suggested that hormonal evaluation should be considered as part of management of acute SAH."}

To assess the validity and reliability of a new evaluation method of diaphragmatic motion using fluoroscopy by digital radiography of healthy adults. Twenty-six adults were evaluated, according to the parameters: anthropometry and pulmonary function test. The evaluation of diaphragm mobility by means of fluoroscopy by digital radiography method was randomly conducted by two raters (A and B). The Pearson correlation coefficient and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were used to assess the concurrent validity. The inter-rater and intra-rater reliability of the measurement of diaphragmatic motion was determined using ICC and a confidence interval of 95%. There was a relationship in the assessment of the concurrent validity. There was good inter-rater reliability for right hemidiaphragm mobility and moderate reliability for left hemidiaphragm in the first assessment. In the second assessment, there was good reliability for the mobility of both hemidiaphragms. There was good intra-rater reliability in the mobility of both hemidiaphragms for raters A and B. The evaluation of diaphragmatic motion using fluoroscopy by digital radiography proved to be a valid and reliable method of healthy adults."}

Importantly, AUD typically develops after chronic excessive alcohol use in a subgroup of individuals who drink alcohol, suggesting that AUD results from an interaction between individual vulnerability and prolonged alcohol exposure. The present study assessed the contribution of prolonged exposure to alcohol and individual levels of alcohol intake to the development of loss of control over alcohol seeking in a conditioned suppression model. To investigate the impact of prolonged alcohol exposure, conditioned suppression of alcohol seeking was assessed after 2 and 4 months of intermittent alcohol access (IAA) in a subgroup of rats drinking moderate amounts of alcohol. We observed that suppression of alcohol seeking was reduced after 4 months compared with 2 months of IAA. The influence of individual levels of alcohol intake on loss of control over alcohol seeking was subsequently determined by assessing conditioned suppression in subgroups of low and high alcohol drinking rats. Unlike the low alcohol drinking rats, the high alcohol drinking rats showed aversion-resistant alcohol seeking after 2 months of IAA, although both groups showed comparable levels of conditioned freezing. These findings show that the development of loss of control over alcohol seeking, a key characteristic of AUD in humans, is dependent on both the extent of alcohol exposure and the individual's propensity to consume alcohol."}

A thorough understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying traumatic memories is indispensable for precise diagnosis, for personalized treatment and prevention. In particular, the identification of early neural predictor variables for intrusion development shortly after trauma exposure requires detailed investigation. Here, we examined the neural correlates of early experimental trauma memory retrieval in a traumatic film paradigm in 42 young healthy females, using both implicit and explicit retrieval tasks. We show that implicit experimental trauma retrieval specifically involved the retrosplenial cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), while both retrieval tasks resulted in trauma-related activity in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the precuneus. Importantly, neural activity early after experimental trauma exposure predicted later intrusion development, with independent contributions from activity in the retrosplenial cortex (implicit retrieval) and the PCC (explicit retrieval). Additional analyses revealed a stronger connectivity between the bilateral amygdala and the supplementary motor area, precentral and paracentral lobule for the control group compared to the experimental trauma group. Our study gives new insights in the neural correlates of experimental trauma memory retrieval and their predictive value for subsequent symptom development.

Yet, a linear linkage between amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2) and the disease onset and progression has recently been questioned. In this context, the crucial partnership between A\u03b2 and Nrf2 pathways is acquiring paramount importance, offering prospects for deciphering the A\u03b2 -centered disease network. Here, we report on a new class of antiaggregating agents rationally designed to simultaneously activate transcription -based antioxidant responses, whose lead 1 showed interesting properties in a preliminary investigation. Relying on the requirements of A\u03b2 recognition, we identified the catechol derivative 12. In SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, 12 combined remarkable free radical scavenger properties to the ability to trigger the Nrf2 pathway and induce the Nrf2 - dependent defensive gene NQO1 by means of electrophilic activation of the transcriptional response. Moreover, 12 prevented the formation of cytotoxic stable oligomeric intermediates, being significantly more effective, and per se less toxic, than prototype 1. More importantly, as different chemical features were exploited to regulate Nrf2 and A\u03b2 activities, the two pathways could be tuned independently. These findings point to compound 12 and its derivatives as promising tools for investigating the therapeutic potential of the Nrf2 / A\u03b2 cellular network, laying foundation for generating new drug leads to confront AD."}

CAMHS transitions are often poorly managed with negative outcomes for young people. Better preparation may improve outcomes and experience. This study aimed to co-produce, with young people who had transitioned or were facing transition from CAMHS, a CAMHS Transition Preparation Programme (TPP), deliverable in routine NHS settings. Eighteen young people, aged 17-22, from three UK National Health Service (NHS) mental health foundation trusts participated in creative, participatory research workshops. Seven parents completed short questionnaires. Thirty clinical staff from two trusts took part in workshops to ensure deliverability of young people's ideas. Young people were offered co-research opportunities. Most young people felt anxious, fearful and uncertain on leaving CAMHS and perceived mental health services as uncaring. Participants outlined transition procedures and drafted a range of preparation activities, centred around dedicated Transition Peer Support and a transition booklet, which should be offered to all CAMHS leavers, irrespective of discharge or transfer to an adult service. Preparation should aim to build confidence to help young people take responsibility for themselves and flourish in the adult world: coping or getting through it was not enough. Some clinicians also felt anxious at transition and recognised the potential impact on young people of poor communication and lack of understanding between services. Parents would appreciate help to support their offspring during the transition period. Clinicians cited lack of funding and inflexible NHS procedures and policies as potential barriers to the implementation of young people's ideas. Nine young people took up co-research opportunities. Mental health services underestimate the anxiety of CAMHS leavers. Young people have clear ideas about the preparation they require to leave CAMHS with the confidence to take responsibility for their own health care. Close collaboration of NHS staff and researchers facilitates the implementation of research findings."}

However, the functions of general control nonrepressed-protein 5 (Gcn5), an evolutionarily conserved HAT from yeast to human, in immune regulation remain unappreciated. In this study, we conditionally deleted Gcn5 (encoded by the Kat2a gene) specifically in T lymphocytes by crossing floxed Gcn5 and Lck-Cre mice, and demonstrated that Gcn5 plays important roles in multiple stages of T cell functions including development, clonal expansion, and differentiation. Loss of Gcn5 functions impaired T cell proliferation, IL-2 production, and Th1 / Th17, but not Th2 and regulatory T cell differentiation. Gcn5 is recruited onto the il-2 promoter by interacting with the NFAT in T cells upon TCR stimulation. Interestingly, instead of directly acetylating NFAT, Gcn5 catalyzes histone H3 lysine H9 acetylation to promote IL-2 production. T cell -specific suppression of Gcn5 partially protected mice from myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein - induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an experimental model for human multiple sclerosis. Our study reveals previously unknown physiological functions for Gcn5 and a molecular mechanism underlying these functions in regulating T cell immunity. Hence Gcn5 may be an important new target for autoimmune disease therapy."}

In this paper, we provide a novel strategy for expanding large numbers of super-charged NK cells with significant potential to lyse and differentiate cancer stem cells and demonstrate the differences in the dynamics of NK cell expansion between healthy donors and cancer patients. Decline in cytotoxicity and lower interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 secretion by osteoclast (OC)-expanded NK cells from cancer patients correlates with faster expansion of residual contaminating T cells within purified NK cells, whereas healthy donors ' OCs continue expanding super-charged NK cells while limiting T cell expansion for up to 60 days. Similar to patient NK cells, NK cells from tumor -bearing BLT-humanized mice promote faster expansion of residual T cells resulting in decreased numbers and function of NK cells, whereas NK cells from mice with no tumor continue expanding NK cells and retain their cytotoxicity. In addition, dendritic cells (DCs) in contrast to OCs are found to promote faster expansion of residual T cells within purified NK cells resulting in the decline in NK cell numbers from healthy individuals. Addition of anti-CD3 mAb inhibits T cell proliferation while enhancing NK cell expansion; however, expanding NK cells have lower cytotoxicity but higher secretion of IFN-\u03b3. Expansion and functional activation of super-charged NK cells by OCs is dependent on interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-15. Thus, in this report, we not only provide a novel strategy to expand super-charged NK cells, but also demonstrate that rapid and sustained expansion of residual T cells within the purified NK cells during expansion with DCs or OCs could be a potential mechanism by which the numbers and function of NK cells decline in cancer patients and in BLT-humanized mice."}

Thiol groups have been implicated in redox regulation of these proteins. In our previous study, we proposed that activity of wheat cyclophilin, TaCYPA-1, may be modulated through a novel dual mechanism of redox regulation. To further understand the regulation of PPIase activity of TaCYPA-1, we generated mutants of TaCYPA-1 by substituting cysteine residues at positions -40 and -122 with serine, and at -126 with proline. Comparative analysis of their PPIase activity revealed that catalytic efficiencies (Kcat/Km) of TaCYPA-1C40S (0.37 X 106 M-1 s-1) and TaCYPA-1C122S (0.31 X 106 M-1 s-1) were significantly lower as compared to the native TaCYPA-1 (1.33 X 106 M-1 s-1), whereas Kcat/Km of the double mutant TaCYPA-1C40S/C122S was significantly higher (2.36 X 106 M-1 s-1). Compared to wild-type TaCYPA-1, the different mutants also showed differential sensitivity to Cu2+. Furthermore, the results of this study also revealed that despite lacking PPIase activity, the mutant TaCYPA-1C126P was able to confer partial protection against heat stress. These observations suggest that the mechanism of TaCYPA-1 -induced thermotolerance may also involve other activities besides cis to trans isomerisation, which needs to be identified further."}

A cross-sectional study was performed on 1,001 adolescents (13.2 \u00b1 1.2 years) randomly recruited from schools in southeast Spain. Data on breastfeeding duration were collected via a parental questionnaire. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. C-reactive protein (CRP) was determined by solid-phase chemiluminescent immunometric assay. Nonadjusted and adjusted multivariate correlation analyses confirmed a strong association (p < .001, 95% confidence interval) between the three markers of inflammation and exclusive breastfeeding duration. No significant differences were observed for IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and CRP serum concentrations among normal weight, overweight, and obese adolescents, except for IL-6 between normal weight and obese subjects. Likewise, no significant association was found between these markers of inflammation and body mass index (BMI) z-score. We found a possible association between inflammatory markers and exclusive breastfeeding duration in adolescents, regardless of their BMI. This finding suggests that increased body weight or obesity might not mediate the association between breastfeeding and inflammation. These results contribute to the understanding of the relationship between breastfeeding and inflammatory markers in adolescents."}

Both attenuation and lack of protection are because M.tb DK9897 cannot secrete the EsxA virulence factor nor induce a host response against it. Genome sequencing identified a frameshift mutation in the eccCa1 gene. Since the encoded EccCa1 protein provides energy for ESX-1 secretion, it suggested a defect in the ESX-1 type VII secretion system. Genetic complementation with a plasmid carrying the M.tb H37Rv sequence of eccCa1-eccCb1-pe35 re-established EsxA secretion, host specific EsxA T-cell responses, and increased strain virulence. The ESX-1 secretion defect prevents several virulence factors from being functional during infection and therefore attenuates M.tb. It precludes specific T-cell responses against strong antigens and we found very little in vivo cytokine production, gross pathology or granuloma formation in lungs from M.tb DK9897 infected animals.

Administrators representing 9 of the city's 11 homeless service agencies were interviewed to assess institutional smoking -related policies and cessation programs and perceived barriers and receptivity to instituting tobacco control interventions. Respondents indicated that although most programs had adopted smoke - free grounds and some had eliminated evidence of staff smoking, the smoking status of clients was assessed only when required by funders. None of the programs offered smoking cessation interventions.

Moreover, studies also suggest that ALR2 and PARP-1 co-occur in retinal cells, making them appropriate targets for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy. To find the dual inhibitors of ALR2 and PARP-1, the structure based design was carried out in parallel for both the target proteins. A series of novel thiazolidine-2,4-dione (TZD) derivatives were therefore rationally designed, synthesized and their in vitro inhibitory activities against ALR2 and PARP-1 were evaluated. The experimental results showed that compounds 5b and 5f, with 2-chloro and 4-fluoro substitutions, showed biochemical activities in micromolar and submicromolar range (IC50 1.34-5.03\u03bcM) against both the targeted enzymes. The structure-activity relationship elucidated for these novel inhibitors against both the enzymes provide new insight into the binding mode of the inhibitors to the active sites of enzymes. The positive results of the biochemical assay suggest that these compounds may be further optimized and utilized for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy."}

Study Design Retrospective case series with chart review. Setting Tertiary care children's hospital. Subjects and Methods A total of 201 paired sinus and pulmonary cultures from 105 CF patients were identified between 1996 and 2014. Demographics and culture results were analyzed. Results The mean age of patients was 11.2 \u00b1 5.4 years (range, 1-27 years), and approximately one-half were female. Methicillin - sensitive Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen overall. A significantly higher prevalence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (32% for pulmonary and 37% for sinus cultures) was observed in older patients versus younger patients (P < .001). There was low to moderate agreement between sinus and pulmonary cultures (Kappa statistic range, 0.03-0.56). The prevalence of methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) increased significantly for lower respiratory tract culture (from 5% to 16%) and sinus culture (from 5% to 27%) between 1996-2004 and 2010-2014 (P = .016 and P < .001, respectively). The prevalence of positive sinus cultures increased from 40% to 85% between 1996-2004 and 2010-2014 (P = .018). Patients with pulmonary MRSA were more likely to be coinfected with pulmonary P aeruginosa (risk ratio, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.2-4.8; P = .015) or Aspergillus fumigatus (risk ratio, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.2-4.8; P = .035). Conclusions There is low to moderate correlation between pulmonary and sinus pathogens in CF patients. This is important to consider when treating infections. The prevalence of MRSA in sinus cultures has increased over time and warrants further investigation."}

The invasive nature of GBM complicates surgical resection and restricts chemotherapeutic access, contributing to poor patient prognosis. The migration of tumor cells is closely related to the tumor cell proliferation. The acquisition of migratory capability, in addition to intracellular factors, is proposed to be a crucial mechanism during the progression of invasion. Using qRT-PCR analysis, we determined that the expression of miR-451 in glioma tissue was lower than in control brain tissue, especially in the central portions of the tumor. In glioma cell lines, we found that decreased miR-451 expression suppressed tumor cell proliferation but enhanced migration with a concomitant low level of CAB39 / AMPK / mTOR pathway activation and high level of Rac1 / cofilin pathway activation, respectively. Notably, the effect of miR-451 on cytological behavior and on the activation of mTOR and Rac1 was limited when AMPK\u03b11 expression was knocked-down with a synthetic shRNA. We suggest that the glioma microenvironment results in heterogeneity of miR-451 expression. Our data indicated that miR-451 relays environmental signals by upregulating the activity of AMPK signaling, thereby modulating the activation of mTOR and Rac1 / cofilin which, in turn, play key roles in glioma cell proliferation and migration, respectively. Our results highlight the need to consider opposing roles of a therapeutic target which, while suppressing tumor cell proliferation, could also promote cell infiltration."}

Changes in engine technologies can alter emissions. To quantify these effects, we measured gas- and particle-phase emissions from 82 light-duty gasoline vehicles recruited from the California in-use fleet tested on a chassis dynamometer using the cold-start unified cycle. The fleet included 15 GDI vehicles, including 8 GDIs certified to the most-stringent emissions standard, superultra-low-emission vehicles (SULEV). We quantified the effects of engine technology, emission certification standards, and cold-start on emissions. For vehicles certified to the same emissions standard, there is no statistical difference of regulated gas-phase pollutant emissions between PFIs and GDIs. However, GDIs had, on average, a factor of 2 higher particulate matter (PM) mass emissions than PFIs due to higher elemental carbon (EC) emissions. SULEV certified GDIs have a factor of 2 lower PM mass emissions than GDIs certified as ultralow-emission vehicles (3.0 \u00b1 1.1 versus 6.3 \u00b1 1.1 mg/mi), suggesting improvements in engine design and calibration. Comprehensive organic speciation revealed no statistically significant differences in the composition of the volatile organic compounds emissions between PFI and GDIs, including benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX). Therefore, the secondary organic aerosol and ozone formation potential of the exhaust does not depend on engine technology. Cold-start contributes a larger fraction of the total unified cycle emissions for vehicles meeting more-stringent emission standards. Organic gas emissions were the most sensitive to cold-start compared to the other pollutants tested here. There were no statistically significant differences in the effects of cold-start on GDIs and PFIs. For our test fleet, the measured 14.5% decrease in CO2 emissions from GDIs was much greater than the potential climate forcing associated with higher black carbon emissions. "}

However, its precise role in cancer is controversial, as TRIB3 protein levels have been associated with both good and poor prognosis in cancer patients. Here, we investigated the significance of TRIB3 expression in the survival of gastric cancer cells exposed to anticancer drugs. We found that the tested anticancer drug, doxorubicin, induced cytotoxicity by decreasing TRIB3 transcription, which was followed by apoptotic cell death. Moreover, TRIB3 siRNA knockdown appeared to enhance doxorubicin - induced apoptosis in gastric cancer cells, concurrently with altering the expression of downstream apoptotic factors. Conversely, overexpression of TRIB3 significantly protected cells against doxorubicin - induced apoptosis. Our results indicate that downregulation of TRIB3 appears to promote cell death and enhance doxorubicin - induced apoptosis, supporting the anti-apoptotic role of TRIB3. The inductions of three classes of MAPKs failed to affect doxorubicin -mediated TRIB3 downregulation, while TRIB3 overexpression did not affect doxorubicin - induced MAPK activation. In sum, our findings indicate that TRIB3 plays an anti-apoptotic role in doxorubicin -treated gastric cancer cell lines, perhaps indicating that the status of TRIB3 expression in response to anticancer drugs, such as doxorubicin, irinotecan or oxaliplatin, may reflect the efficiency for cancer therapy."}

Therefore, we now need to identify safe and well tolerated pharmaceutical agents that are able to remodel the microenvironment of solid tumors and enhance chemotherapy. In this study, we repurposed Pirfenidone, a clinically approved anti-fibrotic drug for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, to investigate its possible role on tumor microenvironment normalization. Using two orthotopic mammary tumor models we demonstrate that Pirfenidone reduces collagen and hyaluronan levels and, as a result, significantly increases blood vessel functionality and perfusion and improves the anti-tumor efficacy of doxorubicin. Reduction of extracellular matrix components were mediated via TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway inhibition due to downregulation of TGF\u03b21, COL1A1, COL3A1, HAS2, HAS3 expression levels. Our findings provide evidence that repurposing Pirfenidone could be used as a promising strategy to enhance drug delivery to solid tumors by normalizing the tumor microenvironment."}

The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that TH treatment will ameliorate the complication of HZ. This study investigated the hypothesis by enquiring into a comprehensive medical database at Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) to verify whether patients taking TH medication experience a reduction in HZ occurrence. It was shown by Kaplan-Meier analysis that hypothyroidism patients taking TH medicines had a lower risk of HZ. The fully adjusted analysis indicated that patients receiving medication for the treatment of TH deficiency exhibited a reduced risk of HZ (hazard ratio 0.60, 95% confidence interval 0.51-0.71). This lower risk of HZ was significant in all age groups except the 18-39 years cohort. In addition, female patients taking TH treatment exhibited a lower risk than their male counterparts. Together these findings support the hypothesis that a constant level of TH will provide a degree of protection from contracting HZ.

Yet early developers may experience less peer exclusion if they have social competence, which would bolster their ability to develop and maintain positive relationships with their peers. Accordingly, the present study tests whether pubertal timing and tempo predicts decrements in children's social competence and whether decrements in social competence account for associations between puberty (timing and tempo) and peer exclusion over time. Longitudinal data were drawn from 1364 families (48% female; 76% White; M = 9.32 years, SD = .48, at Wave 3) who participated in Waves 3-5 (i.e., grades 4-6) of Phase III of the NICHD - SECCYD. The results from latent growth curve models indicated that earlier pubertal timing and more rapid pubertal tempo among girls were associated with high initial levels of peer exclusion. Moreover, mediation analyses revealed that early developers' susceptibility to peer exclusion was associated with their initial level of social competence. In boys, pubertal timing and tempo were not directly associated with peer exclusion; instead, indirect effects of pubertal timing on peer exclusion (intercept, slope) occurred through initial levels of social competence. On average, early developers' who had low levels of social competence also had high initial levels of peer exclusion but experienced decrements in peer exclusion over time. The association between the intercepts for puberty and peer exclusion and the slopes for social competence and peer exclusion were stronger for boys than girls. Overall, our findings suggest that early developers' susceptibility to and experiences of peer exclusion are associated with their development of social competence."}

Results reveal the serious air pollution status in Henan province, especially the northern part, and Zhengzhou is the city with the worst air quality. Annual average PM2.5 concentrations exceed the second grade of Chinese Ambient Air Quality Standard (75\u03bcg/m(3)) at both 2014 and 2015. PM2.5 is typically the major pollutant, but ozone pollution can be significant during summer. Furthermore, as the commonly used air quality index (AQI) neglects the mutual health effects from multiple pollutants, we introduced the aggregate air quality index (AAQI) and health-risk based air quality index (HAQI) to evaluate the health risks. Results show that based on HAQI, the current AQI system likely significantly underestimate the health risks of air pollution, highlighting that the general public may need stricter health protection measures.

Our primary aim is to examine PTLD in an adult lung transplant population by utilizing the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Registry. We studied 30,598 adult recipients of lung transplants performed between 1999 and 2011. The primary outcome was development of and time to PTLD. In addition to indication for transplant, other predictors examined included Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) serostatus, gender, and age. Outcomes were assessed with univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models to obtain hazard ratios (HR). 17% of the cohort had a diagnosis of CF. PTLD developed in 2% of CF recipients compared to 1% for non-CF recipients (p<0.001). Compared to non-CF recipients, CF recipients had higher prevalence of EBV and CMV seronegativity and higher prevalences of high risk EBV and CMV mismatch (D+/R-). There is a significant association between CF and the development of PTLD [HR 1.66 (95% CI 1.30-2.12)]. Stratified multivariable analysis controlling for age revealed EBV negative non-CF recipients have an almost 2 fold increased risk of developing PTLD, whereas EBV negative CF recipients had an almost 6.5 fold increased risk.

A total of 15 patients with sepsis, 10 postoperative patients, and 10 healthy volunteers were included in this longitudinal study. Blood was collected at sepsis onset and after surgery respectively, as well as after 24, 72 and 168 h. Levels of cfDNA and exRNA were measured by quantitative probe-based polymerase chain reaction.

Both cfDNA and exRNA were elevated in patients with sepsis compared with postoperative patients and healthy volunteers. While higher exRNA levels correlated with a faster clotting time and more stable clots, cfDNA correlated with a shorter clotting time but also less fibrinolysis.

Assessing and managing future disease risks depends on understanding the causes of contemporary and historical emergence events. Since the mid-1990s, potato growers in the western United States, Mexico, and Central America have experienced severe yield loss from Zebra Chip disease and have responded by increasing insecticide use to suppress populations of the insect vector, the potato psyllid, Bactericera cockerelli (Hemiptera: Triozidae). Despite the severe nature of Zebra Chip outbreaks, the causes of emergence remain unknown. We tested the hypotheses that 1) B. cockerelli occupancy has increased over the last century in California and 2) such increases are related to climate change, specifically warmer winters. We compiled a dataset of 87,000 museum specimen occurrence records across the order Hemiptera collected between 1900 and 2014. We then analyzed changes in B. cockerelli distribution using a hierarchical occupancy model using changes in background species lists to correct for collecting effort. We found evidence that B. cockerelli occupancy has increased over the last century. However, these changes appear to be unrelated to climate changes, at least at the scale of our analysis. To the extent that species occupancy is related to abundance, our analysis provides the first quantitative support for the hypothesis that B. cockerelli population abundance has increased, but further work is needed to link B. cockerelli population dynamics to Zebra Chip epidemics. Finally, we demonstrate how this historical macro-ecological approach provides a general framework for comparative risk assessment of future pest and insect vector outbreaks.

This work describes a longitudinal case study of a patient, whose initials are MMY, with impairments in orthographic lexical processing for reading and spelling at stroke onset, and who recovered these skills within 1 year post stroke. We tested the hypothesis that this acute impairment to reading and spelling would be associated with a selective loss of neural activation in the left fusiform gyrus (FG), and that subsequent recovery would be associated with a gain of neural activation in this region. MMY's case provided a unique opportunity to assess the selectivity of neural changes because she demonstrated a behavioral recovery of naming as well; i.e., if there is neural recovery for reading and spelling, but not naming, then these neural changes are selective to the recovery of orthographic processing. To test our hypothesis, we examined longitudinal behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of reading, spelling, and visual object naming acquired acutely, 3 weeks, 5 months, and one year post stroke. In confirmation of our hypothesis, the loss and subsequent gain of orthographic lexical processing was associated with up-regulation of neural activation in areas previously associated with orthographic lexical processing: i.e., the left mid-FG and inferior frontal junction (IFJ). Furthermore, these neural changes were found to be selective to orthographic processing, as they were observed for reading and spelling, but not for visual object naming within the left mid-FG. This work shows that left PCA stroke can temporarily and selectively disrupt the orthographic lexical processing system, not only in the posterior region adjacent to the stroke, but also in relatively distant frontal orthographic processing regions."}

The LIF genotype frequencies amongst the 73 controls were C/C =45.20%, C/T =50.70% and T/T =4.1%; the C and T allele frequencies were 70% and 30%, respectively. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that SNP 3951C/T of LIF may not be associated with IVF - ET outcome in this population.

Endothelial cells can use a number of different pathways to cause angiogenesis and each step in these pathways can be targeted. The use of multi targeted drugs is gaining much importance in this scenario. Our previous results have shown the anti angiogenic effect of Chebulagic acid - a benzopyran tannin present in the fruits of Terminalia chebula. The present study was designed to examine the molecular mechanism of the anti angiogenic effect of chebulagic acid. Results of our investigations using molecular docking studies and HUVECs in culture suggested that Chebulagic acid inhibited GSK-3\u03b2 dependent \u03b2-catenin phosphorylation, an important mediator of VE-cadherin / \u03b2-catenin signaling and VEGFR2 phosphorylation which is an important step involved in VEGF signaling. Chebulagic acid inhibits angiogenesis by blocking both VEGF / VEGFR2 and cell-cell contact dependent downstream signaling pathway."}

To date, there is no evidence for this indication and the mechanism of such an effect remains poorly understood. In this study, ovariectomized (OVX) mice were used to mimic the estrogen - deficient status of post-menopausal women. Micro-CT and immunohistochemistry was employed to assess the morphological and molecular changes in ovariectomy - induced LFJ arthritis. The results show that the LFJ subchondral bone mass was significantly decreased in OVX mice, with increased cavities on the interface of the subchondral bone. Severe cartilage degradation was observed in ovariectomy - induced LFJ arthritis. Increased blood vessels and innervations were also found in degenerated LFJ, particularly in the subchondral bone area. 17\u03b2-Estradiol treatment efficiently suppressed LFJ subchondral bone turnover, markedly inhibited cartilage degradation, and increased blood vessel and nerve ending growth in degenerated LFJ in OVX mice. Our study reveals that estrogen is a key factor in regulating LFJ metabolism. Severe LFJ degeneration occurs when estrogen is absent in vivo. Collapsed subchondral bone may be the initiation of this process, and estrogen replacement therapy can effectively prevent degeneration of LFJ under estrogen - deficient conditions."}

Cytotoxicity of FTA-loaded nanoparticles along with its efficacy on rat glioma-2 (RG2) cells was also evaluated both in vitro (in comparison with non-malignant cell line, L929) and in vivo. Scanning electron microscopy studies showed that all formulations prepared had smooth surface and spherical in shape. FTA and FTA-loaded nanoparticles have cytotoxic activity against RG2 glioma cell lines in cell culture studies, which further increases with addition of DOTAP. Magnetic resonance imaging and histopathologic evaluation on RG2 tumour cells in rat glioma model (49 female Wistar rats, 250-300 g) comparing intravenous and intratumoral injections of the drug have been performed and FTA-loaded nanoparticles reduced tumour size significantly in in-vivo studies, with higher efficiency of intratumoral administration than intravenous route.

Recommended therapy for acute mesenteric ischemia includes aspiration embolectomy, transcatheter thrombolysis, and angioplasty with or without stenting for the treatment of underlying arterial stenosis. Nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia may respond to transarterial infusion of vasodilators such as nitroglycerin, papaverine, glucagon, and prostaglandin E1. Recommended therapy for chronic mesenteric ischemia includes angioplasty with or without stent placement and, if an endovascular approach is not possible, surgical bypass or endarterectomy. The diagnosis of median arcuate ligament syndrome is controversial, but surgical release may be appropriate depending on the clinical situation. Venous mesenteric ischemia may respond to systemic anticoagulation alone. Transhepatic or transjugular superior mesenteric vein catheterization and thrombolytic infusion can be offered depending on the severity of symptoms, condition of the patient, and response to systemic anticoagulation. Adjunct transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt creation can be considered for outflow improvement. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel.

We recruited 39 young (23-30 years) healthy adults (n = 19 myopes) with best-corrected visual acuity 0.0 LogMAR (20/20) or better in each eye and no binocular or accommodative dysfunction. Monocular and binocular blur discrimination thresholds were measured as a function of pedestal blur using naturalistic stimuli with an adaptive 4AFC procedure. Stimuli were presented in a 46\u00b0 diameter window at 40 cm. Gaussian blur pedestals were confined to an annulus at either 0\u00b0, 4\u00b0, 8\u00b0, or 12\u00b0 eccentricity, with a blur increment applied to only one quadrant of the image. The adaptive procedure efficiently estimated a dipper shaped blur discrimination threshold function with two parameters: intrinsic blur and blur sensitivity. The amount of intrinsic blur increased for retinal eccentricities beyond 4\u00b0 (p < 0.001) and was lower in binocular than monocular conditions (p < 0.001), but was similar across refractive groups (p = 0.47). Blur sensitivity decreased with retinal eccentricity (p < 0.001) and was highest for binocular viewing, but only for central vision (p < 0.05). Myopes showed worse blur sensitivity than emmetropes monocularly (p < 0.05) but not binocularly (p = 0.66). As expected, blur perception worsens in the visual periphery and binocular summation is most evident in central vision. Furthermore, myopes exhibit a monocular impairment in blur sensitivity that improves under binocular conditions. Implications for the development of myopia are discussed."}

Therefore, we investigated factors associated with ND in patients with LAA. We studied patients with LAA who were admitted to our hospital. We divided them into 2 groups with (group 1) and without deterioration (group 2), and evaluated their medical records, risk factors, and radiological findings, such as number of diffusion - positive lesion and degree of stenosis. Our study population consisted of 171 patients; 71 (41.5%) did and 100 (58.5%) did not suffer deterioration.

By multivariate analysis, systolic BP (\u2265170 mm Hg, odds ratio: 7.20, P <.001) was associated with ND. Furthermore, number of diffusion-weighted image (DWI)- positive lesion (\u22658), degree of stenosis (>80.0%), and NIHSS score (\u22654) were also independent factors associated with ND.

Only three variables are necessary to derive the cumulative load associated with a lifting task: the weight of the load, the maximum horizontal distance from the spine to the load, and the number of repetitions for tasks performed during the workday. The new tool was validated using two existing epidemiological databases: the Lumbar Motion Monitor (LMM) database, and a database from a U.S. automotive manufacturer. The LiFFT cumulative damage metric explained 92% of the deviance in low back disorders (LBDs) in the LMM database and 72-95% of the deviance in low back outcomes in the automotive database (depending on the outcome measure). Thus, LiFFT is practitioner friendly and its cumulative damage metric highly related to low back outcomes."}

Thirteen ISSR primers amplified 96 bands, of which 91 (93.65%) were polymorphic, whereas 20 SSR primers amplified 73 bands, of which 70 (96.50%) were polymorphic. Nei's gene diversity (h = 0.28), Shannon's information index (I = 0.43), and polymorphism information content (PIC = 0.29) generated using the SSR primers were higher than that with ISSR primers (h = 0.23, I = 0.37, PIC = 0.24), thereby suggesting that the SSR system is more efficient than the ISSR system in assessing genetic diversity in various pineapple accessions. Mean genetic similarities were 0.74, 0.61, and 0.69, as determined using ISSR, SSR, and combined ISSR / SSR, respectively. These results suggest that the genetic diversity among pineapple accessions is very high.

Five hundred and twenty-five patients with AVF creation were stratified based on age <65, 65-75, and >75 years. AVF outcomes including primary failure, AVF patency (primary, secondary, and functional), and AVF complications were studied for 3 years following AVF creation. The cohort was 63% male, 44% Caucasian, and 55% had diabetes or cardiovascular disease. 39% were aged <65 years, 33% 65-75 years, and 28% were aged >75 years. No differences in rates of primary failure, loss of primary patency, complications, or need for intervention were observed between age groups. There was a significant association of age with secondary patency and functional patency, with age >75 being an independent risk factor for shortened lifespan of the fistula. For patients aged >75 years, secondary patency at 3 years was 64% compared to 75%-78% for younger patients. Functional patency at 2 years was 69% for those aged >75 years compared to 78%-81% for younger patients. We found no difference in AVF maturation, primary patency, complications, or interventions in those over the age of 75 compared to younger counterparts. While secondary and functional patency rates were significantly lower in those aged >75 years, the magnitude of difference is likely not clinically relevant.

Sequencing efforts often uncover novel genetic content; this is most evident for phage communities, in which upwards of 90% of all sequences exhibit no similarity to any sequence in current data repositories. For the small fraction that can be identified, the top BLAST hit is generally posited as being representative of a viral taxon present in the sample of origin. Homology -based classification, however, can be misleading as sequence repositories capture but a small fraction of phage diversity. Furthermore, lateral gene transfer is pervasive within phage communities. As such, the presence of a particular gene may not be indicative of the presence of a particular viral species. Rather, it is just that: an indication of the presence of a specific gene. To circumvent this limitation, we have developed a new method for the analysis of viral metagenomic datasets. BLAST hits are weighted, integrating the sequence identity and length of alignments as well as a taxonomic signal, such that each gene is evaluated with respect to its information content. Through this quantifiable metric, predictions of viral community structure can be made with confidence. As a proof-of-concept, the approach presented here was implemented and applied to seven freshwater viral metagenomes. While providing a robust method for evaluating viral metagenomic data, the tool is versatile and can easily be customized to investigations of any environment or biome."}

Citrinin is generally formed after harvest and occurs mainly in stored grains, it also occurs in other plant products. Often, the co-occurrence with other mycotoxins is observed, especially ochratoxin A, which is usually associated with endemic nephropathy. At the European Union level, systematic monitoring of Citrinin in grains began with the aim of determining its highest permissible amount in food. Thus, far the systematic monitoring of the above mentioned mycotoxin in Croatia is yet to begin.

We present the case of an adult man with a fusiform aneurysm of the right posterior cerebral artery at the P2-P3 junction. He clinically failed a balloon test occlusion preoperatively and therefore underwent an occipital artery to distal posterior cerebral artery bypass with subsequent endovascular occlusion of the parent vessel and aneurysm. Despite the fact that the immediate and 6 month follow up cerebral angiography confirmed a patent bypass, the patient still developed a posterior cerebral artery territory stroke.

Effects of Different Scoring Procedures across Multiple Attempts When Testing a Motor Skill Task Tests or test batteries used for assessing motor skills, either in research studies or in clinical settings, apply a variety of procedures for scoring performances, including everything from one to ten attempts, of which the best is scored or an average is computed. The rationale behind scoring procedures is rarely stated, and it seems that the number of attempts allowed is decided without much qualification from research. It is uncertain whether procedures fairly capture an individual's skill level. Thus, the validity of the tests may be compromised. The present study tested 24 young female soccer players on the juggling of a soccer ball. They were given 10 attempts, and trials were scored according to nine different procedures including the ' best of ' or ' mean of ' either one, two, three, five, or ten attempts. Individual raw scores differed widely across trials, but no general effect of trials was found. The mean (SD) percentage difference between the lowest and highest scores was 27.7(9.9)%, with 17 players (71%) demonstrating a significant change from lowest to highest score. Correlations between raw scores were low across trials, while they were generally higher across scoring procedures. The first trial was significantly different from the remaining both as a raw score and as scoring procedure. The mean percentage difference between best-of-two and best-of-ten scores was 95%, with 50 % of the players demonstrating a significant difference between the two scoring procedures. No significant differences were found across mean-of-rule scorings. Best-of-rule and mean-of-rule scorings were significantly different except for the best-of-two vs. mean-of-two. The mean difference between highest and lowest rank across players was 6.7 (3.6), with individual rankings within the group varying 33% on average across procedures. One player moved from 3rd to 23rd place because of procedural differences. Therefore, it is concluded that scoring procedures affect results and may have an impact on test outcomes. This may present consequences for decision-making from test results, such as diagnosing and selection of intervention groups. We hope that our results would inspire further research into the scoring procedures of the vast amount of tests and tasks in common use."}

Dynamic causal modeling results further demonstrate how the anterior STS interacts with the associative memory system to facilitate successful memory formation for AV face - name associations. Specifically, the connection of fusiform gyrus to anterior STS is enhanced while the reverse connection is reduced when participants subsequently remembered both face and name.

The hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) for CVD was 2.08 (1.28-3.9) for the 98th percentile of QT interval by heart rate ranges, 2.05 (1.27-3.33) for QTc Bazett, 1.39 (0.44-4.34) for QTc Fridericia, 1.05 (0.26-4.24) for QTc Hodges, and 1.12 (0.28-4.52) for QTc Framingham. The hazard ratio of QTc Bazett was significantly higher than the other formulas except for the 98th percentile method. The Framingham, Hodges, and Fridericia equations remove the effect of heart rate on QT interval significantly better than the Bazett equation. Using QT-interval percentiles based on heart rate provides a consistent approach both for identifying those whose QT intervals prolong due to drugs or other stressors and for assessing CVD risk."}

Self-Regulated Learning Strategies and Achievement in Introductory Biology In college introductory science courses, students are challenged with mastering large amounts of disciplinary content while developing as autonomous and effective learners. Self-regulated learning (SRL) is the process of setting learning goals, monitoring progress toward them, and applying appropriate study strategies. SRL characterizes successful, \"expert\" learners, and develops with time and practice. In a large, undergraduate introductory biology course, we investigated: 1) what SRL strategies students reported using the most when studying for exams, 2) which strategies were associated with higher achievement and with grade improvement on exams, and 3) what study approaches students proposed to use for future exams. Higher - achieving students, and students whose exam grades improved in the first half of the semester, reported using specific cognitive and metacognitive strategies significantly more frequently than their lower - achieving peers. Lower - achieving students more frequently reported that they did not implement their planned strategies or, if they did, still did not improve their outcomes. These results suggest that many students entering introductory biology have limited knowledge of SRL strategies and/or limited ability to implement them, which can impact their achievement. Course -specific interventions that promote SRL development should be considered as integral pedagogical tools, aimed at fostering development of students ' lifelong learning skills."}

This introduces an additional source of uncertainty beyond model and measurement error - uncertainty stemming from relying on inexact inference rules. Here we identify and analyse heuristics used to prioritise risk objects, to discriminate between signal and noise, to weight evidence, to construct models, to extrapolate beyond datasets, and to make policy. Some of these heuristics are based on causal generalisations, yet can misfire when these relationships are presumed rather than tested (e.g. surrogates in clinical trials). Others are conventions designed to confer stability to decision analysis, yet which may introduce serious error when applied ritualistically (e.g. significance testing). Some heuristics can be traced back to formal justifications, but only subject to strong assumptions that are often violated in practical applications. Heuristic decision rules (e.g. feasibility rules) in principle act as surrogates for utility maximisation or distributional concerns, yet in practice may neglect costs and benefits, be based on arbitrary thresholds, and be prone to gaming. We highlight the problem of rule-entrenchment, where analytical choices that are in principle contestable are arbitrarily fixed in practice, masking uncertainty and potentially introducing bias. Strategies for making risk and decision analysis more rigorous include: formalising the assumptions and scope conditions under which heuristics should be applied; testing rather than presuming their underlying empirical or theoretical justifications; using sensitivity analysis, simulations, multiple bias analysis, and deductive systems of inference (e.g. directed acyclic graphs) to characterise rule uncertainty and refine heuristics; adopting \" recovery schemes \" to correct for known biases; and basing decision rules on clearly articulated values and evidence, rather than convention."}

In the present study, a MyD88 gene was identified and characterized from a commercially important shellfish, Scapharca subcrenata, including a DEATH domain and TIR domain conserved within other molluscs. Furthermore, comparative genomic evidence revealed that MyD88 was of different lengths and contained quantitative exon and intron regions, which might be involved in specific mechanisms. To further explore the phylogenetic relationships of invertebrate metazoan MyD88, we applied MrBayes and PhyML software to construct phylogenetic trees using Bayesian and maximum likelihood approaches, respectively, which suggested that the MyD88 of Arthropoda was closely related to lower invertebrates, in contrast to morphological taxonomy. Finally, we investigated the evolutionary patterns and location of positive selection sites (PSSs) in the MyD88 gene from Arthropoda, Mollusca and Insecta using PAML software with the maximum likelihood method. The data showed that positive selection sites were detected in these groups, and partial sites were located in the TIR domain but were not found in the DEATH domain. To summarize, in this study, we report on the diversification of MyD88 in invertebrate metazoans, the specific evolutionary position of Arthropoda MyD88, and the positive selection pressures on MyD88 of Arthropoda, Mollusca and Insecta. These results are a valuable contribution to understand and clarify the evolutionary pattern of TLR / MyD88 signalling pathways in invertebrate and vertebrate taxa."}

To summarise the cognitive clinico- radiological paradox and explore the potential methodological factors that could influence the assessment of this relationship. Systematic review and meta-analysis of primary research relating cognitive function to white matter lesion burden. Fifty papers met eligibility criteria for review, and meta-analysis of overall results was possible in thirty-two (2050 participants). Aggregate correlation between cognition and T2 lesion burden was r = -0.30 (95% confidence interval: -0.34, -0.26). Wide methodological variability was seen, particularly related to key factors in the cognitive data capture and image analysis techniques. Resolving the persistent clinico- radiological paradox will likely require simultaneous evaluation of multiple components of the complex pathology using optimum measurement techniques for both cognitive and MRI feature quantification.

Their critical roles in different biological pathways have been already well established. Altered expression of lncRNAs can be involved in the cancer initiation and/or progression. Since patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are usually diagnosed in late stages, developing diagnostic methods seems to be essential. In this study, the expression levels of different lncRNAs were systematically analysed in different genomic and transcriptome datasets. The analyses showed that SNHG6 is among the lncRNAs with distinctive dysregulation of expression and copy number variation in HCC tumors compared with normal tissues. The results also suggest that the dysregulation of SNHG6 is highly cancer type specific. Through co-occurrence analyses, we found that SNHG6 and its related co-expressed genes on 8q are involved in the structural integrity of ribosome and translation.

To address these two general questions, we subjected larvae of a pair of sister species differed mainly in host range, the generalist Helicoverpa armigera and its specialist counterpart Helicoverpa assulta, to the same sets of stage, protein to digestible carbohydrate (P:C) ratio, allelochemical or host plant treatments for simultaneous analyses of GOX transcripts and activities in their labial glands. GOX activity and transcripts are upregulated concurrently with food ingestion and body growth, downregulated with stopping ingestion and wandering for pupation in both species. The three tested host plants upregulated GOX transcripts, and to a lesser extent, GOX activity in both species. There were significant differences in both GOX transcripts and activity elicited by allelochemicals, but only in GOX transcripts by P:C ratios in both species. GOX activities were higher in H. armigera than H. assulta in all the comparable treatments, but GOX transcripts were significantly higher either in generalists or in specialists, depending on the developmental stages, host plants, P:C ratio and allelochemicals they encounter. These data indicate that the greater GOX activity in generalist herbivores is not achieved by greater transcription rate, but by greater transcript stability, greater translation rate, better enzyme stability and/or their combination."}

Propranolol was shown to reduce CO2 production in an experimental DISSUB model in humans but its effects on DCS in a DISSUB rescue scenario are unknown. A 100% oxygen prebreathe (OPB) reduces DCS incidence and severity and is incorporated into some DISSUB rescue protocols. We used a swine model of DISSUB rescue to study the effect of propranolol on DCS incidence and mortality with and without an OPB. In Experiment 1, male Yorkshire Swine (70 kg) were pressurized to 2.8 ATA for 22 h. Propranolol 1.0 mg \u00b7 kg-1 (IV) was administered at 21.25 h. At 22 h, the animal was rapidly decompressed and observed for DCS type, onset time, and mortality.

One major benefit that the gut microbiota provides to its host is colonization resistance -the ability to prevent colonization by foreign microbes, including diarrheal pathogens such as Clostridium difficile, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and diarrheagenic Escherichia coli. We conducted a literature review of the effects of the gut microbiota on infection by diarrheal pathogens. We used PubMed to search for relevant articles published before July 2016, as well as incorporated data from our laboratory. The gut microbiota provides protection from diarrheal infections both by direct inhibition of pathogens and by indirect effects on host functions. Direct effects of the microbiota on diarrheal pathogens include competing for nutrients and producing metabolites that inhibit pathogen growth or virulence. Indirect effects of the gut microbiota include promoting maintenance of the gut mucosal barrier and stimulating innate and adaptive immunity. Human epidemiological studies and experimental infections of laboratory animals both demonstrate that antibiotic treatment can alter the gut microbial community and thereby reduce colonization resistance against diarrheal pathogens. Further research might lead to the development of next-generation probiotics that could be used to bolster colonization resistance and thus prevent travellers' diarrheal."}

Using a monocentric prospectively maintained database, we included 3062 patients who underwent minimally invasive RP between 2006 and 2013. We explored clinicopathologic features and outcomes associated with a GG upgrade from biopsy to RP. Multivariate logistic regression was used to develop and validate a nomogram to predict upgrading for GG1. Biopsy GG was upgraded after RP in 51.5% of cases. Patients upgraded from GG1 to GG2 or GG3 after RP had a longer time to biochemical recurrence than those with GG2 or GG3 respectively, on both biopsy and RP, but a shorter time to biochemical recurrence than those who remained GG1 after RP (P < .0001). In multivariate analyses, variables predicting upgrading for GG1 PCa were age (P = .0014), abnormal digital rectal examination (P < .0001), prostate -specific antigen density (P < .0001), percentage of positive cores (P < .0001), and body mass index (P = .037). A nomogram was generated and validated internally. Biopsy grading system is misleading in approximately 50% of cases. Upgrading GG from biopsy to RP may have consequences on clinical outcomes.

To address this issue, we recorded high - density ECoG signals from patients undergoing epilepsy surgery evaluation as they performed elementary upper extremity movements while systematically varying movement speed and duration. Specifically, subjects performed intermittent pincer grasp / release, elbow flexion / extension, and shoulder flexion / extension at slow, moderate, and fast speeds. In all movements, bursts of power in the high -[Formula: see text] band (80-160 Hz) were observed in M1. In addition, the amplitude of these power bursts and the area of M1 with elevated high -[Formula: see text] activity were directly proportional to the movement speed. Likewise, the duration of elevated high -[Formula: see text] activity increased with movement duration. Based on linear regression, M1 high -[Formula: see text] power amplitude and duration covaried with movement speed and duration, respectively, with an average [Formula: see text] of [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]. These findings indicate that the encoding of upper extremity movement speed by M1 high -[Formula: see text] activity is primarily linear. Also, the fact that this activity remained elevated throughout a movement suggests that M1 does not merely generate transient instructions for a specific movement duration, but instead is responsible for the entirety of the movement.

Adult male, intact female and, ovariectomized (OVX) female mice exposed to CVMS displayed despair behavior, a depression -like phenotype, in all the groups. However, intact females alone, but not males and OVX females, showed anhedonia, another depression -like phenotype.

The reluctance to study visual confidence may have come in part from obtaining convincing experimental evidence in favor of metacognitive abilities rather than just perceptual sensitivity. Some effort has thus been dedicated to offer different experimental paradigms to study visual confidence in humans and nonhuman animals. To understand the origins of confidence judgments, investigators have developed two competing frameworks. The approach based on signal decision theory is popular but fails to account for response times. In contrast, the approach based on accumulation of evidence models naturally includes the dynamics of perceptual decisions. These models can explain a range of results, including the apparently paradoxical dissociation between performance and confidence that is sometimes observed."}

However, despite this achievement, it has not been matched with improvements in the quality of education and health; investment in both sectors is among the lowest in the region. This situation perpetuates huge gaps in infrastructure and also conditions a poor literacy level of the population specifically in health. Currently, there is a fragmented model of patient care, in which the systems are exclusive of each other. They do not cooperate or communicate with each other; and if there is no vertical communication within the system, preventing referral of patients directly from the basic level to the complex level of care when needed. In addition, there has been no progress in the development of an empathetic, respectful or person-centered clinical practice; instead, economic, social and educational differences perpetuate a paternalistic clinical practice. The task of orienting medical training towards the development of humanism is pending. The patient is the center of the medical act and the main objective of doctors' actions. A humanistic care approach will not only empower the person in the clinical encounter - to participate and make decisions related to his/her health care - but it will allow us to move towards an empathetic, caring, respectful and kind model of clinical practice."}

In contrast to quiescent hepatic stellate cells (qHSCs), a specific marker for quiescent PSCs (qPSCs) that can be used in formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) normal human pancreatic tissue has not been identified. The aim of this study was to identify a marker enabling the identification of qPSCs in normal human FFPE pancreatic tissue. Immunohistochemical (IHC), double-IHC, immunofluorescence (IF) and double-IF analyses were carried out using a tissue microarray consisting of cores with normal human pancreatic tissue. Cores with normal human liver served as control. Antibodies directed against adipophilin, \u03b1-SMA, CD146, CRBP-1, cytoglobin, desmin, GFAP, nestin, S100A4 and vinculin were examined, with special emphasis on their expression in periacinar cells in the normal human pancreas and perisinusoidal cells in the normal human liver. The immunolabelling capacity was evaluated according to a semiquantitative scoring system. Double-IF of the markers of interest together with markers for other periacinar cells was performed. Moreover, the utility of histochemical stains for the identification of human qPSCs was examined, and their ultrastructure was revisited by electron microscopy. Adipophilin, CRBP-1, cytoglobin and vinculin were expressed in qHSCs in the liver, whereas cytoglobin and adipophilin were expressed in qPSCs in the pancreas. Adipophilin immunohistochemistry was highly dependent on the preanalytical time interval (PATI) from removal of the tissue to formalin fixation. Cytoglobin, S100A4 and vinculin were expressed in periacinar fibroblasts (FBs). "}

However, the use of adipophilin as a qPSC marker may be limited due to its high dependence on optimal PATI. Cytoglobin, on the other hand, is a sensitive marker for qPSCs but is expressed in FBs as well."}

Particulate matter (PM) in atmospheric pollution contains readily- measurable concentrations of magnetic minerals. Biological surfaces, exposed to atmospheric pollution, accumulate magnetic particles over time, providing a record of location - specific, time-integrated air quality information. This review summarizes current knowledge of biological material (' sensors ') used for biomagnetic monitoring purposes. Our work addresses: the range of magnetic properties reported for lichens, mosses, leaves, bark, trunk wood, insects, crustaceans, mammal and human tissues; their associations with atmospheric pollutant species (PM, NOx, trace elements, PAHs); the pros and cons of biomagnetic monitoring of atmospheric pollution; current challenges for large-scale implementation of biomagnetic monitoring; and future perspectives. A summary table is presented, with the aim of aiding researchers and policy makers in selecting the most suitable biological sensor for their intended biomagnetic monitoring purpose."}

The differences correspond to the distribution and structure of lipids, proteins, nucleic acids as well as other metabolites. These differences depended on the type and the grade of cancer. The sensitivity of chemotherapy drugs on individual specific was also discussed. Here, we emphasize that FTIR spectroscopy and imaging can be considered as a promising technique and will find its place on the detection of this dreadful disease because of high sensitivity, accuracy and inexpensive technique. Now the medical community started using and accepting this technique for early stage cancer detection. But, this technique endures several challenges on its application into the diagnosis of cancer in regards of sample preparations, data interpretation, and data analysis. In general, more research is needed in this field and it is necessary to understand the morphology and biology of the sample before using the spectroscopy and imaging because invaluable information to be figured out."}

To gain insight to the role of CLASP2 in this system, we developed and successfully executed a streamlined interactome approach and built a CLASP2 protein network in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Using two different commercially available antibodies for CLASP2 and an antibody for epitope -tagged, overexpressed CLASP2, we performed multiple affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry (AP - MS) experiments in combination with label-free quantitative proteomics and analyzed the data with the bioinformatics tool Significance Analysis of Interactome (SAINT). We discovered that CLASP2 co-immunoprecipitates (co-IPs) the novel protein SOGA1, the microtubule-associated protein kinase MARK2, and the microtubule / actin - regulating protein G2L1. The GTPase-activating proteins AGAP1 and AGAP3 were also enriched in the CLASP2 interactome, although subsequent AGAP3 and CLIP2 interactome analysis suggests a preference of AGAP3 for CLIP2. Follow-up MARK2 interactome analysis confirmed reciprocal co-IP of CLASP2 and also revealed MARK2 can co-IP SOGA1, glycogen synthase, and glycogenin. Investigating the SOGA1 interactome confirmed SOGA1 can reciprocal co-IP both CLASP2 and MARK2 as well as glycogen synthase and glycogenin. SOGA1 was confirmed to colocalize with CLASP2 and also with tubulin, which identifies SOGA1 as a new microtubule-associated protein. "}
