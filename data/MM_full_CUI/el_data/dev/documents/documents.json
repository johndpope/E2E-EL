Research indicates the negative impact of wartime deployment on the well being of service members, military spouses, and children. Yet, few studies have considered how parental deployments may affect adjustment in young children and their families. Using deployment records and parent - reported measures from primary caregiving (N = 680) and military (n = 310) parents, we examined the influence of deployment on adjustment in military families with children ages 0-10 years. Greater deployment exposure was related to impaired family functioning and marital instability. Parental depressive and posttraumatic stress symptoms were associated with impairments in social emotional adjustment in young children, increased anxiety in early childhood, and adjustment problems in school-age children. Conversely, parental sensitivity was associated with improved social and emotional outcomes across childhood. These findings provide guidance to developing preventive approaches for military families with young children."}

Pollination of flowers with long corolla tubes by long-tongued hawkmoths has been invoked as a showcase model of co-evolution. Recently, optimal foraging models have predicted that there might be a close association between mouthparts' length and the corolla depth of the visited flowers, thus favouring trait convergence and specialization at community level. Here, we assessed whether hawkmoths more frequently pollinate plants with floral tube lengths similar to their proboscis lengths (morphological match hypothesis) against abundance -based processes (neutral hypothesis) and ecological trait mismatches constraints (forbidden links hypothesis), and how these processes structure hawkmoth - plant mutualistic networks from five communities in four biogeographical regions of South America. We found convergence in morphological traits across the five communities and that the distribution of morphological differences between hawkmoths and plants is consistent with expectations under the morphological match hypothesis in three of the five communities. In the two remaining communities, which are ecotones between two distinct biogeographical areas, interactions are better predicted by the neutral hypothesis. Our findings are consistent with the idea that diffuse co-evolution drives the evolution of extremely long proboscises and flower tubes, and highlight the importance of morphological traits, beyond the forbidden links hypothesis, in structuring interactions between mutualistic partners, revealing that the role of niche-based processes can be much more complex than previously known."}

An evaluation is also made of the renal failure rate and related economic outcomes between study groups. An economic post hoc evaluation of a randomized, double-blind, multicenter phase 4 study was carried out. Nosocomial pneumonia due to MRSA in hospitalized adults. The modified intent to treat (mITT) population comprised 224 linezolid - and 224 vancomycin - treated patients. Costs and HCRU were evaluated between patients administered either linezolid or vancomycin, and between patients who developed renal failure and those who did not. Analysis of HCRU outcomes and costs. Total costs were similar between the linezolid - (\u20ac17,782\u00b1\u20ac9,615) and vancomycin - treated patients (\u20ac17,423\u00b1\u20ac9,460) (P=.69). The renal failure rate was significantly lower in the linezolid - treated patients (4% vs. 15%; P<.001). The total costs tended to be higher in patients who developed renal failure (\u20ac19,626\u00b1\u20ac10,840 vs. \u20ac17,388\u00b1\u20ac9,369; P=.14).

Approximately 10-20% of patients with keratoconus eventually require a corneal transplant. Corneal cross-linking (CXL) is a relatively new treatment that may help prevent the need for corneal transplantation. Here, we investigated whether the introduction of CXL has reduced the number of corneal transplants performed annually. Data regarding the transplantation procedures performed in patients under the age of 50 years were extracted from the Dutch National Organ Transplant Registry. The number of corneal transplants performed prior to (i.e. in 2005 through 2007) and following the introduction of CXL (i.e. in 2012 through 2014) were compared. Furthermore, a trend analysis on annual keratoplasties over time was performed. Approximately 25% fewer corneal transplants were performed in the 3- year period following the introduction of CXL compared to the 3- year period prior to the introduction of CXL (201 versus 269 transplants, respectively; p = 0.005). Age, gender and visual acuity were similar between the patient groups in the two time periods. Trend analysis also demonstrated a significant decrease in the amount of corneal transplants (p = 0.001). Significantly fewer corneal transplants were performed for treating keratoconus following the nationwide introduction of CXL. This reduction suggests that corneal cross-linking can significantly reduce the need for corneal transplantation."}

Our aims were (1) to determine the pattern of metabolic adjustments following a rapid temperature change, (2) to determine whether performance varies at similar rates during exposure to warm or cold environments, and (3) to determine if BMR, Msum and MMR change at comparable rates during thermal acclimation. We measured these parameters in white-throated sparrows (Zonotrichia albicollis), black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus), and snow buntings (Plectrophenax nivalis) after acclimation to 10 \u00b0C (day 0) and on the 4th and 8th days of acclimation to either -5 or 28 \u00b0C. Birds changed their metabolic phenotype within 8 days with patterns differing among species. Sparrows expressed the expected metabolic increases in the cold and decreases at thermoneutrality while performance in chickadees and buntings was not influenced by temperature but changed over time with inverse patterns. Our results suggest that BMR varies at comparable rates in warm and cold environments but changes faster than Msum and MMR, likely due to limitations in the rate of change in organ size and function. They also suggest that maximal metabolic capacity is lost faster in a warm environment than it is gained in a cold environment. With the expected increase in temperature stochasticity at northern latitudes, a loss of thermogenic capacity during warm winter days could, therefore, be detrimental if birds are slow to readjust their phenotype with the return of cold days."}

Priming has been shown to have effects on individual behavior in a variety of contexts by influencing subconscious cognition. This paper investigates the effects of semantic priming using healthy body image, goal-oriented words on food consumption. The moderating role of both restrained eating and gender is investigated. 161 participants were involved in an experiment using a novel version of a scrambled sentence priming game. The outcome measure was the number of kilocalories consumed, examined using a between subjects ANCOVA with priming, gender, restrained eating index, self-reported BMI, and two interaction terms (priming x gender, and priming x restrained eating index). There was no main effect of priming but there was an interaction of priming with gender. Females consumed significantly fewer kilocalories after being exposed to priming words related to a healthy body image (i.e. \"slim\", \"fit,\") compared to females receiving the neutral prime, with a medium effect size (d = 0.58). The body image prime did not significantly affect food intake for males, nor did it have a differential effect on restrained eaters. This study shows that priming can be an effective method for influencing females to reduce food intake, regardless of whether they are restrained or unrestrained eaters. Future studies could investigate whether different priming words related to a male's healthy body image goal (i.e. \"buff,\" \" muscles ,\" etc.) would similarly reduce food intake for males."}

Neurotrophins (NTs) are mainly involved in the development and maintenance of neuronal populations in the central and peripheral nervous system, but also in reproductive system. In this survey, we first studied the morphological organization of the quail oviduct, distinguished in infundibulum, magnum, isthmus, uterus and vagina, and then we analyzed the expression and localization of NTs and Trks receptors in the whole tracts. By western blotting we detected that the investigated NTs and Trks receptors are expressed in all oviductal tracts. By immunohistochemistry we were able to define the distribution of NTs and Trks. Specifically, NGF, BDNF and NT3 were localized in lining and ductal epithelial cells, and NGF was also detected in secretory cells of tubular glands and in nervous fibers of vessel wall. TrkA and TrkB were present in the lining and ductal epithelium; TrkA and TrkC were present in nervous fibers of vessel wall in all oviductal tracts. Furthermore, we also observed NGF and BDNF co-localized with TrkA and TrkB in cells of the lining and ductal epithelium, suggesting an autocrine mechanism of action."}

Thirty fila from patients with TCS, including 5 where minimal cautery was used prior to filum section, were compared with fila from 27 pediatric cadavers without TCS (controls). Sections of fila were stained with H&E, Masson trichrome and Verhoeff von Gieson elastic stains, and 7 with Gordon and Sweet's reticulin stain. Fila from controls showed loose fibrous connective tissue (FCT) with thin and evenly dispersed elastic fibers (EFs). Reticulin fibers (RFs) were seen in blood vessel walls and nerve twigs. Fat was identified microscopically in 2 fila. All fila from patients with TCS had dense FCT. The EFs were in normal numbers in 17, and focally or diffusely decreased in 13. All 25 patients where the fila were cauterized during resection had thick and coiled EFs. Coiling was not seen when minimal cautery was applied. RFs were seen in blood vessel walls and nerve twigs. Fat was identified in 19 patients. Findings were similar, whether the conus termination was normal or low. The fila of all patients with TCS, whether or not the conus was low, showed abnormal FCT. EFs were decreased in 48 % of patients; however, there were thick and coiled EFs in all patients. Coiling of EFs, initially thought to be an abnormality in patients, is considered most likely to be a result of cautery (i.e., artifactual / iatrogenic coiling)."}

The aim of this study was to determine whether histologic evaluation of non-neoplastic kidney could enable early identification of unrecognized kidney disease and could be of prognostic value in predicting postoperative renal outcomes. We retrospectively analyzed 51 patients with upper urinary tract malignancies who received uninephrectomy or uninephroureterectomy. A thorough pathologic evaluation of non-neoplastic kidney including special stains, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopic studies was performed. The degree of parenchymal changes was graded from 0 to 15. Of 51 patients, only 13 showed normal kidney pathology. Fifteen patients showed glomerular abnormalities, 14 showed diabetic nephropathy, and 11 showed vascular nephropathy. There was one case each of reflux nephropathy and chronic pyelonephritis. The median histologic score was 5 points. Only 25.4% of patients had \u2264 3 points. Score more than 5 was observed in 47.1% of patients. Postoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at 3 to 36 months were obtained from 90.2% of patients, and of those, 34.8% had de novo CKD. Since no one had CKD in partial nephrectomized patients, we determined risk factors for CKD in radical nephrectomized patients. Cox regression analysis revealed that postoperative AKI, preoperative eGFR, and histologic score of non-neoplastic kidney were the independent predictors for CKD. We conclude that routine pathologic evaluation of non-neoplastic kidney provides valuable diagnostic and prognostic information."}

However, the possible functions of SNAI1 in the proliferation and apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma have not been clearly identified. In this study, we investigated the effects and mechanisms of SNAI1 in the proliferation and apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma using clinical samples and cell lines. We found that SNAI1 is highly expressed in the tissues of liver cancer compared with adjacent nontumor tissues. SNAI1 is also highly expressed in the hepatoma cell lines HepG2, SMMC-7721, and BEL-7402 compared with the human normal liver cell line L02. We also observed that SNAI1 expression was correlated with distal metastasis, incomplete tumor capsule formation, and histological differentiation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Moreover, we demonstrated that knockdown of SNAI1 via lentiviral vectors of RNAi against SNAI inhibited cell proliferation by inducing G1 arrest, which was accompanied by the downregulation of cyclin D1 but not that of cyclin A. In addition, knockdown of SNAI1 promoted apoptosis by decreasing the expression of Bcl-2. In conclusion, our findings revealed that SNAI1 is involved in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma via regulating the growth and apoptosis of tumor cells."}

They are important members of microbial communities that catalyze the biomining of sulfidic ores, thereby solubilizing metal ions. These microorganisms live under extremely acidic and metal -loaded environments and thus must tolerate high concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Cobalamin (vitamin B12) is a cobalt -containing tetrapyrrole cofactor involved in intramolecular rearrangement reactions and has recently been suggested to be an intracellular antioxidant. In this work, we investigated the effect of the exogenous addition of cobalamin on oxidative stress parameters in Leptospirillum group II strain CF-1. Our results revealed that the external supplementation of cobalamin reduces the levels of intracellular ROSs and the damage to biomolecules, and also stimulates the growth and survival of cells exposed to oxidative stress exerted by ferric ion, hydrogen peroxide, chromate and diamide. Furthermore, exposure of strain CF-1 to oxidative stress elicitors resulted in the transcriptional activation of the cbiA gene encoding CbiA of the cobalamin biosynthetic pathway. Altogether, these data suggest that cobalamin plays an important role in redox protection of Leptospirillum strain CF-1, supporting survival of this microorganism under extremely oxidative environmental conditions. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the protective effect of cobalamin against oxidative stress may help to develop strategies to make biomining processes more effective."}

How even distribution is achieved remains elusive, but diffusive motion and directed motility may play a role. Here we show that in the fungus Ustilago maydis ~95% of POs and LDs undergo diffusive motions. These movements require ATP and involve bidirectional early endosome motility, indicating that microtubule - associated membrane trafficking enhances diffusion of organelles. When early endosome transport is abolished, POs and LDs drift slowly towards the growing cell end. This pole-ward drift is facilitated by anterograde delivery of secretory cargo to the cell tip by myosin-5. Modelling reveals that microtubule-based directed transport and active diffusion support distribution, mobility and mixing of POs. In mammalian COS-7 cells, microtubules and F-actin also counteract each other to distribute POs.

IADFs are used as structural signals to gain information on relations between environmental conditions and eco-physiological processes during xylogenesis, with intra-annual resolution. To reach an unbiased synchronization of the IADF position within tree rings and seasonal fluctuations in environmental conditions, it is necessary to know the timing of cambial activity and wood formation, which are species- and site-specific processes. We applied the microcoring technique to analyze xylogenesis in Pinus halepensis and Arbutus unedo. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to study xylogenesis in a hardwood species forming frequent IADFs. Both species co-occur at a site in southern Italy characterized by a Mediterranean climate. To facilitate tree-ring dating and identification of IADFs, we performed traditional dendroecological analysis. We analyzed xylogenesis during summer, which is considered a constraint for xylogenesis and a trigger for IADF formation. We followed the different phases of cell development in the current wood increment with the aim of evaluating whether and which type of IADFs were formed. We additionally analyzed the same phases again in September and in winter to verify the possible formation of IADFs in fall and whether cell production and differentiation was completed by the end of the calendar year. Both species formed the same type of IADFs (earlywood -like cells within latewood), due to temporary growth restoration triggered by rain events during the period of summer drought. At the end of the calendar year, no cells in the phases of enlargement and secondary cell wall deposition occurred. A. unedo was more sensitive than P. halepensis because IADF s were formed earlier in the season and were more frequent in the tree-ring series. The dendro-anatomical approach, combining analysis of tree-ring series and of xylogenesis, helped to detect the period of IADF formation in the two species. Results are discussed in functional terms, highlighting the environmental conditions triggering IADFs, and also in methodological terms, evaluating the applicability of xylogenesis analysis in Mediterranean woods, especially when the formation of IADFs is not uniform around the stem."}

The goal of this phenomenological study was to document themes in the stories gathered from eight women veterans who had come back from war. Themes in the stories were: arriving with mixed sentiments; evolving to a changed view of self; permeating aggravation; confounding broken relationships, frequent deployments, and change in military status; remembering war experiences; and seeking opportunity for what is possible. Mental health issues can be observed in the themes. Including story as part of the mental health visit with veterans may be beneficial to veterans as they deal with the transition of coming back."}

To accomplish this aim, the authors applied a latent class growth analysis (LCGA) to services use data from a sample of rural CCI adults who reported their medical, mental health, and substance use treatment utilization behavior every 60 days for 1.5 years. LCGA established 1.5-year trajectories and demographic correlates of health services among rural CCI adults. For medical services, three classes emerged (stable-low users, 13%; stable-intermediate users, 40%; and stable-high users, 47%). For mental health and substance use services, three classes emerged (stable-low, 69% and 61%, respectively; low-baseline-increase, 10% and 12%, respectively; high-baseline decline, 21% and 28%, respectively). Employment, gender, medication usage, and depression severity predicted membership across all services. Results underscore the importance of social workers and other community services providers aligning health services access with the needs of the CCI population, and highlight CCI adults as being at risk of underservice in critical prevention and intervention domains."}

It is considered the result of complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors, being many of them unknown. Therefore, there is a dire necessity for the identification of novel molecular players for the understanding of this disease. In this data article we determined the protein expression profiles of whole protein extracts from cortex regions of brains from patients with Alzheimer\u05f3s disease in comparison to a normal brain. We identified 721 iTRAQ-labeled polypeptides with more than 95% in confidence. We analyzed all proteins that changed in their expression level and located them in the KEGG metabolic pathways, as well as in the mitochondrial complexes of the electron transport chain and ATP synthase. In addition, we analyzed the over- and sub-expressed polypeptides through IPA software, specifically Core I and Biomarkers I modules.

Frailty is an established measure for risk assessment in surgical cases. The aim of our study was to validate a modified 15 variable emergency general surgery specific frailty index (EGSFI). We prospectively collected geriatric (age > 65) emergency general surgery patients for 1- year. Post-operative complications were collected. Frailty Index was calculated for 200 patients based on their pre-admission condition using 50- variable modified Rockwood Frailty Index (FI). EGSFI was developed based on the regression model for complications and the most significant factors in the FI. ROC curve analysis was performed to determine cutoff for frail status. We validated our results using 60 patients for predicting complications. A total of 260 patients (200 developing, 60 Validation) were enrolled in this study. Mean age was 71 \u00b1 11 years, and 33% developed complications. Most common complications were pneumonia (12%), UTI (9%), and wound infection (7%). Univariate analysis identified 15 variables significantly associated with complications that were used to develop the EGSFI. A cutoff frailty score of 0.325 was identified using ROC curve analysis for frail status .Sixty- patients (frail: 18, non-frail: 42) were enrolled in the validation cohort. Frail patients were more likely to have post-operative complications (47% vs. 20%, p < 0.001) compared to nonfrail patients. Frail status based on EGSFI was a significant predictor of post-operative complications (OR =7.3, 95% CI = 1.7 - 19.8; p=0.006). Age was not associated with postoperative complications (OR =0.99, 95% CI = 0.92 -1.06; p=0.86). The 15- variable validated EGSFI is a simple and reliable bedside tool to determine the frailty status of patients undergoing emergency general surgery. Frail status as determined by Abstract the EGSFI is an independent predictor of post-operative complications and mortality in geriatric emergency general surgery patients.

The annual incidence of pertussis in the participating countries was obtained from relevant government institutions and/or national surveillance systems. We reviewed the changes in the pertussis incidence rates in each country to explore differences and/or similarities between countries in relation to pertussis surveillance; case definitions for detection and confirmation of pertussis; incidence and number of cases of pertussis by year, overall and by age group; population by year, overall and by age group; pertussis immunization schedule and coverage, and switch from whole-cell pertussis vaccines (wP) to acellular pertussis vaccines (aP). There was heterogeneity in the reported annual incidence rates and trends observed across countries. Reported pertussis incidence rates varied considerably, ranging from 0.01 to 96 per 100,000 population, with the highest rates generally reported in Estonia and the lowest in Hungary and Serbia. The greatest burden appears for the most part in infants (<1 year) in Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Romania, and Serbia, but not in the other participating countries where the burden may have shifted to older children, though surveillance of adults may be inappropriate. There was no consistent pattern associated with the switch from wP to aP vaccines on reported pertussis incidence rates. The heterogeneity in reported data may be related to a number of factors including surveillance system characteristics or capabilities, different case definitions, type of pertussis confirmation tests used, public awareness of the disease, as well as real differences in the magnitude of the disease, or a combination of these factors. Our study highlights the need to standardize pertussis detection and confirmation in surveillance programs across Europe, complemented with carefully-designed seroprevalence studies using the same protocols and methodologies."}

This burrowing worm -like species prefers soft soil with high moisture and organic matter. The major threats to the Sagalla caecilian are soil erosion caused by steep slopes, bare ground and water siphoning / soil hardening from exotic eucalyptus trees. The purpose of this study was to get a better understanding of the local people's attitude towards this species and how they can contribute to its continued conservation through restoration of its remaining habitat. In this study, it was found that 96% of Sagalla people are aware of the species, its habits and its association with soils high in organic matter. It was also found that 96% of Sagalla people use organic manure from cow dung in their farms. Habitat restoration through planting of indigenous plants was found to be ongoing, especially on compounds of public institutions as well as on private lands. Although drought was found to be a challenge for seedlings development especially on the low elevation sites, destruction by livestock especially during the dry season is also a major threat. In this study, it was recommended that any future habitat restoration initiative should include strong chain-link fencing to protect the seedlings from livestock activity. Recognizing that the preferred habitats for the species are in the valleys, systematic planting of keystone plant species such as fig trees (Ficus) creates the best microhabitats. These are better than general woodlots of indigenous trees."}

Adult patients with primary pulmonary lobectomy or segmentectomy procedures were categorized by the surgical approach (VATS vs open) and primary diagnosis (primary or metastatic lung cancer vs non-lung cancer). Patients requiring \u22653 units of blood products with at least 1 unit of PRBCs: \" significant bleeding \" cohort; those requiring <3 units: \" non-significant bleeding \" cohort; and those not requiring blood products: \" no bleeding \" cohort. A matched cohort analysis was performed between the \" significant bleeding \" and the \" no bleeding cohort \" using matching variables: hospital, lung cancer diagnosis, year of surgery, APR-DRG severity score, procedure type and approach, age, and gender. The \" All - patient \" cohort comprised 21,429 patients: 213 \" significant bleeding \"; 2,780 \" non-significant bleeding \"; and 18,436 \" no bleeding \". Overall incidence of significant chest bleeding was 0.99%. Patients from \" significant bleeding \" cohort and \" non-significant bleeding \" cohort had 2.5 days and 2 days (p < 0.0001) longer length of stay in the hospital compared to those in the \" no bleeding \" cohort, respectively. Overall, hospital costs for \" significant bleeding \" cohort were higher than \" no bleeding \" cohort for those who were covered under Medicare ($59,871 vs $23,641), were \u226576 years of age ($64,010 vs $24,243), had greater severity of illness ($97,813 vs $51,871) and underwent open segmentectomy ($74,220 vs $21,903).

A case report Injury of femoral vessels is an extremely rare complication in intertrochanteric femoral fractures. In most cases reported, the vascular lesion involves the superficial femoral artery, whereas in very few cases does it involve the profunda femoris artery. We report a case of acute bleeding due to laceration of a perforating branch of the profunda femoris artery caused by a sharp fragment of the displaced lesser trochanter in an intertrochanteric femoral fracture; the lesion was treated by transcatheter embolization. The arterial injury may be iatrogenic, occurring during intramedullary internal fixation, or less frequently, the injury may be due to the fracture itself, caused by a sharp bone fragment that damages the profunda femoris artery or one of its perforating branches. We believe that intertrochanteric femoral fractures with avulsed lesser trochanter are at risk for femoral vessel injuries caused by the displaced bone spike, and we advise meticulous clinical and laboratory monitoring pre- and post-operatively to prevent serious complications."}

Here, we show that angiogenesis also can be promoted by a direct interaction between brain tumor cells, including tumor cells with cancer stem -like properties (CSCs), and endothelial cells (ECs). As shown in vitro, this direct interaction is mediated by binding of integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 expressed on ECs to the RGD-peptide in L1CAM expressed on CSCs. It promotes both EC network formation and enhances directed migration toward basic fibroblast growth factor. Activation of \u03b1v\u03b23 and bone marrow tyrosine kinase on chromosome X (BMX) is required for migration stimulated by direct binding but not for migration stimulated by soluble factors. RGD-peptide treatment of mice with established intracerebral GBM xenografts significantly reduced the percentage of Sox2 -positive tumor cells and CSCs in close proximity to ECs, decreased integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 and BMX activation and p130CAS phosphorylation in the ECs, and reduced the vessel surface area.

Here we investigated the role of stress granules (SGs), ribonucleoprotein complexes that regulate mRNA translation, in the delayed translation of COX-2 mRNAs in IL-1\u03b2 - stimulated OA chondrocytes. Stimulation of human chondrocytes with IL-1\u03b2 activated the stress response genes and the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 that triggered the assembly of SGs.

No increase in COX-2 protein expression was observed during the persistence of SGs but enhanced expression of COX-2 protein was noted upon clearance of the SGs. Inhibition of SGs clearance blocked COX-2 mRNA translation whereas blocking the assembly of SGs by TIA-1 depletion resulted in rapid and increased production of COX-2 and PGE2.

We assessed beetle community dynamics in tropical dry forest sites in early, intermediate, and late successional stages, evaluating the influence of resource availability and seasonal variations in guild structure. We collected a total of 763 beetles from 23 species, including 14 bark beetle species, and 9 ambrosia beetle species. Local richness of bark and ambrosia beetles was estimated at 31 species. Bark and ambrosia composition was similar over the successional stages gradient, and beta diversity among sites was primarily determined by species turnover, mainly in the bark beetle community. Bark beetle richness and abundance were higher at intermediate stages; availability of wood was the main spatial mechanism. Climate factors were effectively non-seasonal. Ambrosia beetles were not influenced by successional stages, however the increase in wood resulted in increased abundance. We found higher richness at the end of the dry and wet seasons, and abundance increased with air moisture and decreased with higher temperatures and greater rainfall. In summary, bark beetle species accumulation was higher at sites with better wood production, while the needs of fungi (host and air moisture), resulted in a favorable conditions for species accumulation of ambrosia. The overall biological pattern among guilds differed from tropical rain forests, showing patterns similar to dry forest areas."}

We addressed the possibility that this restricted vulnerability stems from elevated Smn expression in motoneurons. To explore this, we established an ex vivo zebrafish culture system of GFP - marked motoneurons to quantitatively measure Smn protein and smn mRNA levels as well as promoter activity in motoneurons versus other cell types. Importantly, we uncovered that Smn levels are elevated in motoneurons by means of transcriptional activation. In addition, we identified the ETS family transcription factor Etv5b to be responsible for increased smn transcription in motoneurons. Moreover, we established that the additional supply of Smn protein in motoneurons is necessary for proper axonogenesis in a cell-autonomous manner. These findings demonstrate the reliance of motoneurons on more Smn, thereby adding a novel piece of evidence for their increased vulnerability under SMA conditions."}

This single-arm, open-label study of axitinib evaluated the efficacy, safety, and quality of life (QoL) in patients with mRCC whose disease progressed after one prior systemic first-line regimen. Primary objective was objective response rate evaluated per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and Choi criteria. Progression-free survival, overall survival, safety, and QoL were secondary end points. Due to the small study size, analyses comprised of descriptive statistics. Fifteen patients were recruited, five from Canada and ten from Australia, over a limited recruitment period. Thirteen patients received sunitinib as prior therapy. All patients had clear-cell carcinoma, eleven had prior nephrectomy. Liver, lung, and lymph nodes were the most frequent sites of metastases; one patient had brain metastasis. Median time on axitinib was 118.0 days (range: 3.5-645.0 days); estimated survival probability at 12 months was 57.8%. Two (13.3%) patients had objective responses per RECIST versus nine (60.0%) per Choi criteria. Six patients had progressive disease based on RECIST versus three per Choi criteria. Nine (60.0%) events of progression or death occurred by the end of study, and three patients continued to receive the study drug.

Mutations in specific genes encoding fatty acid reductases (FAR) responsible for fatty alcohol production cause abnormal development of pollen. A disrupted AtFAR2 (MS2) gene in Arabidopsis thaliana results in pollen developing an abnormal exine layer and a reduced fertility phenotype. AtFAR2 has been shown to be targeted to chloroplasts and in a purified form to be specific for acyl-ACP substrates. Here, we present data on the in vitro and in planta characterizations of AtFAR2 from A. thaliana and show that this enzyme has the ability to use both, C16:0-ACP and C16:0-CoA, as substrates to produce C16:0-alcohol. Our results further show that AtFAR2 is highly similar in properties and substrate specificity to AtFAR6 for which in vitro data has been published, and which is also a chloroplast localized enzyme. This suggests that although AtFAR2 is the major enzyme responsible for exine layer functionality, AtFAR6 might provide functional redundancy to AtFAR2."}

Encapsulation of pemetrexed in LPNs increased cellular uptake from 6% to 78%. Results of confocal microscopy analysis have shown that co-delivery of anti-miR-21 significantly improved accumulation of LPNs in the nucleus of U87MG cells. Nevertheless, more effective cytotoxicity results could not be obtained due to low concentration of anti-miR-21, loaded in LPNs.

In this study, we performed a Bayesian phylogeographic analysis to reconstruct the spatio-temporal dispersion pattern of this clade using eligible CRF35_AD gag and pol sequences available in the Los Alamos HIV database (432 sequences available from Iran, 16 sequences available from Afghanistan, and a single CRF35_AD -like pol sequence available from USA). Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm was implemented in BEAST v1.8.1. Between-country dispersion rates were tested with Bayesian stochastic search variable selection method and were considered significant where Bayes factor values were greater than three. The findings suggested that CRF35_AD sequences were genetically similar to parental sequences from Kenya and Uganda, and to a set of subtype A1 sequences available from Afghan refugees living in Pakistan. Our results also showed that across all phylogenies, Afghan and Iranian CRF35_AD sequences formed a monophyletic cluster (posterior clade credibility> 0.7).

Changes in reflux symptom s from baseline after 4 weeks of treatment were -8.4\u00b16.6 in the combination therapy group and -6.8\u00b15.9 in the monotherapy group (p=0.009). Over a 4- week treatment course, esomeprazole and rebamipide combination therapy was more effective in decreasing the symptoms of reflux esophagitis than esomeprazole monotherapy."}

The trajectory of integrating PC in comprehensive cancer centers, particularly pediatric centers, is unknown. We describe our 8- year experience of initiating and establishing PC with the Quality of Life Service (QoLS) at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. We retrospectively reviewed records of patients seen by the QoLS (n=615) from March 2007 to December 2014. Variables analyzed for each year, using descriptive statistics, included diagnostic groups, QoLS encounters, goals of care, duration of survival, and location of death. Total QoLS patient encounters increased from 58 (2007) to 1,297 (2014), new consults increased from 17 (2007) to 115 (2014), and mean encounters per patient increased from 5.06 (2007) to 16.11 (2014). Goal of care at initial consultation shifted from primarily comfort to an increasing goal of cure. The median number of days from initial consult to death increased from 52 days (2008) to 223 days (2014). A trend toward increased outpatient location of death was noted with 42% outpatient deaths in 2007, increasing to a majority in each subsequent year (range, 51%-74%). Hospital-wide, patients receiving PC services before death increased from approximately 50% to nearly 100%. Since its inception, the QoLS experienced a dramatic increase in referrals and encounters per patient, increased use by all clinical services, a trend toward earlier consultation and longer term follow-up, increasing outpatient location of death, and near- universal PC involvement at the end-of-life. The successful integration of PC in a comprehensive cancer center, and the resulting potential for improved care provision over time, can serve as a model for other programs on a broad scale."}

The medical records of 82 patients with Type 2 diabetes enrolled from 2005 to 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Fundus photographs were graded using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study methods. The associations between baseline risk factors and progression of DR were investigated. Seven of 28 patients treated with DPP4 inhibitors and 26 of 54 treated with other hypoglycemic agents showed progression of retinopathy, defined as one or more steps on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study scale (P = 0.043). Only treatment with DPP4 inhibitors significantly reduced the progression of DR in patients after propensity score matching (P = 0.009). Treatment with DPP4 inhibitors was associated with a lower risk of DR progression (P = 0.011). Treatment with DPP4 inhibitors was the independent protective factor against the progression of DR, aside from improving glycemic control. This is the first study to show the benefits of DPP4 inhibitors in reducing DR progression, and provides encouraging preliminary data for further evaluation of DPP4 inhibitors in the progression of DR in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial."}

Isolated from Plastic Dumped Soils and Their Ability to Degrade Low Molecular Weight PVC One of the utmost man-made problems faced today has been the ever - increasing plastic waste filling the world. It accounts for an estimated 20-30% (by volume) of municipal solid waste in landfill sites worldwide. Research on plastic biodegradation has been steadily growing over the past four decades. Several fungi have been identified that produce enzymes capable of plastic degradation in various laboratory conditions. This paper presents a study that determined the ability of fungi to degrade low molecular weight polyvinyl chloride (PVC) by the enzyme laccase. We have isolated a fungal species, Cochliobolus sp., from plastic dumped soils and they were cultured on Czapek Dox Agar slants at 30\u00b0C. The effectiveness of this fungal species on the degradation of commercial low molecular weight polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was studied under laboratory conditions. Significant differences were observed from the FTIR, GC-MS, and SEM results in between control and Cochliobolus sp. treated PVC."}

Mineral nutrients, amylose, \u03b2-glucans, amino acid and crude protein (CP) concentrations were measured in kernels. Whole flour samples were analyzed by ICP-AES/MS, HPLC and Elemental CHNS Analyzer. Results showed that Ce and Ti accumulation under MeNPs treatments did not differ from the control treatment. However, nCeO\u2082 and nTiO\u2082 had an impact on composition and nutritional quality of barley kernels in contrasting ways. Both MeNPs left \u03b2-glucans unaffected but reduced amylose content by approximately 21%. Most amino acids and CP increased. Among amino acids, lysine followed by proline saw the largest increase (51% and 37%, respectively). Potassium and S were both negatively impacted by MeNPs, while B was only affected by 500 mg nCeO\u2082 \u00b7kg(-1). On the contrary Zn and Mn concentrations were improved by 500 mg nTiO\u2082 \u00b7kg(-1), and Ca by both nTiO\u2082 treatments. Generally, our findings demonstrated that kernels are negatively affected by nCeO\u2082 while nTiO\u2082 can potentially have beneficial effects. However, both MeNPs have the potential to negatively impact malt and feed production."}

Even though the selection of analysis techniques depends on the linearity of the system under study, the importance of nonlinear contributions to cortical responses has not been formally addressed. The goal of this paper is to quantify the nonlinear contributions to the cortical response obtained from continuous sensory stimulation. EEG was used to record the cortical response evoked by continuous movement of the wrist joint of healthy subjects applied with a robotic manipulator. Multisine stimulus signals (i.e., the sum of several sinusoids) elicit a periodic cortical response and allow to assess the nonlinear contributions to the response. Wrist dynamics (relation between joint angle and torque) were successfully linearized, explaining 99% of the response. In contrast, the cortical response revealed a highly nonlinear relation; where most power (\u223c 80 %) occurred at non-stimulated frequencies. Moreover, only 10% of the response could be explained using a nonparametric linear model. These results indicate that the recorded evoked cortical responses are governed by nonlinearities and that linear methods do not suffice when describing the relation between mechanical stimulus and cortical response."}

To overcome this, we tested the utility of the bistable mammalian opsin melanopsin to examine G protein signaling in CNS neurons. Specifically, we used biolistic (gene gun) approaches to transfect melanopsin into cortical pyramidal cells maintained in organotypic slice culture. Whole cell recordings from transfected neurons indicated that application of blue light effectively activated the transfected melanopsin to elicit the canonical biphasic modulation of membrane excitability previously associated with the activation of GPCRs coupling to G\u03b1q-11 Remarkably, full mimicry of exogenous agonist concentration could be obtained with pulses as short as a few milliseconds, suggesting that their triggering required a single melanopsin activation-deactivation cycle. The resulting temporal control over melanopsin activation allowed us to compare the activation kinetics of different components of the electrophysiological response. We also replaced the intracellular loops of melanopsin with those of the 5-HT2A receptor to create a light-activated GPCR capable of interacting with the 5-HT2A receptor interacting proteins. The resulting chimera expressed weak activity but validated the potential usefulness of melanopsin as a tool for the study of G protein signaling in CNS neurons."}

The present study examined the involvement of FZD9 promoter methylation in the downregulation of FZD9 expression in leukemia cells. The expression of the FZD9 gene was absent in various leukemic cell lines, while it was restored following treatment with DNA demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Bisulfite sequencing analysis of the FZD9 promoter region showed that it was partially methylated in cell lines in which FZD9 gene was not expressed. Thus, DNA methylation in the promoter region may lead to inactivation of the FZD9 gene, which may represent and aberration associated with leukemia, since DNA was not methylated in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Methylation -specific polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the promoter region of the FZD9 gene was frequently methylated in primary or relapse acute myeloid leukemia (52.9%; excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia); however, methylation was infrequent in B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (5.6%). In conclusion, the present study indicated that the methylation profile of the FZD9 gene corresponded to that of a candidate tumor-suppressor gene in acute myeloid leukemia."}

In the study, 44 XTH protein genes from Medicago truncatula genome were identified using bioinformatics, microarray and RT-PCR. Each XTH was showed to possess a highly conserved domain ((D/N)-E-(I/L/F/V)-D-(F/I/L)-E-(F/L)-L-G), and most of XTHs possess four Cys in the C terminal region, which suggests the potential for generating disulfide bonds. Based on the XTH protein sequences, these XTHs can be classified into three major families and each family can be subdivided into more groups. Examination of the genomic location of XTH genes on M. truncatula chromosomes showed that the evolutional expansion of the genes was possibly attributed to localized gene duplications. To investigate the possible involvement of the XTHs responding to heavy metals and other abiotic stresses, the XTH genes were exposed to heavy metal (Hg or Cu), salt and drought stresses. There were 28, 21 and 21 MtXTH genes found to respond to HgCl2, salt and drought stresses, respectively, but their expression were different under the stresses. Some of the XTH genes were well confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). We further specified expression of a XTH gene Medtr4g128580 (MtXTH3) under different environmental stresses, and showed that MtXTH3 was induced by Hg exposure. These results indicated that a group of MtXTHs could be differentially expressed under the environmental stresses."}

However, there is evidence that not all youth benefit similarly from these programs. Familias Unidas is a family-focused intervention designed to prevent substance use and sexual risk among Hispanic youth and has recently demonstrated unanticipated reductions in internalizing symptoms for some youth. This paper examines variation in intervention response for internalizing symptoms using individual-level data pooled across four distinct Familias Unidas trials: (1) 266 eighth grade students recruited from the general school population; (2) 160 ninth grade students from the general school population; (3) 213 adolescents with conduct, aggression, and/or attention problems; and (4) 242 adolescents with a delinquency history. Causal inference growth mixture modeling suggests a three- class model. The two largest classes represent youth with low (60 %) and medium (27 %) internalizing symptoms at baseline, and both intervention and control participants show reductions in internalizing symptoms. The third class (13 %) represents youth with high levels of baseline internalizing symptoms who remain at steady levels of internalizing symptoms when exposed to the intervention, but who experience an increase in symptoms under the control condition. Female gender, low baseline levels of parent - adolescent communication, and older age were associated with membership in the high-risk class. These synthesis analyses involving a large sample of youth with varying initial risk levels represent a further step toward strengthening our knowledge of preventive intervention response and improving preventive interventions."}

While AKI severity is known to be associated with increased risk of short-term outcomes, its long-term impact is less well understood. Adult patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass graft surgery at eight centers were enrolled into the Northern New England biomarker registry (n = 1,610). Patients were excluded if they had renal failure (n = 15) or died during index admission (n = 38). Severity of AKI was defined using the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN). We linked our cohort to national Medicare and state all-payer claims to ascertain readmissions and to the National Death Index to ascertain survival. Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox proportional hazards modeling was conducted for time to readmission and death over 5 years. Within 5 years, 513 patients (33.8%) had AKI with AKIN stage 1 (29.9%) and stage 2 to 3 (3.9%). There were 620 readmissions (39.9%) and 370 deaths (23.8%). After adjustment, stage 1 AKI patients had a 31% increased risk of readmission (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.10 to 1.57), whereas stage 2 or 3 patients had a 98% increased risk (95% CI: 1.41 to 2.78) compared with patients having no AKI. Relative to patients without AKI, stage 1 patients had a 56% increased risk of mortality (95% CI: 1.14 to 2.13), whereas stage 2 or 3 patients had a 3.5 times higher risk (95% CI: 2.16 to 5.60). Severity of AKI using the AKIN stage criteria is associated with a significantly increased risk of 5-year readmission and mortality. Our findings suggest that efforts to reduce AKI in the perioperative period may have a significant long-term impact on patients and payers in reducing mortality and health care utilization."}

Obesity and diabetes are associated with low serum amylase (SA) levels, but the association between SA and metabolic disease is poorly understood. We investigated the association of low SA with diabetes and sex - specific associations of serum amylase with abdominal fat in older adults. In community-dwelling volunteers from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (778 participants, age 66.8\u00b113.6 years), we assessed abdominal fat by computed tomography and diabetes status using the American Diabetes Association criteria. Linear regression analyses assessed the cross-sectional associations between abdominal fat and SA, and logistic regression assessed the odds of diabetes, given low SA. In unadjusted analyses, individuals in the lowest SA quartile (<48\u03bc/L) had 1.97 greater odds of diabetes, (95% CI, 1.01-3.83) than those in the highest quartile (\u2a7e80\u03bc/L). This association was no longer significant after adjusting for visceral adipose tissue area (VAT, dm(2)), abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT, dm(2)) or BMI. In adjusted analyses, VAT and SAT were significantly associated with SA in both sexes.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of multiple-level cervical disk replacement (CDR) over single-level CDR for the treatment of cervical spondylosis. Some authors advocate for the multiple-level CDR instead of anterior decompression and fusion in cervical multiple-level spondylosis. However, whether the efficacy and safety of multi-level CDR are as favorable as that of single-level CDR remains controversial. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane library databases were searched up to November 2015 for controlled studies that compared the clinical outcomes of single-level and multiple-level CDR for the treatment of cervical spondylosis. The following outcomes were extracted and analyzed: prevalence of heterotopic ossification and reoperation, preoperative and postoperative Neck Disability Index scores, preoperative and postoperative Visual Analog Scale scores, and success rate using the Odom grading system. Ten studies involving 1402 patients were included: including 3 randomized controlled trials, 5 prospective studies, and 3 retrospective studies. No significant differences between single-level and multiple-level groups were found in terms of the prevalence of heterotopic ossification and reoperation rate, Neck Disability Index score, Visual Analog Scale score, and success rate using the Odom grading system. On the basis of this meta-analysis, clinical outcomes of multiple-level CDR are similar to those of single-level CDR for cervical spondylosis, which suggests the multiple-level CDR is as effective and safe as the single-level CDR.

This study looked at the effects of intravenous laser therapy (IVL) and percutaneous low level laser (PLLL) in the management of shoulder MPS. In this randomized controlled trial, 30 patients fulfilling inclusion criteria were randomly equally allocated to 3 groups, control, IVL and PLLL. Control group received 12 sessions of placebo low level laser, IVL group received 12 sessions of IVL therapy, and PLLL group received 12 sessions of PLLL therapy. All patients were trained for better body posture, body mechanics, gentle massage of trigger points, stretching exercises of affected muscle (trapezius), and received 10 mg of oral nortriptyline regimen every night for 3 months. Outcomes included pain severity, functional disability, and quality of life. Patients were assessed using Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), Pain Disability Index (PDI), and Short Form Health Survey (SF-12). Data collected were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA), Mann-Whitney and t tests. The mean of PDI and maximum pain intensity during day and night significantly reduced in both PLLL and IVL groups compared to control group. Although pain severity and PDI reduction was more pronounced in IVL group compared to PLLL group, the differences were not statistically significant. Also, quality of life statistically significantly improved in both IVL and PLLL groups compared to control group was more, and although higher in IVL group, the difference was not statistically significant when compared to PLLL group. No side effects were observed in the intervention groups. Intravenous laser and PLLL therapy had a positive effect on pain severity and PDI reduction, and quality of life in this study. Also no adverse event was recorded. Thus, intravenous lasers and PLLL therapy seem to be effective complementary modalities in managing patients with shoulder MPS."}

In silico investigations revealed two key interactions for the 5-HT1A / D4 selectivity of WAY-100635 and analogues. First, a hydrogen bond only found with the Ser 7.36 of D4 receptor appeared to be the key for a higher D4 affinity for newly synthesized aza analogues. The role of Ser 7.36 was confirmed as the affinity of aza analogues for the mutant D4 receptor S7.36A was reduced. Then, the formation of another hydrogen bond with the conserved Ser 5.42 residue appeared to be also critical for D4 binding."}

Due to their relative rarity, NTPn are poorly characterized, and, as such, limited data exist which describe these organisms. We aimed to describe disease and genotypically characterize NTPn causing invasive pneumococcal disease in South Africa. Isolates were detected through national, laboratory - based surveillance for invasive pneumococcal disease in South Africa and characterized by whole genome analysis. We predicted ancestral serotypes (serotypes from which NTPn may have originated) for Group I NTPn using multilocus sequence typing and capsular region sequence analyses. Antimicrobial resistance patterns and mutations potentially causing nontypeability were identified. From 2003-2013, 39 (0.1 %, 39/32,824) NTPn were reported. Twenty-two (56 %) had partial capsular genes (Group I) and 17 (44 %) had complete capsular deletion of which 15 had replacement by other genes (Group II). Seventy-nine percent (31/39) of our NTPn isolates were derived from encapsulated S. pneumoniae.

Our data provide valuable evidence of the triggering role of pre-hypertension and pre-diabetes together, on appearance and progression of MI even in healthy individuals and the significant predicting value of pre-hypertension on the occurrence of UA and CVD. In this regard, the value of pre-hypertension and pre-diabetes together, and the pre-hypertension state alone, are clearly superior to pre-diabetes state alone in predicting cardiovascular events."}

{"document_id": "27337390", "text": "Learned helplessness at fifty: Insights from neuroscience Learned helplessness, the failure to escape shock induced by uncontrollable aversive events, was discovered half a century ago. Seligman and Maier (1967) theorized that animals learned that outcomes were independent of their responses -that nothing they did mattered-and that this learning undermined trying to escape. The mechanism of learned helplessness is now very well-charted biologically, and the original theory got it backward. Passivity in response to shock is not learned. It is the default, unlearned response to prolonged aversive events and it is mediated by the serotonergic activity of the dorsal raphe nucleus, which in turn inhibits escape. This passivity can be overcome by learning control, with the activity of the medial prefrontal cortex, which subserves the detection of control leading to the automatic inhibition of the dorsal raphe nucleus. So animals learn that they can control aversive events, but the passive failure to learn to escape is an unlearned reaction to prolonged aversive stimulation. In addition, alterations of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex - dorsal raphe pathway can come to subserve the expectation of control. We speculate that default passivity and the compensating detection and expectation of control may have substantial implications for how to treat depression. (PsycINFO Database Record"}

The search for antimicrobial peptides has been performed with the aim to discover novel anti-infective agents active on pathogens in both planktonic and biofilm associated forms. The fragment 9-19 of human thymosin \u03b24 was studied through 1 \u03bcs MD simulation. Two main conformations of the peptide were detected, both constituted by a central hydrophobic core and by the presence of peripheral charged residues suggesting a possible mechanism of interaction with two models of biological membranes, related to eukaryotic or bacterial membrane respectively. In addition, the peptide was chemically synthesized and its antimicrobial activity was tested in vitro against planktonic and biofilm form of a group of reference strains of Staphylococcus spp. and one P. aeruginosa strain. The human thymosin \u03b24 fragment EIEKFDKSKLK showed antibacterial activity against staphylococcal strains and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 15442 at concentrations from 12.5 to 6.2 mg/ml and inhibited biofilm formation at sub-inhibitory concentrations (3.1-0.75 mg/ml). The activity of the fragment in inhibiting biofilm formation, could be due to the conformations highlighted by the MD simulations, suggesting its interaction with the bacterial membrane. Human thymosin \u03b24 fragment can be considered a promising lead compound to develop novel synthetic or recombinant derivatives with improved pharmaceutical potential."}

Small molecule antagonists to complement receptor 3 (CR3) have been widely sought, but a structural basis for their mode of action is not available. We report here on the structure of the human CR3 ligand-binding I domain in complex with simvastatin. Simvastatin targets the metal ion-dependent adhesion site of the open, ligand-binding conformation of the CR3 I domain by direct contact with the chelated Mg(2+) ion. Simvastatin antagonizes I domain binding to the complement fragments iC3b and C3d but not to intercellular adhesion molecule-1. By virtue of the I domain's wide distribution in binding kinetics to ligands, it was possible to identify ligand binding kinetics as discriminator for simvastatin antagonism. In static cellular experiments, 15-25 \u03bcm simvastatin reduced adhesion by K562 cells expressing recombinant CR3 and by primary human monocytes, with an endogenous expression of this receptor. Application of force to adhering monocytes potentiated the effects of simvastatin where only a 50-100 nm concentration of the drug reduced the adhesion by 20-40% compared with untreated cells. The ability of simvastatin to target CR3 in its ligand binding - activated conformation is a novel mechanism to explain the known anti-inflammatory effects of this compound, in particular because this CR3 conformation is found in pro-inflammatory environments. Our report points to new designs of CR3 antagonists and opens new perspectives and identifies druggable receptors from characterization of the ligand binding kinetics in the presence of antagonists."}

The standard approach today is to differentiate between the two based on the medical history of the past 90 days prior to admission. Measurable, quantitative assessment may be able to assist in this decision. The objective of this study is to find a measurable method of differentiating between community-acquired and healthcare-associated pneumonias. The records of 126 patients admitted with a diagnosis of pneumonia were divided into two groups based on the probable cause of their disease, in accordance with common practice. The routine laboratory work taken upon admittance was analyzed using logistical regression and Student's t-test. We have found that the red blood cell distribution width and the neutrophil -to- lymphocyte ratio, both routine parameters obtained in a simple blood count, can each assist in differentiating between community-acquired and healthcare-associated pneumonias. We have found two statistically significant parameters that may be used as adjuncts to the medical history, chest radiography and other parameters in forming an immediate clinical impression of a patient presenting with pneumonia."}

Few studies however have focused on autobiographical memory recall in older individuals with cognitive impairment. This study aims to analyze the impact of an individual reminiscence program in a group of older persons with cognitive decline living in nursing homes on the dimensions of cognition, autobiographical memory, mood, behavior and anxiety. A two-group pre-test and post-test design with single blinded assessment was conducted. Forty-one participants were randomized to an experimental group (n=20) and a control group (n=21). The first group attended five weekly individual reminiscence sessions. Changes in the outcome measures were examined for cognition (Montreal Cognitive Assessment; Autobiographical Memory Test), behavior (Alzheimer Disease Assessment Subscale Non-Cog) and emotional status (Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia; Geriatric Depression Scale, and Geriatric Anxiety Inventory). Participants attending reminiscence sessions exhibited better outcomes compared to the control group in cognition, anxiety and depression (p<0.001), and presented a higher number of retrieved autobiographical events, specificity of evoked memories and positive valence of events (p<0.001), and also presented lower latency time for recalling events, and lower negative recalled events (p<0.01). This study supports the potential value of reminiscence therapy in improving the recall of autobiographical memory. Reminiscence therapy can be helpful to maintain or improve cognitive function, decrease anxiety and manage depressive symptoms and altered behavior, but further investigation is needed to clarify long-term effects."}

Patients with severe asthma who experience exacerbations consume significant health care resources. To assess health care resource utilization and associated costs among patients with persistent severe asthma who experienced exacerbations compared with patients with persistent but nonsevere asthma. This retrospective analysis of a national administrative claims database identified patients aged \u2265 12 years who had at least 1 medical claim with an asthma diagnosis in 2012 and had continuous medical and pharmacy coverage under a commercial or Medicare Advantage plan from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2013. Patients were assigned to 1 of 2 mutually exclusive cohorts - persistent asthma (PA) or severe asthma (SA)-according to an established algorithm based on asthma -related health care resource use and pharmacy claims for controller medication. SA patients were required to meet PA criteria and also have evidence of \u22652 asthma exacerbations in 2012. Asthma -related health care resource utilization and costs were computed from asthma medication use (rescue and controller therapy) and medical claims with an asthma diagnosis in the primary position in 2012 and 2013. Adherence to controller therapy was assessed over 365 days by using the proportion of days covered (PDC), starting with the first claim for controller therapy in 2012. Differences between the PA and SA cohorts were analyzed by t-test for continuous variables and chi-square test for categorical variables. Asthma -related costs in 2013 were also analyzed using a generalized linear model with a gamma distribution and log link, adjusted for patient demographics (age, gender, region, and insurance type) and Quan-Charlson comorbidity score. A total of 65,359 patients were included: 63,597 (97.3%) PA patients and 1,762 SA patients (2.7%). Compared with the PA cohort, the SA cohort was older (mean age = 50.8 years vs. 46.5 years, P < 0.001) and had higher mean comorbidity score (1.47 vs. 1.31, P< 0.001). The mean count of all asthma medications fills was 2.2-fold (2012) and 2.1-fold (2013) higher in the SA cohort, compared with the PA cohort (P< 0.001). Mean PDC for all oral and inhaled controller therapy was also higher in the SA cohort compared with the PA cohort (0.80 vs. 0.65, P< 0.001). SA patients had a significantly greater mean count of asthma -related hospitalizations, emergency room visits, and ambulatory visits in 2012 and 2013 (P< 0.001). Unadjusted mean annual asthma -related costs in the SA versus PA cohorts were $6,496 versus $2,739 (P < 0.001) in 2012 and $5,174 versus $1,775 (P< 0.001) in 2013. Higher asthma -related costs were driven by greater mean annual asthma medication costs in 2012 ($4,545 vs. $1,738, P< 0.001) and 2013 ($4,068 vs. $1,348, P< 0.001). Adjusted mean annual asthma -related costs in 2013 were $3,336 greater (cost ratio =2.878, P< 0.001) in the SA cohort, and adjusted mean annual asthma medication costs were $2,672 higher (cost ratio=2.982, P< 0.001) in the SA cohort. Patients with SA who experienced 2 or more exacerbations had 2.1-fold greater use of controller medications across both study years and were more adherent to controller therapy than patients with PA. Despite more intensive pharmacotherapy, SA patients incurred 2.9-fold higher adjusted asthma -related costs and 3-fold higher adjusted asthma medication costs than PA patients. Patients with SA consistently demonstrated a higher rate of health care utilization. Funding for this study (HO-14-14443) was provided by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).

{"document_id": "27348405", "text": "Differential regulation of spontaneous and evoked inhibitory synaptic transmission in somatosensory cortex by retinoic acid Retinoic acid (RA), a developmental morphogen, has emerged in recent studies as a novel synaptic signaling molecule that acts in mature hippocampal neurons to modulate excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in the context of homeostatic synaptic plasticity. However, it is unclear whether RA is capable of modulating neural circuits outside of the hippocampus, and if so, whether the mode of RA's action at synapses is similar to that within the hippocampal network. Here we explore for the first time RA 's synaptic function outside the hippocampus and uncover a novel function of all-trans retinoic acid at inhibitory synapses. Acute RA treatment increases spontaneous inhibitory synaptic transmission in L2/3 pyramidal neurons of the somatosensory cortex, and this effect requires expression of RA's receptor RAR\u03b1 both pre- and post-synaptically. Intriguingly, RA does not seem to affect evoked inhibitory transmission assayed with either extracellular stimulation or direct activation of action potentials in presynaptic interneurons at connected pairs of interneurons and pyramidal neurons. Taken together, these results suggest that RA's action at synapses is not monotonous, but is diverse depending on the type of synaptic connection (excitatory versus inhibitory) and circuit (hippocampal versus cortical). Thus, synaptic signaling of RA may mediate multi-faceted regulation of synaptic plasticity. In addition to its classic roles in brain development, retinoic acid (RA) has recently been shown to regulate excitatory and inhibitory transmission in the adult brain. Here, the authors show that in layer 2/3 (L2/3) of the somatosensory cortex (S1), acute RA induces increases in spontaneous but not action-potential evoked transmission, and that this requires retinoic acid receptor (RAR\u03b1) both in presynaptic PV -positive interneurons and postsynaptic pyramidal (PN) neurons."}

However, none conducted simultaneous analysis of the three treatments. This study analyzed patients with allergic rhinitis receiving the three treatments to identify differences in demographic characteristic and medical use and thereby to determine drug use patterns of different treatments. The National Health Insurance Research Database was the data source, and included patients were those diagnosed with allergic rhinitis (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes 470-478). Chi-square test and Tukey studentized range (honest significant difference) test were conducted to investigate the differences among the three treatments. Visit frequency for allergic rhinitis treatment was higher in female than male patients, regardless of treatment with Traditional Chinese Medicine, Western medicine, or integrated Chinese-Western medicine. Persons aged 0-19 years ranked the highest in proportion of visits for allergic rhinitis. Traditional Chinese Medicine treatment had more medical items per person-time and daily drug cost per person-time and had the lowest total expenditure per person-time. In contrast, Western medicine had the lowest daily drug cost per person-time and the highest total expenditure per person-time. The total expenditure per person-time, daily drug cost per person-time, and medical items per person-time of integrated Chinese-Western medicine treatment lay between those seen with Traditional Chinese Medicine and Western medicine treatments. Although only 6.82 % of patients with allergic rhinitis chose integrated Chinese-Western medicine treatment, the visit frequency per person-year of integrated Chinese-Western medicine ranked highest. In addition, multiple-composition medicines were used more frequently than single-composition medicines, and mar huang (Ephedra sinica Stapf) was seldom used to decrease the risk of combining medications."}

Analyses of numerous murine models of spontaneous SLE have revealed a critical role for endosomal TLRs in the production of autoantibodies and development of other clinical disease manifestations. Nevertheless, the corresponding TLR9 - deficient autoimmune -prone strains consistently develop more severe disease pathology. Injection of BALB/c mice with 2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane (TMPD), commonly known as pristane, also results in the development of SLE-like disease. We now show that Tlr9(-/-) BALB/c mice injected i.p. with TMPD develop more severe autoimmunity than do their TLR -sufficient cohorts. Early indications include an increased accumulation of TLR7 - expressing Ly6C(hi) inflammatory monocytes at the site of injection, upregulation of IFN -regulated gene expression in the peritoneal cavity, and an increased production of myeloid lineage precursors (common myeloid progenitors and granulocyte myeloid precursors) in the bone marrow. TMPD - injected Tlr9(-/-) BALB/c mice develop higher autoantibody titers against RNA, neutrophil cytoplasmic Ags, and myeloperoxidase than do TMPD - injected wild-type BALB/c mice. The TMP - injected Tlr9(-/-) mice, and not the wild-type mice, also develop a marked increase in glomerular IgG deposition and infiltrating granulocytes, much more severe glomerulonephritis, and a reduced lifespan. Collectively, the data point to a major role for TLR7 in the response to self-antigens in this model of experimental autoimmunity. Therefore, the BALB/c pristane model recapitulates other TLR7 -driven spontaneous models of SLE and is negatively regulated by TLR9."}

CC activity / sensitivity, and the resulting functional significance, has not been well examined in COPD. We hypothesized that CC activity / sensitivity would be elevated in COPD, and related to increased pulse wave velocity (a marker of CV risk) and the ventilatory response to exercise. 30 COPD patients and 10 healthy age-matched controls were examined. Participants performed baseline cardiopulmonary exercise and pulmonary function testing. CC activity was later evaluated by the drop in ventilation with breathing 100% O2, and CC sensitivity was then assessed by the ventilatory response to hypoxia (\u0394VE/\u0394S pO2). Peripheral arterial stiffness was subsequently evaluated by measurement of pulse wave velocity (PWV) using applanation tonometry while the subjects were breathing room air, and then following chemoreceptor inhibition by breathing 100% O2 for 2 minutes. CC activity, CC sensitivity, PWV and the ventilatory response to exercise were all increased in COPD relative to controls. CC sensitivity was related to PWV; however, neither CC activity nor CC sensitivity was related to the ventilatory response to exercise in COPD. CC inhibition by breathing 100% O2 normalized PWV in COPD, while no effect was observed in controls.

The peptides were interacted with monolayers spread at the air - water interface and prepared from a 3:1 molar mixture of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol used to approximate the cell membranes of Gram positive bacteria. The Langmuir film balance measurements show that both peptides perturb the lipid monolayers causing an increase in surface pressure, and the BAM studies show that each results in the formation of small domains within the lipid films, around 5 \u03bcm diameter. The overall change in monolayer surface pressure caused by PG-1, however, is a little more pronounced than that due to RTD-1 (+8.5 mN\u00b7m(-1) vs +5.5 mN\u00b7m(-1)), and the rate of its initial interaction with the monolayer is a little more rapid than that for RTD-1. The neutron reflectivity studies also show differences for PG-1 and RTD-1, with the model fits to these data showing that the more amphiphilic PG-1 becomes fully embedded within the lipid film -causing an extension of the lipid acyl chains but leaving the thickness of the lipid headgroup layer unaffected-while RTD-1 is seen to insert less deeply-causing the same extension of the lipid acyl chains as PG-1 but also causing a significant increase in thickness of the lipid headgroup layer.

In the present study, chrysin loaded poloxamer micelles were developed. Two types of poloxamers, Pluronic F-68 and Pluronic F-127 were compared. It was found that chrysin loaded Pluronic F-68 micelles (CS-P68) and chrysin loaded Pluronic F-127 micelles (CS-P127) obviously increase the aqueous solubility of chrysin. The results also indicated that the type of polymer and ratio of drug to polymer affected size and desirable characteristics of the micelles. The micelle system of CS-P68 and CS-P127 formed at drug to polymer ratios of 1:4 and 1:2, respectively, was found to be the most suitable monodispersed system with a nanosize-range diameter. The in vivo study in zebrafish eggs indicates that the toxicity of CS-P68 and CS-P127 is a dose response. CS-P68 and CS-P127 at a drug dose of 10 ng/mL or less is safe for zebrafish embryo growth.

Thus, adoptive T-cell therapies would benefit from complementary modalities that enable their full potential without excessive toxicity. We aimed to improve the efficacy and safety of adoptive T-cell transfer by using adenoviral vectors for direct delivery of immunomodulatory murine cytokines into B16.OVA melanoma tumors with concomitant T-cell receptor transgenic OT-I T-cell transfer. Armed adenoviruses expressed high local and low systemic levels of cytokine when injected into B16.OVA tumors, suggesting safety of virus-mediated cytokine delivery. Antitumor efficacy was significantly enhanced with adenoviruses coding for murine interleukin-2 (mIL-2) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (mTNF\u03b1) when compared with T-cell transfer alone or viruses alone. Further improvement in efficacy was achieved with a triple combination of mIL-2, mTNF\u03b1, and OT-I T-cells. Mechanistic studies suggest that mIL-2 has an important role in activating T-cells at the tumor, while mTNF\u03b1 induces chemokine expression. Furthermore, adenovirus treatments enhanced tumor - infiltration of OT-I T-cells as demonstrated by SPECT/CT imaging of (111)In-labeled cells.

Given that global temperatures have warmed approximately 0.6 \u00b0C in the last century, it is necessary to consider how organisms will adjust to climate change. To better understand the degree to which mothers influence the sex ratios of their offspring, we use 24 years of nesting data for individual female loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) observed on Bald Head Island, North Carolina. We find that maternal identity is the best predictor of nest sex ratio in univariate and multivariate predictive models. We find significant variability in estimated nest sex ratios among mothers, but a high degree of consistency within mothers, despite substantial spatial and temporal thermal variation. Our results suggest that individual differences in nesting preferences are the main driver behind divergences in nest sex ratios. As such, a female's ability to plastically adjust her nest sex ratios in response to environmental conditions is constrained, potentially limiting how individuals behaviorally mitigate the effects of environmental change. Given that many loggerhead populations already show female-biased offspring sex ratios, understanding maternal behavioral responses is critical for predicting the future of long-lived species vulnerable to extinction."}

The aim of this study was to determine if RhoA activity is prognostic for overall survival (OS) in patients with resectable GA. Retrospective review was performed on a prospective database of GA patients who underwent potentially curative resection between 2003 and 2012 at a single institution. Tissue microarrays were constructed from surgical specimens and analyzed for phosphorylated RhoA, a marker of inactive RhoA signaling. OS was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and multivariate analysis was performed by Cox proportional hazards regression modeling. One hundred thirty-six patients with diffuse-type GA and 129 patients with intestinal-type GA were examined. Compared to intestinal-type GA, diffuse-type GA tumors were significantly associated with increased tumor size and advanced tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) classification system stage. In patients with diffuse-type GA, high RhoA activity was associated with significantly worse OS when compared to low RhoA activity (5-year OS 52.5 vs. 81.0 %, p = 0.017). This difference in OS was not observed in patients with intestinal-type GA (5-year OS 83.9 vs. 81.6 %, p = 0.766). On multivariate analysis of diffuse-type GA patients, high RhoA activity was an independent negative prognostic factor for OS (hazard ratio 2.38, 95 % confidence interval 1.07-5.28). Increased RhoA activity is predictive of worse OS in patients with diffuse-type GA who undergo potentially curative surgical resection. Along with findings from genomic studies, these results suggest RhoA may be a novel therapeutic target in diffuse-type GA."}

The time required for successful tracheal intubation, number of attempts, dental trauma severity and the need for optimization manoeuvres were recorded during cardiopulmonary resuscitation with and without chest compressions. The experience with computer games during the last 10 years were asked to the participants and recorded. McCoy laryngoscope yielded the shortest time for successful tracheal intubation both in the presence of and without chest compressions. During the use of McCoy laryngoscopes, fewer tracheal intubation attempts, lower incidence of dental trauma and lower visual analogue scale scores on the ease of intubation were recorded. Participants who are experienced computer game players using Macintosh, McCoy and McGrath achieved successful tracheal intubation in a significantly shorter time during resuscitation without chest compressions. Dental trauma incidence and number of tracheal intubation attempts did not show any significant difference between the four laryngoscopes being related to the rate of playing computer games. McGrath video laryngoscopes do not appear to have advantages over direct laryngoscopes for securing a smooth and successful tracheal intubation during rhythmic chest compressions.

This study aimed to explore nursing students' perspectives and experiences of nurse-patient communication in their clinical placement. The participants included 21 second-year undergraduates and 21 first-year master's students. Interviews were conducted in Cantonese and then transcribed in Chinese and translated into English. A content analysis approach was adopted to analyze the data. Five themes emerged from the interview data. 'The necessity of nurse-patient communication ' reveals why the students valued nurse-patient communication. 'The conversation contents ' describes the content of the conversations that students typically had with patients. The third theme is ' self-reflection on the nurse-patient communication '. The last two themes, 'the communication pattern in different hospital settings ' and 'the obstacles impeding nurse-patient communication ', are about the students' communication styles in different hospitals and the barriers they encounter. To improve students' communication skills, educators and clinical staff should listen to students, enhance students' reflective skills and strengthen their confidence. Through understanding students' difficulties in the nurse-patient communication experience and the skills that they lack, educators can provide them with helpful recommendations to improve their communication skills in clinical practice. The results of this study reveal that students' nurse-patient communication skills need to be improved."}

However, relatively little is known about the gradual changes in hippocampal structure, and its behavioral consequences, over the course of repeated stress. Behavioral analyses during 10 days of chronic stress pointed to a delayed decline in spatial memory, the full impact of which is evident only after the end of stress. In contrast, concurrent volumetric measurements in the same animals revealed significant reduction in hippocampal volumes in stressed animals relative to their unstressed counterparts, as early as the third day of stress. Notably, animals that were behaviorally the worst affected at the end of chronic stress suffered the most pronounced early loss in hippocampal volume. Together, these findings support the view that not only is smaller hippocampal volume linked to stress - induced memory deficits, but it may also act as an early risk factor for the eventual development of cognitive impairments seen in stress-related psychiatric disorders."}

However, the relationship between C9orf72 repeats and Alzheimer's disease (AD) was not clear. Additionally, there were few articles assessing C9orf72 in other ethnicities with ALS. In this meta-analysis, we aimed to investigate the relationship between C9orf72 repeat expansions (\u226530 repeats) and intermediate repeat copies (20-29 repeats) and AD or ALS. The results suggested positive correlations between C9orf72 repeat expansions and the risk of Alzheimer's disease (OR = 6.36, 95% CI = 3.13-12.92, and p < 0.00001), while intermediate repeat copies of C9orf72 gene were not associated with the risk of the disease.

The present study sought to address this barrier through creation and validation of a novel MRI -safe apparatus capable of delivering incremental, measurable amounts of pressure inside a scanning bore. We introduced an MR-safe device used to administer pressure -based pain. To test against a commercially available, MRI - incompatible algometer (AlgoMed), 199 participants reported their pain tolerance for both devices. A second experiment tested the validity of pressure -based pain in an MRI environment by comparing brain activation with established neural networks for pain. 10 participants performed an identical procedure to test for pain tolerance while being scanned in a 7T MRI scanner. Results support the validity and reliability of our novel device. In Study 1, pain tolerance with this device was strongly correlated with pain tolerance as measured by a commercially available algometer (r=0.78). In Study 2, this device yielded BOLD activation within the insula (BA 13) and anterior cingulate gyrus (BA 24); as pressure increased, activation in these areas parametrically increased. These findings correspond to other studies using thermal, electrical, or mechanical pain applications. Behavioral and functional data demonstrate that this new device is a valid method of administering pressure -related pain in MRI environments. Our novel MRI -safe device is a valid instrument to measure and administer pressure -based pain."}

New drug development has become essential because there is a risk of the parasite becoming resistant to Praziquantel, the only drug available for this infection. This study evaluated parasitological, immunological and histological parameters in mice infected with Schistosoma mansoni and treated with an herbal commercial medicine. This drug consists of menthol (30-55%) and menthone (14-32%). A 60 day treatment regimen with the herbal medicine decreased the number of S. mansoni eggs in the feces, liver, and intestine and reduced the number of hepatic granulomas. We observed a reduction of 84% in blood eosinophilia and a decrease in the IL-4 and IL-10 blood levels after treatment. Therefore, we propose that schistosomiasis treatment with this herbal medicine for 60 days has an immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory action in this animal model for schistosomiasis thus contributing to the decrease in physio pathological effects caused by S. mansoni infection."}

Shandong province of China. A total of 2761 elderly households are included in the analysis. CHE incidence among elderly households was 44.9%. The CHE incidence of empty-nest singles (59.3%, p=0.000, OR=3.19) and empty-nest couples (52.9%, p=0.000, OR=2.45) are both statistically higher than that of non-empty-nest elderly households (31.4%). An inverse association was observed between CHE incidence and income level in all elderly household types. Factors including 1 or more household elderly members with non-communicable chronic diseases in the past 6 months, 1 or more elderly household members being hospitalised in the past year and lower household income, are significant risk factors for CHE in all 3 household types (p<0.05). Health insurance status was found to be a significant determinant of CHE among empty-nest singles and non-empty-nest households (p<0.05). CHE incidence among elderly households is high in China. Empty-nest households are at higher risk for CHE than non-empty-nest households. Based on these findings, we suggest that special insurance be developed to broaden the coverage of health services and heighten the reimbursement rate for empty-nest elderly in the existing health insurance schemes. Financial and social protection interventions are also essential for identifie d at-risk subgroups among different types of elderly households."}

A preeclampsia rat model was also established by intravenous injection of AT1-AA extracted from the plasma of patient suffering from severe preeclampsia. The results showed that the plasma titer and positive rate of AT1-AA were significantly higher in women with severe preeclampsia than normal pregnant women. The antibody titer in cases of severe preeclampsia was associated with the grade of retinopathy, and positively correlated with the level of TNF-\u03b1 and VEGF. The animal experiment results showed that the modeled rats presented symptoms very similar to symptoms of human preeclampsia, including retinopathy. Ocular fundus examination showed retinal microvascular abnormalities, hemorrhaging and leakage in the severe preeclampsia. Morphological changes included edema, thickening of the INL and ONL, and pigment atrophy. TNF-\u03b1 and VEGF levels were increased in the vitreous humor and retina of the model rats. Our studies results suggest that abnormal expression of AT1-AA could induce damage to retinal capillary endothelial cells and increase vascular permeability, resulting in retinopathy."}

Since sexual dysfunction (SD) is not well characterized in GAD, a post hoc analysis of these trials was conducted to evaluate the effects of vilazodone on sexual functioning in GAD patients. Data were pooled from one fixed-dose trial of vilazodone 20 and 40 mg/day (NCT01629966) and two flexible-dose studies of vilazodone 20-40 mg/day (NCT01766401, NCT01844115) in adults with GAD. Sexual functioning was assessed using the Changes in Sexual Functioning Questionnaire (CSFQ). Outcomes included mean change from baseline to end of treatment (EOT) in CSFQ total score and percentage of patients shifting from SD at baseline (CSFQ total score \u226447 for males, \u226441 for females) to normal functioning at EOT. Treatment-emergent adverse events related to sexual functioning were also analyzed. A total of 1,373 patients were included in the analyses. SD at baseline was more common in females (placebo, 46.4%; vilazodone, 49%) than in males (placebo, 35.1%; vilazodone, 40.9%). CSFQ total score improvement was found in both females (placebo, +1.2; vilazodone, +1.6) and males (placebo, +2.1; vilazodone, +1.0), with no statistically significant differences between treatment groups.

Bioavailability of dissolved U(VI) was characterized in controlled laboratory experiments over a range of water hardness, pH, and in the presence of complexing ligands in the form of dissolved natural organic matter (DOM). Results show that dissolved U is bioavailable under all the geochemical conditions tested. Uranium uptake rates follow first order kinetics over a range encompassing most environmental concentrations. Uranium uptake rates in L. stagnalis ultimately demonstrate saturation uptake kinetics when exposure concentrations exceed 100 nM, suggesting uptake via a finite number of carriers or ion channels. The lack of a relationship between U uptake rate constants and Ca uptake rates suggest that U does not exclusively use Ca membrane transporters. In general, U bioavailability decreases with increasing pH, increasing Ca and Mg concentrations, and when DOM is present. Competing ions did not affect U uptake rates. Speciation modeling that includes formation constants for U ternary complexes reveals that the aqueous concentration of dicarbonato U species (UO2(CO3)2(-2)) best predicts U bioavailability to L. stagnalis, challenging the free-ion activity model postulate."}

IL-21, the most recently discovered member of the type-I cytokine family, exerts various effects on the immune system, including B cell activation, plasma cell differentiation, and immunoglobulin production. We aimed to assess the relationship of serum IL-21 levels in patients with type I AIH with clinical and laboratory parameters and histology. Ninety-two Japanese patients with liver disease (22 AIH, 20 primary biliary cholangitis, 19 drug-induced liver injury, 8 acute hepatitis B, 8 chronic hepatitis C, 10 non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, 5 viral hepatitis) and 10 healthy volunteers were recruited. Serum IL-21 levels were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Real-time polymerase chain reaction measured mRNA levels of Bcl-6, IL-21, and CXCR5 (Tfh-related factors) in peripheral mononuclear cells. Mean age at diagnosis of AIH was 58.6 years, male-to-female ratio was 4:18, 18.2 % of participants had cirrhosis, and 22.7 % had severe disease. IL-21 levels were significantly increased in the serum of patients with AIH compared to those with other liver diseases and controls (p < 0.0001). Particularly, serum IL-21 levels were significantly increased in severe AIH cases compared to non-severe cases (p < 0.05). Serum IL-21 levels correlated positively with total serum bilirubin levels (r = 0.46, p < 0.05), grading of necroinflammatory activity (r = 0.68, p < 0.005) and negatively with serum albumin levels in patients with AIH (r = -0.49, p < 0.05). In patients with biochemical remission of AIH, serum IL-21 levels remained elevated and correlated positively with serum IgG levels (r = 0.84, p < 0.01). Expression of Tfh-related factors, such as Bcl-6 and IL-21, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with AIH was significantly higher than that in healthy volunteers. IL-21 may play an important role in the pathogenesis and severity of AIH, and may present a promising target for AIH therapy."}

Pulmonary function measurements, health-related quality of life (SF-36), dyspnoea, subjective breathing and coughing ability and pain were evaluated before and 1 year after surgery in 150 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, valve surgery or combined surgery. One year after surgery the forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in 1 s were significantly decreased (by 4-5 %) compared to preoperative values (p < 0.05). Saturation of peripheral oxygen was unchanged 1 year postoperatively compared to baseline. A significantly improved health-related quality of life was found 1 year after surgery, with improvements in all eight aspects of SF-36 (p < 0.001). Sternotomy -related pain was low 1 year postoperatively at rest (median 0 [min-max; 0-7]), while taking a deep breath (0 [0-4]) and while coughing (0 [0-8]).

However, the endophytic microbiome in this plant is poorly defined. Endophytic bacteria play a role in supplying plants with the basic requirements necessary for growth and development. Moreover, these bacteria also play a role in the mechanism of salinity stress adaptation in plants. As a prelude to the isolation and utilization of these bacteria in Caliph medic farming, 41 bacterial OTUs were identified in this project from within the interior of the roots of this plant by pyrosequencing of the small ribosomal subunit gene (16S rDNA) using a cultivation-independent approach. In addition, the differential abundance of these bacteria was studied following exposure of the plants to salinity stress. About 29,064 high-quality reads were obtained from the sequencing of six libraries prepared from control and salinity-treated tissues. Statistical analysis revealed that the abundance of ~70% of the OTUs was significantly (p \u2264 0.05) altered in roots that were exposed to salinity stress. Sequence analysis showed a similarity between some of the identified species and other, known, growth-promoting bacteria, marine and salt-stressed soil-borne bacteria, and nitrogen-fixing bacterial isolates. Determination of the amendments to the bacteria l community due to salinity stress in Caliph medic provides a crucial step toward developing an understanding of the association of these endophytes, under salt stress conditions, in this model plant. To provide direct evidence regarding their growth promoting activity, a group of endophytic bacteria were isolated from inside of plant roots using a cultivation-dependent approach. Several of these isolates were able to produce ACC-deaminase, ammonia and IAA; and to solubilize Zn+2 and PO4-3. This data is consistent with the predicted occurrence (based on cultivation-independent techniques) of these bacteria and provides some insight into the importance of the endophytic bacteria in Caliph medic when grown under normal and saline conditions."}

Twenty hours after IVF, presumptive zygotes were cultured in synthetic oviduct fluid medium, supplemented with 0, 1, 2.5, and 5 \u03bcM crocetin (experiment 1) at 39 \u00b0C under humidified air with 5% CO2, 7% O2, and 88% N2. On Day 7, embryo yields were assessed and the blastocysts were vitrified by Cryotop method in 16.5% ethylene glycol, 16.5% DMSO, and 0.5 M sucrose. Finally, blastocysts produced on Day 8 in the absence (control) and presence of 1 \u03bcM crocetin were used for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labelling and differential staining to evaluate, respectively, the apoptotic rate and the allocation of cells into inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE) lineages (experiment 2).

Two patients with circumferential fusiform aneurysm, one being an aneurysm of the segments P2 and P3 of the posterior cerebral artery, diagnosed after a headache, and the other a partially thrombosed aneurysm of the lower basilar artery, diagnosed following ischemia of the brain stem. Endovascular treatment was performed by means of a vascular reconstruction technique that used at different surgical times: overlapping; a telescoped self-expandable stent, LEO+; and a flow-diverter device, SILK. Angiographic control was carried out at 6 and 12 months, to evaluate arterial patency, flow maintenance in the arterial branches and perforating vessels, and thrombosis of the aneurysm. The combined use at different surgical times of the self-expandable stent and flow-diverter device was technically successful in both patients. There were no complications during the procedure, nor in the long-term follow-up with full arterial vascular reconstruction, maintenance of cerebral perfusion and complete aneurysm occlusion at the 6- and 12- month angiographic follow-up. There was no aneurysm recanalization nor intra-stent stenosis. Circumferential fusiform aneurysm of the posterior circulation involving arterial branches or perforating vessels to the brain stem may be treated with this arterial reconstruction technique at different surgical times, using the self-expandable stent called LEO+ and the flow-diverter device SILK, minimizing the risk of complications and failure of the endovascular technique, with the potential for arterial reconstruction with thrombosis of the aneurysmatic sac, as well as flow maintenance in the eloquent arteries, in this type of cerebral aneurysm."}

There were no associations between protection from carriage and baseline levels of 6BPS IgG in serum or nasal wash, PspA - specific, or PspC - specific memory B cells or plasma cells. In volunteers who did not develop carriage, the number of circulating 6BPS memory B cells decreased and the number of 6BPS plasma cells increased postinoculation.

The method is demonstrated to reduce artefacts and recover CT -like Hounsfield units (HU) in reconstructed CBCT images of five lung cancer patients. Projection image based artefact corrections of image lag, detector scatter, body scatter and beam hardening are described and applied to CBCT images of five lung cancer patients. Image quality is evaluated through visual appearance of the reconstructed images, HU -correspondence with the planning CT images, and total volume HU error. Artefacts are reduced and CT -like HUs are recovered in the artefact corrected CBCT images. Visual inspection confirms that artefacts are indeed suppressed by the proposed method, and the HU root mean square difference between reconstructed CBCTs and the reference CT images are reduced by 31% when using the artefact corrections compared to the standard clinical CBCT reconstruction. A versatile artefact correction method for clinical CBCT images acquired for IGRT has been developed. HU values are recovered in the corrected CBCT images. The proposed method relies on post processing of clinical projection images, and does not require patient specific optimisation. It is thus a powerful tool for image quality improvement of large numbers of CBCT images."}

An administrative health care database including 8 years of records from 2 large commercial insurers and Medicare (a 5% random sample) was queried to identify all knee arthroscopies performed on patients aged at least 15 years using Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes. Each CPT code was designated as a high- or low-complexity procedure, with the former typically requiring accessory incisions or increased operative time. Deep infections were identified by a CPT code for incision and drainage within 90 days of surgery. Superficial infections were identified by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision infection codes without any record of incision and drainage. Patients were compared based on age, sex, body mass index, tobacco use, presence of diabetes, and Charlson Comorbidity Index. A total of 526,537 patients underwent 595,083 arthroscopic knee procedures. Deep postoperative infections occurred at a rate of 0.22%. Superficial infections occurred at a rate of 0.29%. Tobacco use and morbid obesity were the largest risk factors for deep and superficial infections, respectively (P < .001; relative risk of 1.90 and 2.19, respectively). There were also higher infection rates among patients undergoing relatively high-complexity arthroscopies, men, obese patients, diabetic patients, and younger patients (in order of decreasing relative risk).

Post-arthroscopic knee infections were more frequent among morbidly obese patients, tobacco users, patients undergoing relatively complex procedures, men, obese patients, diabetic patients, relatively young patients, and patients with increased comorbidity burdens in this study population. This knowledge may allow more informed preoperative counseling, aid surgeons in patient selection, and facilitate infection prevention by targeting individuals with higher inherent risk.

The objective of this study was to determine the association of prenatal and early childhood exposure to PCE - contaminated drinking water and development of adult-onset Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), endometriosis, difficulty conceiving and miscarriage. Five-hundred exposed and 331 unexposed female participants born between 1969 and 1983 completed questionnaires on demographic and lifestyle characteristics, and reproductive disorders. Residential locations from the prenatal period through five years of age were used to estimate early life PCE exposure with water modeling software. For any early life exposure to PCE, the adjusted risk ratio for PCOS was 0.9 (95% CI: 0.5-1.6). No statistically significan t associations were observed for increasing levels of exposure with PCOS or the other reproductive disorders. No meaningful associations were found among adult women with early life exposure to PCE - contaminated drinking water and adult-onset reproductive disorders."}

We evaluated the precopulatory responses of three different A. malasiaca populations collected from mandarin orange, willow and blueberry trees. Most of the males accepted mates from within the same host plant population as well as females from the willow and blueberry populations. However, significant number of males from the blueberry and willow populations rejected females from the mandarin orange population immediately after touching them with their antennae. Because all three of the female populations produced contact sex pheromones on their elytra, the females of the mandarin orange population were predicted to possess extra chemicals that repelled the males of the other two populations. \u03b2-Elemene was identified as a key component that was only found in mandarin orange -fed females and induced a rejection response in willow -fed males. Our results represent the first example of a female -acquired repellent against conspecific males of different host plant populations, indicating that the host plant greatly affects the female's sexual attractiveness."}

For evaluation of novel drugs, the Syrian golden hamster is considered as a clinically relevant laboratory model. In this study, two molecular parasite detection assays were developed targeting cathepsin-like cysteine protease B (CPB) DNA and 18S rRNA to achieve absolute amastigote quantification in the major target organs liver and spleen. Both quantitative PCR (qPCR) techniques showed excellent agreement with a strong correlation with the conventional microscopic reading of Giemsa-stained tissue smears. Using multiple single tissue pieces and all three detection methods, we confirmed homogeneity of infection in liver and spleen and the robustness of extrapolating whole organ burdens from a small single tissue piece. Comparison of pre - and post-treatment burdens in infected hamsters using the three detection methods consistently revealed a stronger parasite reduction in the spleen compared to the liver, indicating an organ - dependent clearance efficacy for miltefosine. In conclusion, this study in the hamster demonstrated high homogeneity of infection in liver and spleen and advocates the use of molecular detection methods for assessment of low (post-treatment) tissue burdens."}

Diabetes, hypertension, antepartum haemorrhage and small-for-gestational age (SGA) have been identified as important contributors to higher rates among Indigenous women. The objective of this study was to examine gestational age specific risk of stillbirth associated with these conditions among Indigenous and non - Indigenous women. Retrospective population-based study of all singleton births of at least 20 weeks gestation or at least 400 grams birthweight in Queensland between July 2005 and December 2011 using data from the Queensland Perinatal Data Collection, which is a routinely-maintained database that collects data on all births in Queensland. Multivariate logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95 % confidence intervals, adjusting for maternal demographic and pregnancy factors. Of 360987 births analysed, 20273 (5.6 %) were to Indigenous women and 340714 (94.4 %) were to non - Indigenous women. Stillbirth rates were 7.9 (95 % CI 6.8-9.2) and 4.1 (95 % CI 3.9-4.3) per 1000 births, respectively. For both Indigenous and non - Indigenous women across most gestational age groups, antepartum haemorrhage, SGA, pre-existing diabetes and pre-existing hypertension were associated with increased risk of stillbirth. There were mixed results for pre-eclampsia and eclampsia and a consistently raised risk of stillbirth was not seen for gestational diabetes. This study highlights gestational age specific stillbirth risk for Indigenous and non - Indigenous women; and disparity in risk at term gestations. Improving access to and utilisation of appropriate and responsive healthcare may help to address disparities in stillbirth risk for Indigenous women."}

Five electronic publication databases were searched to define, describe, or categorize PHI and discuss tropical cyclone, flood, storm, tornado, and tsunami-related disasters and their impact on PHI. The data were analyzed through aggregation of individual articles to create an overall data description. The data were grouped into PHI themes, which were then prioritized on the basis of degree of interdependency. Sixty-seven relevant articles were identified. PHI was categorized into 13 themes with a total of 158 descriptors. The highest priority PHI identified was workforce. This was followed by water, sanitation, equipment, communication, physical structure, power, governance, prevention, supplies, service, transport, and surveillance. This review identified workforce as the most important of the 13 thematic areas related to PHI and disasters. If its functionality fails, workforce has the greatest impact on the performance of health services. If addressed post-disaster, the remaining forms of PHI will then be progressively addressed.

In order to elucidate insect resistance biomarkers to lepidopteran pests, transcriptome and metabolome analyses following JA treatments were conducted with two broccoli cultivars, Green Magic and VI-158, which have differentially induced indole GSs, neoglucobrassicin and glucobrassicin, respectively. To test these two inducible GSs on growth of cabbage looper (Trichoplusia ni), eight neonate cabbage looper larvae were placed onto each of three plants per JA treatments (0, 100, 200, 400 \u00b5M) three days after treatment. After five days of feeding, weight of larvae and their survival rate was found to decrease with increasing JA concentrations in both broccoli cultivars. JA - inducible GSs were measured by high performance liquid chromatography. Neoglucobrassicin in Green Magic and glucobrassicin in VI-158 leaves were increased in a dose-dependent manner. One or both of these glucosinolates and/or their hydrolysis products showed significant inverse correlations with larval weight and survival (five days after treatment) while being positively correlated with the number of days to pupation. This implies that these two JA - inducible glucosinolates can influence the growth and survival of cabbage looper larvae. Transcriptome profiling supported the observed changes in glucosinolate and their hydrolysis product concentrations following JA treatments. Several genes related to GS metabolism differentiate the two broccoli cultivars in their pattern of transcriptional response to JA treatments. Indicative of the corresponding change in indole GS concentrations, transcripts of the transcription factor MYB122, core structure biosynthesis genes (CYP79B2, UGT74B1, SUR1, SOT16, SOT17, and SOT18), an indole glucosinolate side chain modification gene (IGMT1), and several glucosinolate hydrolysis genes (TGG1, TGG2, and ESM1) were significantly increased in Green Magic (statistically significant in most cases at 400 \u00b5M) while UGT74B1 and MYB122 were significantly increased in VI-158. Therefore, these metabolite and transcript biomarker results indicate that transcriptome profiling can identify genes associated with the formation of two different indole GS and their hydrolysis products. Therefore, these metabolite and transcript biomarkers could be useful in an effective marker - assisted breeding strategy for resistance to generalist lepidopteran pests in broccoli and potentially other Brassica vegetables."}

In 1964, Mathisen described an alternative method of ureteral reimplantation with lateralization of the neohiatus, creating an orthotopic course of the submucosal ureter. We have evaluated success and complication rates of both techniques that were applied sequentially at our departments. Forty-eight consecutive patients (83 ureters, 24 males /24 females) following Mathisen reimplantation were compared with 53 consecutive patients (98 ureters, 30 males /23 females) following Cohen reimplantation. Inclusion criteria were primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and no previous intervention. Reflux grades (Mathisen 58 ureters /69.9% VUR \u2265 III; Cohen 66 ureters /66.7% VUR \u2265 III) and the occurence of other complicating factors (ureteroceles, megaureters, posterior urethral valves) in both groups were comparable. After Cohen's reimplantation there were no immediate complications requiring intervention; during follow-up (mean 28.2 months) three patients (5.6%) suffered febrile urinary tract infections (UTIs), of which one (1.8%) was diagnosed with a persisting VUR. Persistent hydronephroses (\u2265II SFU) were recorded in six patients (13.2%). After reimplantation using Mathisen's technique, two patients (4.1%) suffered significant intravesical bleeding; during follow-up (mean 23.06 months) four patients (8.3%) suffered febrile UTIs, and seven patients (14.5%) were diagnosed with persisting VUR after a mean follow-up of 10.8 months. The patients with persistent VUR had more commonly high-grade (IV and V) VUR initially, compared to the whole group. Two patients (4.1%) had persistent hydronephroses (\u2265II SFU). Mathisen's technique for ureteral reimplantation yielded a significantly (p = 0.0256 patients, p = 0.006 ureterorenal units) lower success rate (85.5% patients, 89.2% ureterorenal units) in comparison with Cohen's technique (98.2% patients, 99% ureterorenal units). Although there was no intervention for obstruction, persistent hydronephrosis was more common in the Cohen group (13.2% vs. 4.1%, n.s.). Despite the advantages of an orthotopic ureteral orifice close to the bladder neck, as achieved by Mathisen's reimplantation, cross-trigonal ureteral reimplantation proved more reliable for VUR correction. As regards optimizing the results, patient selection for either technique could prove essential. Nevertheless, as regards the difficulties with ectopic ureteral orifices in the Cohen technique in the long-term follow-up, the concept of anatomic, orthotopic ureteral reimplantation should be pursued and the technique should be further refined."}

Aim To examine systematic differences in Medicare claims for healthcare utilization after hospitalization for ischemic stroke in a US population -based sample. Methods Claims were examined over a six-month period after hospitalization for 279 ischemic stroke survivors 65 years or older from the REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study. Statistical analyses examined differences in post - acute healthcare utilization, adjusted for pre - stroke utilization, as a function of race (African-American vs. White), gender, age, stroke belt residence, income, Medicaid dual-eligibility, Charlson comorbidity index, and whether the person lived with an available caregiver. Results After adjusting for covariates, women were more likely than men to receive home health care and to use emergency department services during the post - acute care period. These effects were maintained even after further adjustment for acute stroke severity. African-Americans had more home health care visits than Whites among patients who received some home health care. Having a co-residing caregiver was associated with reduced acute hospitalization length of stay and fewer post - acute emergency department and primary care physician visits. Conclusions Underutilization of healthcare after stroke does not appear to explain poorer long-term stroke outcomes for women and African-Americans in this epidemiologically -derived sample. Caregiver availability may contribute to reduced formal care and cost during the post - acute period."}

A data - model intercomparison To predict forest response to long-term climate change with high confidence requires that dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) be successfully tested against ecosystem response to short-term variations in environmental drivers, including regular seasonal patterns. Here, we used an integrated dataset from four forests in the Brasil flux network, spanning a range of dry-season intensities and lengths, to determine how well four state-of-the-art models (IBIS, ED2, JULES, and CLM3.5) simulated the seasonality of carbon exchanges in Amazonian tropical forests. We found that most DGVMs poorly represented the annual cycle of gross primary productivity (GPP), of photosynthetic capacity (Pc), and of other fluxes and pools. Models simulated consistent dry-season declines in GPP in the equatorial Amazon (Manaus K34, Santarem K67, and Caxiuan\u00e3 CAX); a contrast to observed GPP increases. Model simulated dry-season GPP reductions were driven by an external environmental factor, ' soil water stress ' and consequently by a constant or decreasing photosynthetic infrastructure (Pc), while observed dry-season GPP resulted from a combination of internal biological (leaf -flush and abscission and increased Pc) and environmental (incoming radiation) causes. Moreover, we found models generally overestimated observed seasonal net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and respiration (Re) at equatorial locations. In contrast, a southern Amazon forest (Jar\u00fa RJA) exhibited dry-season declines in GPP and Re consistent with most DGVMs simulations. While water limitation was represented in models and the primary driver of seasonal photosynthesis in southern Amazonia, changes in internal biophysical processes, light-harvesting adaptations (e.g., variations in leaf area index (LAI) and increasing leaf -level assimilation rate related to leaf demography), and allocation lags between leaf and wood, dominated equatorial Amazon carbon flux dynamics and were deficient or absent from current model formulations. Correctly simulating flux seasonality at tropical forests requires a greater understanding and the incorporation of internal biophysical mechanisms in future model developments."}

Thus women with PCOS may be at elevated risk of cardiovascular disease. Present study aims to evaluate Vitamin D status and to assess its association with metabolic and endocrinal dysregulations in women with PCOS, which might help in early identification and prevention of future symptomatic cardiac disease. A total of 44 women with PCOS, diagnosed by Rotterdam criteria and 45 healthy control without PCOS, were evaluated for Vitamin D and cardiometabolic risk factors, including fasting plasma glucose, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hs-CRP. That apart, several endocrinal parameters of hyperandrogenism were also examined. Several correlation studies were determined to establish the role of Vitamin D as a cardiometabolic risk factor in PCOS. Results were expressed as mean\u00b1SD and were statistically analysed using SPSS software version 16, unpaired student's t-test and Pearson's correlation coefficient. We found lower levels of Vitamin D, which was statistically significant as compared to healthy controls. Hyperinsulinemia, rise in insulin resistance and marked dyslipidemia was observed in the present study. Another relevant finding was significant correlation of Vitamin D with insulin and Homeostatic Model of Assessment- Insulin Resistance Index (HOMA-IR). Hypovitaminosis D was prevalent in PCOS. This was related to metabolic and hormonal disorders in PCOS. Possibly this combined with impaired fasting glucose, IR and dyslipidemia, could account for Cardio vascular risks in PCOS.

Previously we showed that support resources can facilitate resilience in carers, but the relationship is complex and varies by relationship type. The current paper aims to explore social support as a key component of resilience to identify the availability, function and perceived functional aspects of support provided to older spousal dementia carers. We conducted 23 in-depth qualitative interviews with spousal carers from two carer support groups and a care home in North West England. Family and friends served a wide range of functions but were equally available to resilient and non-resilient participants. Family support was perceived as unhelpful if it created feelings of over-dependence. Participants were less likely to resist involvement of grandchildren due to their relatively narrow and low-level support functions. Friend support was perceived as most helpful when it derived from those in similar circumstances. Neighbours played a functionally unique role of crisis management. These perceptions may moderate the effect of support on resilience. Family and friend support is not always sufficient to facilitate resilience. Support functions facilitate resilience only if they are perceived to match need. Implications of these findings are discussed."}

Use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin, has been reported to be beneficial in inflammation - associated diseases like cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular disorders. Their precise molecular mechanisms, however, are not clearly understood. Our previous studies on aspirin treated HepG2 cells strongly suggest cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. In the present study, we have further demonstrated that HepG2 cells treated with LPS alone or in combination with aspirin induces subcellular toxic responses which are accompanied by increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, oxidative stress, mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction and apoptosis. The LPS / Aspirin induced toxicity was attenuated by pre-treatment of cells with N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). Alterations in oxidative stress and glutathione - dependent redox-homeostasis were more pronounced in mitochondria compared to extra - mitochondrial cellular compartments. Pre-treatment of HepG2 cells with NAC exhibited a selective protection in redox homeostasis and mitochondrial dysfunction.

MAP cases were defined by the need for clinical intervention at delivery beyond spontaneous placental delivery or simple manual extraction of the placenta. Controls consisted of patients with placentas sent for examination due to a history of maternal malignancy with no clinical suspicion of accreta. Placental pathologic findings of maternal vascular underperfusion (MVU), acute inflammation, chronic inflammation, fetal vascular obstruction and hemorrhage were recorded and compared using bivariable and multivariable analyses.

Conversely, scleractinian or reef-building coral microbiomes have been heavily examined in light of the threats of climate change. Muricea californica and Muricea fruticosa are two co-occurring species of gorgonian octocoral abundantly found in the kelp forests of southern California, and thus provide an excellent basis to determine if octocoral microbiomes are host specific. Using Illumina MiSeq amplicon sequencing and replicate samples, we evaluated the microbiomes collected from multiple colonies of both species of Muricea to measure both inter- and intra-colony microbiome variabilities. In addition, microbiomes from overlying sea water and nearby zoanthids (another benthic invertebrate) were also included in the analysis to evaluate whether bacterial taxa specifically associate with octocorals. This is also the first report of microbiomes from these species of Muricea. We show that microbiomes isolated from each sample type are distinct, and specifically, that octocoral species type had the greatest effect on predicting the composition of the Muricea microbiome. Bacterial taxa contributing to compositional differences include distinct strains of Mycoplasma associated with either M. californica or M. fruticosa, an abundance of Spirochaetes observed on M. californica, and a greater diversity of \u03b3-Proteobacteria associated with M. fruticosa. Many of the bacterial taxa contributing to these differences are known for their presence in photosymbiont-containing invertebrate microbiomes."}

The low solubility of 2,8-dihydroxyadenine results in precipitation and formation of urinary crystals and renal stones. Patients with this disorder usually have recurrent nephrolithiasis and can develop nephropathy secondary to crystal precipitation in the renal parenchyma. The disease is most often underdiagnosed and can recur in renal transplant, causing graft failure. Lack of specific clinical manifestations, chemical and radiologic features identical to those shown with uric acid stones, and lack of awareness among clinicians are among the causes for the underdiagnoses of this treatable disease. Allopurinol, a xanthine dehydrogenase inhibitor, is the mainstay of treatment, supported by high fluid intake and dietary modifications. The possibility of adenine phosphoribosyl transferase deficiency should be considered in all cases of urolithiasis in children, patients with recurrent urolithiasis, and patients with urolithiasis associated with renal failure of unknown cause, including patients with end-stage renal disease and renal transplant recipients. Here, we report a case of a 41-year-old female patient who had a late diagnosis of 2,8-dihydroxyadenine nephropathy -induced end-stage renal disease, made on the native nephrectomy that accompanied the renal transplant, and who had a timely intervention that prevented recurrence in the graft."}

However, there is a paucity of research on the links between social capital and healthy ageing in a developing country environment, where universal social security coverage is absent and health infrastructure is poor. In this paper, we develop and empirically test a model of the linkages between social capital and the health outcomes for older adults in Indonesia, using data from the Indonesian Family Life Survey-East (IFLS-East), conducted in 2012. Using multivariate regression analysis, we examine whether social capital plays a role in mitigating poor health among older individuals aged 50 years and above in Indonesia 's most vulnerable provinces. We test the robustness of these social capital variables across different health measures (self-assessed health, Activities of Daily Living (ADL), measures of chronic illness and mental health measures), as well as across different demographic groups, after controlling for an array of socio-economic, demographic and geographic characteristics. Our findings show that access to better social capital (using measures of neighbourhood trust and community participation) is associated with a higher degree of physical mobility, independence, and mental well-being among older individuals but has no influence on chronic illnesses. These results are consistent when we estimate samples disaggregated by gender, rural / urban residence, and by age categories. From a policy perspective these results point to the importance of social capital measures in moderating the influence of poor health, particularly in the Activities of Daily Living."}

Levels of interleukins may correlate with overall survival and may directly or indirectly affect some of the regulators of coagulation and fibrinolysis, thereby disrupting hemostasis and thrombosis. Our hypothesis is that in sepsis-associated coagulopathies (SACs), interleukins may be upregulated, leading to hemostatic imbalance by generating thrombogenic mediators. We profiled the levels of interleukins IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 in addition to d-dimer (DD) in patients with SAC and in normal donors. We observed the highest increase in interleukins IL-6 (322-fold), IL-8 (48-fold), IL-10 (72-fold), and DD (18-fold). This suggests that interleukins such as IL-6 and IL-10 have a close association with coagulopathy and fibrinolytic dysregulation in sepsis and can be considered as candidates for potential therapeutic targets in SAC."}

While many clinical trials are ongoing to test therapies for treating the heart after myocardial infarction (MI) and heart failure, there are few options doctors able to currently give patients to repair the heart. This eventually leads to decreased ventricular contractility and increased systemic disease, including vascular disorders that could result in stroke. Small peptides such as thymosin \u03b24 (T\u03b24) are upregulated in the cardiovascular niche during fetal development and after injuries such as MI, providing increased neovasculogenesis and paracrine signals for endogenous stem cell recruitment to aid in wound repair. New research is looking into the effects of in vivo administration of T\u03b24 through injections and coatings on implants, as well as its effect on cell differentiation. Results so far demonstrate T\u03b24 administration leads to robust increases in angiogenesis and wound healing in the heart after MI and the brain after stroke, and can differentiate adult stem cells toward the cardiac lineage for implantation to the heart to increase contractility and survival. Future work, some of which is currently in clinical trials, will demonstrate the in vivo effect of these therapies on human patients, with the goal of helping the millions of people worldwide affected by cardiovascular disease."}

Enteric redmouth disease is traditionally associated with rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss, Walbaum), but its incidence in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is increasing. Yersinia ruckeri isolates recovered from diseased Atlantic salmon have been poorly characterized, and very little is known about the relationship of the isolates associated with these two species. Phenotypic approaches were used to characterize 109 Y. ruckeri isolates recovered over a 14-year period from infected Atlantic salmon in Scotland; 26 isolates from infected rainbow trout were also characterized. Biotyping, serotyping, and comparison of outer membrane protein profiles identified 19 Y. ruckeri clones associated with Atlantic salmon but only five associated with rainbow trout; none of the Atlantic salmon clones occurred in rainbow trout and vice versa These findings suggest that distinct subpopulations of Y. ruckeri are associated with each species. A new O serotype (designated O8) was identified in 56 biotype 1 Atlantic salmon isolates and was the most common serotype identified from 2006 to 2011 and in 2014, suggesting an increased prevalence during the time period sampled. Rainbow trout isolates were represented almost exclusively by the same biotype 2, serotype O1 clone that has been responsible for the majority of ERM outbreaks in this species within the United Kingdom since the 1980s. However, the identification of two biotype 2, serotype O8 isolates in rainbow trout suggests that vaccines containing serotypes O1 and O8 should be evaluated in both rainbow trout and Atlantic salmon for application in Scotland. Vaccination plays an important role in protecting Atlantic salmon against the bacterial pathogen Yersinia ruckeri, but, in recent years, there has been an increasing incidence of vaccine breakdown in salmon. This is largely because current vaccines are aimed at rainbow trout and are based on serotypes specific for this species. A wider range of serotypes is responsible for infection in Atlantic salmon, but very little is known about the diversity of these strains and their relationships to those recovered from rainbow trout. In the present study, we demonstrate that Y. ruckeri isolates recovered from diseased Atlantic salmon in Scotland are more diverse than those from rainbow trout; furthermore, isolates from the two species represent distinct subpopulations. In addition, a new O serotype was identified that is responsible for a significant proportion of the disease in Atlantic salmon. Our findings are likely to have important implications for the development of improved vaccines against Y. ruckeri."}
{"document_id": "27452524", "text": "CD84 mediates CLL - microenvironment interactions Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a malignant disease of small mature lymphocytes. Signals from the CLL microenvironment promote progression of the disease and induce drug resistance. This phenomenon is largely dependent on direct contact between the malignant B cells and stromal cells. CD84 belongs to the signaling lymphocyte activation molecule family of immunoreceptors, which self-associates, forming an orthogonal homophilic dimer. We therefore hypothesized that CD84 may bridge between CLL cells and their microenvironment, promoting cell survival. Our in vitro results show that CD84 expressed on CLL cells interact with CD84 expressed on cells in their microenvironment, inducing cell survival in both sides. Blocking CD84 in vitro and in vivo disrupt the interaction of CLL cells with their microenvironment, resulting in induced cell death. Thus, our findings suggest novel therapeutic strategies based on the blockade of this CD84 - dependent survival pathway."}

At the maximum, a deviation Grade 5 leads to the death of the subject. This method of classification was applied to deviations noted in the center over the last 3 years.

Specifically, a cell's microenvironment within the human body contains highly optimised, fractal topographical cues, which directs precise cell behaviour. However, recreating biomimetic, fractal topographies in vitro is not a trivial process and a number of fabrication methods have been proposed but often fail to precisely control the spatial resolution of features at different lengths scales and hence, to provide true biomimetic properties. Here, we propose a method of accurately reproducing the self-similar, micro and nanoscale topography of a human biological tissue into a synthetic polymer through an innovative fabrication process. The biological tissue surface was characterised using atomic force microscopy (AFM) to obtain spatial data in X, Y and Z, which was converted into a grayscale 'digital photomask'. As a result of maskless grayscale optical lithography followed by modified deep reactive ion etching and replica molding, we were able to accurately reproduce the fractal topography of acellular dermal matrix (ADM) into polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Characterisation using AFM at three different length scales revealed that the nano and micro-topographical features, in addition to the fractal dimension, of native ADM were reproduced in PDMS. In conclusion, it has been shown that the fractal topography of biological surfaces can be mimicked in synthetic materials using the novel fabrication process outlined, which may be applied to significantly enhance medical device biocompatibility and performance."}

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of extracellular acidic pH on proliferation, invasion, and drug - induced apoptosis in acute lymphoblastic cells. The cells were cultured in different pH (pH 6.6 and pH 7.4) for 12 days. Cell proliferation was assessed by MTT assay and cell invasion was assayed by invasion assay and gene expression analysis of MMP-9. Drug - induced apoptosis was evaluated after exposure to doxorubicin for 24 hours by annexin V / PI staining and gene expression analysis of BAX pro-apoptotic protein. The results indicated the enhanced growth and invasion of leukemic cells at pH 6.6 (P \u2264 0.05). Furthermore, the cells at pH 6.6 were resistant to apoptosis by doxorubicin (P \u2264 0.05). It can be concluded that acidic pH increases the proliferation, invasion and reduces the drug - induced apoptosis in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Extracellular acidity can influence the behavior of leukemic cells and therefore, the manipulation of extracellular liquid can be selected as a therapeutic strategy for leukemia, especially for acute lymphoblastic leukemia."}

Little is known about patients with 1 dose - reduction criterion who received the 5 mg twice daily dose of apixaban. To determine the frequency of 1 dose - reduction criterion and whether the effects of the 5 mg twice daily dose of apixaban on stroke or systemic embolism and bleeding varied among patients with 1 or no dose - reduction criteria.

The first patient was enrolled in the ARISTOTLE trial on December 19, 2006, and follow-up was completed on January 30, 2011. Data were analyzed from January 2015 to May 30, 2016. Analysis of major bleeding included events during study drug treatment. Analysis of stroke or systemic embolism was based on intention to treat. Of the patients with 1 or no dose - reduction criteria assigned to receive the 5 mg twice daily dose of apixaban or warfarin, 3966 had 1 dose - reduction criterion; these patients had higher rates of stroke or systemic embolism (HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.20-1.81) and major bleeding (HR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.62-2.20) compared with those with no dose - reduction criteria (n = 13 356).

We previously found that PgP activity increases in rat brain microvessels concomitant with decreased central nervous system drug delivery in response to acute peripheral inflammatory pain. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that PgP traffics to the luminal plasma membrane of the microvessel endothelial cells from intracellular stores during peripheral inflammatory pain. Using immunofluorescence microscopy, we detected PgP in endothelial cell nuclei and in the luminal plasma membrane in control animals. Following peripheral inflammatory pain, luminal PgP staining increased while staining in the nucleus decreased. Biochemical analysis of nuclear PgP content confirmed our visual observations. Peripheral inflammatory pain also increased endothelial cell luminal staining of polymerase 1 and transcript release factor / cavin1 and serum deprivation response protein / cavin2, two caveolar scaffold proteins, without changing caveolin1 or protein kinase C delta binding protein / cavin3 location. Our data (a) indicate that PgP traffics from stores in the nucleus to the endothelial cell luminal membrane in response to peripheral inflammatory pain; (b) provide an explanation for our previous observation that peripheral inflammatory pain inhibits central nervous system drug uptake; and (c) suggest a novel regulatory mechanism for PgP activity in rat brain."}

{"document_id": "27469581", "text": "What can the Canadians and Americans learn from each other's health care systems? Numerous papers have been written comparing the Canadian and US healthcare systems, and a number of health policy experts have recommended that the Americans implement their single-payer system to save 12-20% of its healthcare expenditures. This paper is different in that it assumes that neither country will undertake a significant philosophic or structural change in their healthcare system, but there are lessons to be learned that are inherent in one that could be a major breakthrough for the other. Following the model in Canada and in Western Europe, the USA could implement universal health insurance so that the 32.0 million (2015) Americans still uninsured would have at least minimal coverage when incurring medical expenditures. Also, the USA could use smart cards to evaluate eligibility and to process health insurance claims; these changes resulting in an estimated 15% reduction in US health expenditures without adversely effecting access or quality of care. Such a strategy would result in the eventual loss of 2.5 million white-collar jobs at hospitals, physician offices and insurance companies, a long-term economic gain. Only a few would agree with the statement that Canada already functions with a multi-payer reimbursement system as evidenced by (1) a federal - provincial, tax - supported plan, administered by each of the provinces, providing universal coverage for hospital and physician services and (2) roughly 60% of its residents receiving employer-paid health insurance benefits, underwritten primarily by investor-owned plans, that are less than effective to reimburse for pharmaceuticals, dental and other healthcare services. What could be learned from the USA and particularly from Western European countries is possibly implementing an approach, whereby at least upper-income Canadians could opt out of their federal - provincial plan and purchase private insurance coverage - being eligible for far more comprehensive \"private\" benefits for hospital, physician, pharmaceutical, dental and other healthcare services. Aside from generating billions of additional needed revenues from the private sector, it could (1) help eliminate long waits for non-emergent physicians' care by appointing newly minted specialists to their medical staffs; (2) offer prompt admissions for elective cases to \" private \" wings of hospitals; (3) increase available funding for what is currently an undercapitalized system; (4) enhance the system's sluggish operations; and (5) encourage more competition among various providers. Although such a two-tier approach, such as available in the USA and elsewhere, is politically dead on arrival in Canada today, private insurance being already legal and commonly available there. Interestingly, this recommended solution is utilized in most western European countries where there is a higher percentagea than in Canada of public (versus private) funding of their total health expenditures. Because of various vested interests, attempts to implement any of the aforementioned proposals will undoubtedly result in considerable political rancor. There is greater likelihood, however, that the Canadians because their need to be more effective and efficient in their delivery of care, and their overall long-term fiscal outlook will agree to the further privatization of their healthcare system before the Americans will mandate universal access, use the smart card to process insurance eligibility and claims or will impose price controls on high-tech services and on pharmaceuticals.

A total of 100 rats were divided into 4 groups based on the coronary ligation period: 30, 60, 120, and 180 min, and each group was further divided into 5 subgroups with different reperfusion periods: 0, 30, 60, 120, and 180 min. R0 was the baseline of each subgroup. All animals received the same protocols for designed ligation and reperfusion periods. Evans blue and 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride were used to distinguish different myocardial injury areas: area at risk (AAR) and myocardial necrosis. The differences of the ratios of the necrotic area to AAR between each subgroup and baseline were further averaged to calculate an overall value of each heart. The relative RI percentages showed significant differences (0.8 \u00b1 2.3%, 4.9 \u00b1 3.3%, 10.8 \u00b1 3.1%, and 20.3 \u00b1 3.6% respectively, p < 0.001) at different time points of reperfusion but not at different time points of ligation (p = 0.593). The effects of different time courses in RI showed that the L120R180 group (43.4 \u00b1 2.3%) had the highest RI difference with the baseline group. Maximal RI occurred at the timeframe of L120R180 in our animal model. This result may be utilized to assess the substantial benefits of RI therapies in an experimental rat model setting."}

However, there is no established predictive score to identify high-risk patients for HPC. Consecutive patients who were hospitalized (2008-2013) with non-penetrating moderate or severe TBI were studied. The primary outcome was HPC, defined by both a relative increase in contusion volume by \u226530 % and an absolute increase by \u226510 mL on serial imaging. Logistic regression models were created to identify independent risk factors for HPC. The HPC Score was then derived based on the final model. Among a total of 286 eligible patients, 61 (21 %) patients developed HPC. On univariate analyses, HPC was associated with older age, higher initial blood pressure, antiplatelet medications, anticoagulants, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) subdural hematoma (SDH), skull fracture, frontal contusion, larger contusion volume, and shorter interval from injury to initial CT. In the final model, SAH (OR 6.33, 95 % CI, 1.80-22.23), SDH (OR 3.46, 95 % CI, 1.39-8.63), and skull fracture (OR 2.67, 95 % CI, 1.28-5.58) were associated with HPC. Based on these factors, the HPC Score was derived (SAH = 2 points, SDH = 1 point, and skull fracture = 1 point). This score had an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.77. Patients with a score of 0-2 had a 4.0 % incidence of HPC, while patients with a score of 3-4 had a 34.6 % incidence of HPC. A simple HPC Score was developed for early risk stratification of HPC in patients with moderate or severe TBI."}

The experience of older women: A qualitative study In nursing homes, a number of barriers to the expression of sexuality exist, such as the lack of privacy, certain attitudes on behalf of the staff and the family, the lack of a sexual partner, and physical limitations. The aim of this study was to describe the lived experience of sexuality in elderly Spanish women residing in nursing homes. A qualitative phenomenological approach was followed. Data were collected over an 18- month period between 2013 and 2015. Purposeful sampling was conducted with Spanish residents in nursing homes in Madrid. Data were collected using unstructured and semi-structured interviews. The data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Twenty female residents participated. Three main themes emerged from the data: a) expressing sexuality, b) sexuality as a duty and c) respecting vows. Female residents reported key elements influencing how they manage their sexuality in Nursing Homes. These results serve to improve our understanding regarding the expression of sexuality in older female nursing home residents."}

The national youth service is usually characterized by a number of new challenges and experiences which may require life style adjustments by the corps member. However, no previous study on psychological factors has been conducted among corps members. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of depression, anxiety and, stress and their associated factors among corps members serving in Kebbi state. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 264 corps members from four local government areas of the state. Selection of the local government areas and the individual participants was by simple random sampling. Data was collected from May to June 2014 using a self-administered questionnaire. Data analysis used chi-square test to identify the relationship between categorical variables and multivariate logistic regression to identify the independent factors for depression, anxiety and stress each. The response rate was 97%. Most of the respondents were males (63.6%), single (85.5%), and above 20 years of age (71.6%). The overall prevalences of depression, anxiety and stress among the respondents were 36.4%, 54.5% and 18.2% respectively. The independent factors for depression were; being from the North central (OR = 5.99; 95% CI: 2.194-16.354) or South-south; and the perception of earning enough income (OR = 2.987; 95% CI: 1.062-8.400). For anxiety, male gender (OR = 0.411; 95% CI: 0.169-0.999); and being from the North central were significant risk factors (OR = 3.731; 95% CI: 1.450-9.599). Being above 26 years of age was an independent risk factor for stress (OR = 0.083; 95% CI: 0.018-0.381). Also, those who had ever schooled outside their towns of residence were less likely to be stressed compared to those who had never (OR = 0.30; 95% CI: 0.110-0.855). All other factors did not show any significant association with any of the outcome variables in multivariate analysis. In conclusion, the prevalences of depression, anxiety and stress are high among corps members serving in Kebbi state.

However, nothing is known about its effects on exercise capacity and underlying mechanisms in normal, sedentary subjects. Twenty normal, sedentary subjects (\u223c50 years old) were randomized to placebo or dark chocolate (DC) groups and consumed 20 g of the products for 3 months. Subjects underwent before and after treatment, bicycle ergometry to assess VO2 max and work, SkM biopsy to assess changes in mitochondrial density, function and oxidative stress and blood sampling to assess metabolic endpoints. Seventeen subjects completed the trial. In the DC group (n = 9), VO2 max increased (17% increase, p = 0.056) as well as maximum work (watts) achieved (p = 0.026) with no changes with placebo (n = 8). The DC group evidenced increases in HDL levels (p = 0.005) and decreased triglycerides (p = 0.07). With DC, SkM evidenced significant increases in protein levels for LKB1, AMPK and PGC1\u03b1 and in their active forms (phosphorylated AMPK and LKB1) as well as in citrate synthase activity while no changes were observed in mitochondrial density. With DC, significant increases in SkM reduced glutathione levels and decreases in protein carbonylation were observed. Improvements in maximum work achieved and VO2 max may be due to DC activation of upstream control systems and enhancement of SkM mitochondria efficiency. Larger clinical studies are warranted to confirm these observations."}

To reduce such errors, the following series of strategies were implemented: a restrictive specimen acceptance policy for the ED and IPD in 2006; a computer-assisted barcode positive patient identification system for the ED and IPD in 2007 and 2010, and automated sample labeling combined with electronic identification systems introduced to the OPD in 2009. Of the 2000345 specimens collected in 2005, 1023 (0.0511%) were identified as having patient identification errors, compared with 58 errors (0.0015%) among 3761238 specimens collected in 2014, after serial interventions; this represents a 97% relative reduction.

The objective of this study was to apply CREST to hospitalized patients with SSTIs in order to quantify disease severity and evaluate appropriateness of antibiotic management. This was a retrospective, hypothesis -generating, single-centre evaluation of hospitalized patients with SSTIs admitted in 2011. Based on CREST classification, the empirical antimicrobial choices were categorized as appropriate, over-treatment or under-treatment. A total of 369 patients were screened and 200 met the inclusion criteria. The majority of patients were classified as either CREST class I (n = 68) or class I I (n = 102). Over-treatment was more common in the less severe classes (88% and 32% in class I and class II, respectively; P < 0.05). Sixty-three percent of class I (n = 43) were over-treated due to both the use of intravenous antibiotic s when oral therapy was sufficient and use of unnecessarily broad-spectrum antibiotics. In contrast, 25% (n = 26) of class II were over-treated due to use of unnecessarily broad-spectrum antibiotics. Overall clinical failure rates remained low with only 1%, 4% and 17% of patients unable to achieve initial response in class II, class III and class IV. Retrospective application of CREST identified opportunities to improve the management of SSTIs.

However, clinical data focused on VSB in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT) recipients are lacking. The medical records of allo-HSCT recipients who received oral levofloxacin prophylaxis between January 2011 and August 2013 at Toranomon Hospital were reviewed to evaluate breakthrough VSB. Stored viridans streptococcal (VGS) species were identified by using sodA gene sequencing, and were assessed for drug susceptibility. Among the 184 allo-HSCT recipients on levofloxacin prophylaxis, 28 (15.2 %) experienced breakthrough VSB. All of the 28 recipients with VSB were treated with a cefepime - based or piperacillin/tazobactam - based regimen. The susceptibility rates of the VGS strains for levofloxacin, cefepime, piperacillin/tazobactam, meropenem, and vancomycin were 0 %, 95 %, 100 %, 100 %, and 100 %, respectively. Both the MIC50 (minimum inhibitory concentration) and the MIC90 of ceftazidim (0.5 \u03bcg/mL and 2 \u03bcg/mL, respectively) were higher than the MIC90 of all the other anti-pseudomonal beta-lactams (APBLs). Only 1 VGS strain had a penicillin MIC \u2265 2 \u03bcg/mL by the Etest (3.6 %). There were no cases with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that was associated with VSB, although the rate of viridans group streptococcal shock syndrome was high (26 %). The crude 30-day mortality rate in the VSB group (10.7 %) did not differ significantly from that in the BSI without VSB group (9.3 %) or non - BSI group (7.0 %) (P = 0.77). Also, VSB was not a risk factor for all-cause mortality up to 60 days following allo-HSCT (P = 0.43). APBL with increased anti-VGS activity (APBL-VA) monotherapy would typically be optimal for treating the VGS strains in this setting. Indication of adding an empiric anti-gram-positive agent to APBL-VA for treating VSB should depend on local factors, such as the susceptibility results. In addition, breakthrough VSB is probably not a major cause of death in allo-HSCT settings, where beta-lactam non-susceptible VGS and the ARDS are rare."}

In this paper we report the results of an experiment to determine the effect of inter-stimulus interval (ISI) and regularity on potentials recorded above and below VEMP threshold. Five healthy, right-handed subjects were recruited and evoked potentials were recorded to binaurally presented sound stimulation, above and below vestibular threshold, at seven stimulus rates with ISIs of 212, 300, 424, 600, 848, 1200 and 1696 ms. The inner five intervals, i.e. 300, 424, 600, 848, 1200 ms, were presented twice in both regular and irregular conditions. ANOVA on the global field power (GFP) were conducted for each of four waves, N42, P52, N1 and P2 with factors of intensity, ISI and regularity. Both N42 and P52 waves showed significant ANOVA effects of intensity but no other main effects or interactions. In contrast both N1 and P2 showed additional effects of ISI, as well as intensity, and evidence of non - linear interactions between ISI and intensity. A source analysis was carried out consistent with prior work suggesting that when above vestibular threshold, in addition to bilateral superior temporal cortex, ocular, cerebellar and cingulate sources are recruited. Further statistical analysis of the source currents indicated that the origin of the interactions with intensity may be the ISI sensitivity of the vestibular -dependent sources. This in turn may reflect a specific vestibular preference for stimulus rates associated with locomotion, i.e. rates close to 2 Hz, or ISIs close to 500 ms, where saccular afferents show increased gain and the corresponding reflexes are most sensitive."}

Expected benefits included fewer severe hypoglycemic episodes, reduced need for insulin, preventing onset/progression of complications and improved psychological well-being. These were realized for most, at least in the short term. Most interviewees described well-informed, shared decision-making with clinicians and family, and managing their expectations. Although life \"on the list\" could be stressful, and immunosuppressant side effects were severe, interviewees reported \" no regrets .\" Posttransplant, interviewees experienced increased confidence, through freedom from hypoglycemia and regained glycemic control, which tempered any disappointment about continued reliance on insulin. Most viewed their transplant as a success, though several reflected upon setbacks and hidden hopes for becoming \" insulin-free .\" Independently undertaken interviews demonstrated realistic and balanced expectations of IT and indicate how to optimize the process and support for future IT candidates."}

Nanomechanical experiments on cylindrical samples, with diameters between 250 nm and 3,000 nm, of the bone's ordered and disordered phases revealed a transition from plastic deformation to brittle failure and at least a factor-of-2 higher strength in the smaller samples. We postulate that this transition in failure mechanism is caused by the suppression of extrafibrillar shearing in the smaller samples, and that the emergent smaller -is- stronger size effect is related to the sample-size scaling of the distribution of flaws. Our findings should help in the understanding of the multi-scale nature of bone and provide insights into the biomineralization process."}

Currently the subject of many studies and discussion, the molecular assembly of the ion channel and the structural characteristics of the p7 monomer are not yet fully understood. Structural investigation of p7 has been carried out only in detergent environments, making the interpretation of the experimental results somewhat questionable. Here, we analyze by means of molecular dynamics simulations the structure of the p7 monomer as a function of its sequence, initial conformation and environment. We investigate the conductance properties of three models of a hexameric p7 ion channel by examining ion translocation in a pure lipid bilayer. It is noteworthy that although none of the models reflects the experimentally observed trend to conduct preferentially cations, we were able to identify the position and orientation of titratable acidic or basic residues playing a crucial role in ion selectivity and in the overall conductance of the channel. In addition, too compact a packing of the monomers leads to channel collapse rather than formation of a reasonable pore, amenable to ion translocation.

BarR is an Lrp -like transcription factor in the model archaeon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius that activates the expression of a \u03b2-alanine aminotransferase gene, which is involved in \u03b2-alanine degradation. In contrast to classical Lrp -like transcription factors, BarR is not responsive to any of the \u03b1-amino acids but interacts specifically with \u03b2-alanine. Besides the juxtaposed \u03b2-alanine aminotransferase gene, other regulatory targets of BarR have not yet been identified although \u03b2-alanine is the precursor of coenzyme A and thus an important central metabolite. The aim of this study is to extend the knowledge of the DNA-binding characteristics of BarR and of its corresponding regulon from a local to a genome -wide perspective. We characterized the genome-wide binding profile of BarR using chromatin immunoprecipation combined with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq). This revealed 21 genomic binding loci. High-enrichment binding regions were validated to interact with purified BarR protein in vitro using electrophoretic mobility shift assays and almost all targets were also shown to harbour a conserved semi-palindromic binding motif. Only a small subset of enriched genomic sites are located in intergenic regions at a relative short distance to a promoter, and qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated that only one additional operon is under activation of BarR, namely the glutamine synthase operon. The latter is also a target of other Lrp -like transcription factors. Detailed inspection of the BarR ChIP-seq profile at the \u03b2-alanine aminotransferase promoter region in combination with binding motif predictions indicate that the operator structure is more complicated than previously anticipated, consisting of multiple (major and auxiliary) operators. BarR has a limited regulon, and includes also glutamine synthase genes besides the previously characterized \u03b2-alanine aminotransferase. Regulation of glutamine synthase is suggestive of a link between \u03b2-alanine and \u03b1-amino acid metabolism in S. acidocaldarius. Furthermore, this work reveals that the BarR regulon overlaps with that of other Lrp -like regulators."}

Glycoside hydrolases (GH) are enzymes that mainly hydrolyze the glycosidic bond between two carbohydrates or a carbohydrate and a non-carbohydrate moiety. These enzymes are involved in many fundamental and diverse biological processes in plants. We have focused on the GH32 family, including enzymes very similar in both sequence and structure, each having however clear specificities of substrate preferences and kinetic properties. Structural and topological differences among proteins of the GH32 family have been here identified by means of an emerging approach (Protein Contact network, PCN) based on the formalization of 3D structures as contact networks among amino-acid residues. The PCN approach proved successful in both reconstructing the already known functional domains and in identifying the structural counterpart of the properties of GH32 enzymes, which remain uncertain, like their allosteric character. The main outcome of the study was the discovery of the activation upon binding of the border (cleft) region between the two domains. This reveals the allosteric nature of the enzymatic activity for all the analyzed forms in the GH32 family, a character yet to be highlighted in biochemical studies. Furthermore, we have been able to recognize a topological signature (graph energy) of the different affinity of the enzymes towards small and large substrates."}

Its etiology is not well understood, but it is increasingly believed to result from diverse pathophysiologies that affect the structure and function of specific brain circuits. Although one of the best-studied neurobiological abnormalities in ADHD is reduced fronto-striatal-cerebellar gray matter (GM) volume, its specific genetic correlates are largely unknown. In this study, T1-weighted MR images of brain structure were collected from 198 adolescents (63 ADHD - diagnosed). A multivariate parallel independent component analysis (Para-ICA) technique -identified imaging genetic relationships between regional GM volume and single nucleotide polymorphism data. Para-ICA analyses extracted 14 components from genetic data and 9 from MR data. An iterative cross-validation using randomly chosen subsamples indicated acceptable stability of these ICA solutions. A series of partial correlation analyses controlling for age, sex, and ethnicity revealed two genotype-phenotype component pairs significantly differed between ADHD and non-ADHD groups, after a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. The brain phenotype component not only included structures frequently found to have abnormally low volume in previous ADHD studies but was also significantly associated with ADHD differences in symptom severity and performance on cognitive tests frequently found to be impaired in patients diagnosed with the disorder. Pathway analysis of the genotype component identified several different biological pathways linked to these structural abnormalities in ADHD. Some of these pathways implicate well-known dopaminergic neurotransmission and neurodevelopment hypothesized to be abnormal in ADHD. Other more recently implicated pathways included glutamatergic and GABA-eric physiological systems; others might reflect sources of shared liability to disturbances commonly found in ADHD, such as sleep abnormalities."}

This slow-growing asymptomatic lesion typically develops along the gingival margin of the masticatory mucosa, followed by the hard palate, tongue, buccal mucosa, floor of the mouth, alveolar mucosa, soft palate and junction between the hard and soft palate. Moreover, this lesion can also affect the skin and genital organs. Clinically, VX generally presents a sessile or pedunculated appearance, forming a papule or single plaque with verrucous or papillomatous mucosal growth. The colour (white, pink, grey, or yellow) depends on the thickness of the overlying epidermis. In fact, the clinical findings of VX are similar to those of verrucous carcinoma and other benign tumours, such as squamous papilloma, verruca vulgaris and mucosal fibroma. For this reason, clinical and histopathological examinations are essential for accurate differential diagnosis. Histologically, VX is characterized by parakeratosis, rete ridges of uniform depth and the accumulation of foam cells, which are also called \" xanthoma cells \". Here, we describe the clinicopathological and immunohistochemical findings of a VX located on the lower gingiva of a 64-year-old male patient."}

Cumulative evidence suggests that changes in miRNA expression may in part underlie the pathophysiology and treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD). A miRNA expression assay that can simultaneously detect 423 rat miRNAs (miRBase v.17) was used to profile the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of a genetic rat model of MDD (the Flinders Sensitive Line [FSL]) and the controls, the Flinders Resistant Line (FRL). Gene expression data from the PFC of FSL / FRL animals (GEO accession no. GSE20388) were used to guide mRNA target selection. Luciferase reporter assays were used to verify miRNA targets in vitro. We identified 23 miRNAs that were downregulated in the PFC of the FSL model compared with controls. Interestingly, one of the identified miRNAs (miR-101b) is highly conserved between rat and human and was recently found to be downregulated in the PFC of depressed suicide subjects. Using a combination of in silico and in vitro analyses, we found that miR-101b targets the neuronal glutamate transporter SLC1A1 (also known as EAAC1 or EAAT3). Accordingly, both mRNA and protein levels of SLC1A1 were found to be upregulated in the PFC of the FSL model. Besides providing a list of novel miRNAs associated with depression-like states, this preclinical study replicated the human association of miR-101 with depression. In addition, since one of the targets of miR-101b appears to be a glutamate transporter, our preclinical data support the hypothesis of a glutamatergic dysregulation being implicated in the etiology of depression."}

We examined incidence of diabetes and obesity in a prospective cohort of those initiating ART in the Dominican Republic. Participants \u226518 years, initiating ART <90 days prior to study enrollment, were examined for incidence of impaired fasting glucose (IFG), diabetes mellitus (DM), overweight, and obesity. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 100-125mg/dl defined IFG; FPG \u2265126 mg/dl, diagnosis per medical record, or use of hypoglycemic medication defined DM. Overweight and obesity were BMI 25-30 and \u226530kg/m2, respectively. Dyslipidemia was total cholesterol \u2265240mg/dl or use of lipid-lowering medication. Framingham risk equation was used to determine ten-year CVD risk at the end of observation. Of 153 initiating ART, 8 (6%) had DM and 23 (16%) had IFG at baseline, 6 developed DM (28/1000 person - years follow up [PYFU]) and 46 developed IFG (329/1000 PYFU). At baseline, 24 (18%) were obese and 36 (27%) were overweight, 15 became obese (69/1000 PYFU) and 22 became overweight (163/1000 PYFU).

The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate experience with the laparoscopic approach of MWTA at our center. In a cohort of 35 consecutive patients undergoing MWTA with laparoscopic approach between January, 2013 and May, 2016, we reviewed the demographic data, the Barcelona clinic liver cancer stage, the severity of cirrhotic liver disease, the size of the ablated lesion, the duration of the procedure, and complications occurring within 90 days of surgery. MWTA was performed by applying one to three hepatic parenchymal insertions (mean 1.8) per patient. The mean duration of surgery was 163 \u00b1 18 minutes. There was no blood loss in any of the procedures. Complete necrosis on CT scan was achieved in 26/35 patients (75%).

With advancing disease, both motor and non-motor symptoms represent a considerable burden and symptom relief and quality of life improvement become the main goal of treatment. Botulinum toxins (BTX) are an effective treatment modality for many neurological conditions. To understand the potential usefulness of BTX in this population, we performed a retrospective chart review of all patients with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic PD and atypical parkinsonism who received treatment with BTX injections in our center from 1995 to 2014 for a variety of symptoms. Response to BTX was assessed using a subjective Clinical Global Impression. Records of 160 patients were reviewed. Probable idiopathic PD was the diagnosis in 117 patients (73.1%). The main indication for BTX treatment was pain (50.6% of cases). Other indications were the treatment of functional impairment resulting from dystonia (26.25%), sialorrhea (18.75%), freezing of gait, and camptocormia. Considering pain as indication, 81% of all patients with PD reported benefits after the first BTX injections. This benefit was maintained after the last recorded visit without significant difference in outcome compared with the first injection (p=0.067). Similar results were observed in patients with atypical parkinsonism. Our results confirm the safety and efficacy of different uses of BTX in the symptomatic treatment of patients with parkinsonism even in advanced stages of the disease, and suggest BTX treatment could have a safe and useful role in the treatment of pain in this population."}

However, the potential contribution of chronic antipsychotic medication exposure to these phenomena remains unclear. We examined the effect of chronic exposure (8 weeks) to clinically relevant doses of either haloperidol (HAL) or olanzapine (OLZ) on adult rat hippocampal volume and shape using ex vivo structural MRI with the brain retained inside the cranium to prevent distortions due to dissection, followed by tensor-based morphometry (TBM) and elastic surface-based shape deformation analysis. The volume of the hippocampus was also measured post-mortem from brain tissue sections in each group. Chronic exposure to either HAL or OLZ had no effect on the volume of the hippocampus, even at exploratory thresholds, which was confirmed post-mortem. In contrast, shape deformation analysis revealed that chronic HAL and OLZ exposure lead to both common and divergent shape deformations (q = 0.05, FDR-corrected) in the rat hippocampus. In particular, in the dorsal hippocampus, HAL exposure led to inward shape deformation, whereas OLZ exposure led to outward shape deformation. Interestingly, outward shape deformations that were common to both drugs occurred in the ventral hippocampus. These effects remained significant after controlling for hippocampal volume suggesting true shape changes. Chronic exposure to either HAL or OLZ leads to both common and divergent effects on rat hippocampal shape in the absence of volume change. The implications of these findings for the clinic are discussed."}

In the present study, four different screw -fixed interlocking systems for FINs (Hofer TwinPlug with two 3-mm titanium interlocking screws, Hofer FixPlug with 3-mm titanium interlocking screw, Hofer Plug with 3.5-mm titanium interlocking screw, and Hofer Plug with 3-mm titanium interlocking screw) in comparison with the commonly used Ender stainless steel nails (locked with 3.5-mm screw) were experimentally investigated in cadaveric lamb tibiae, regarding their load characteristics and failure modes in the case of heavy loading. The specimens were subjected to sequential axial cyclic loading of 5000 cycles with stepwise increase of the load amplitude until failure. Migration of locking screws and internal damage of bone tissue was quantified by micro-computed tomography (CT) imaging. Ender nails failed on average at a peak load of 800 N, TwinPlugs at 1367 N, FixPlugs at 1222 N, Plugs 3.5mm at 1225 N and Plugs 3.0mm at 971 N. TwinPlugs, FixPlugs, and Plugs 3.5mm failed in a slow manner over several hundred loading cycles, whereas Ender nails and Plugs 3.0mm exhibited abrupt failure without any prior indication. Our results confirm that axial stability of FIN can be further improved by screw -fixed plugs by simultaneously avoiding shortcomings of an eye-locked system, which the Ender nails are.

The wild type opsins did not produce responses, but cells expressing chimera mutants (WT Opn3s in which the third intracellular loops were replaced with the third intracellular loop of a Gs-coupled jellyfish opsin) displayed light - dependent changes in cAMP. The results suggest that Opn3 is capable of activating G protein(s) in a light - dependent manner. Finally, we used this assay to measure the relative wavelength - dependent response of cells expressing Opn3 chimeras to multiple quantally - matched stimuli. The inferred spectral sensitivity curve of zebrafish Opn3 accurately matched the measured absorption spectrum. We were unable to estimate the spectral sensitivity curve of mouse or anole Opn3, but, like zebrafish Opn3, the chicken and pufferfish Opn3-JiL3 chimeras also formed blue-sensitive pigments. These findings suggest that vertebrate Opn3s may form blue-sensitive G protein-coupled pigments. Further, we suggest that the method described here, combining a cAMP - dependent luciferase reporter assay with chimeric opsins possessing the third intracellular loop of jellyfish opsin, is a versatile approach for estimating absorption spectra of opsins with unknown signaling cascades or for which absorption spectra are difficult to obtain."}

Many foot care professionals recommend offloading measures as part of management strategies for modulating excess pressure to prevent development of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). These measures may include padding, insoles / orthotic devices and footwear. There is a lack of evidence -based guidance on the effectiveness of the different offloading options for preventing primary ulceration in those with diabetes. To identify, critically appraise and synthesize the best available evidence on methods of offloading to prevent the development, and reduce the risk, of primary foot ulceration in adults with diabetes .The question addressed by the review was: what is the effectiveness of methods of offloading in preventing primary DFUs in adults with diabetes? Adults 18 years and older with diabetes mellitus, regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, duration or type of diabetes, with no history of DFUs and in any clinical setting will be included. Interventions will include all external methods of offloading. All comparators will be considered. Studies that utilize interventions not considered usual practice in the prevention of DFUs will be excluded. The primary outcome will be primary foot ulceration. The secondary outcome will be indications of changes in plantar pressure. This review will consider all quantitative study designs. A three-step strategy for published and unpublished literature will be used. Fourteen databases will be searched for studies in English up to November 2013. The JBI-MAStARI extraction tool was used to extract relevant data. Results were summarized using narrative and tables. Three studies which examined the effectiveness of four different offloading interventions met the inclusion criteria. There is limited evidence that use of a footwear system (prototype shoe plus polyurethane or cork insole) may prevent a break in the skin; use of customized rigid orthotic devices may contribute to a reduction in the grade and number of calluses; and a manufactured shoe plus customized insole may reduce plantar pressure and therefore reduce the potential risk of skin ulceration. There is limited and low-quality evidence that in a population of adults with diabetes with no history of DFU, the use of footwear with customized or prefabricated orthotic devices may provide some reduction in plantar pressure and therefore help to prevent a primary DFU. There is a lack of evidence on the relative effectiveness of different offloading options."}

A comprehensive retrospective review of medical records was completed of all young people aged 10-18 years presenting to our Central London Emergency Department over a 12-month period. A subset of the total group was identified as the punch injury subgroup. A total of 78 punch injury presentations were identified. In this subgroup, the male: female ratio is 4.57:1; 37.18% of presentations were associated with a fracture (n = 29) and 35.90% (n = 28) of patients re-presented following another punch injury, as a victim of violence, or by other psychiatric presentation. In conclusion, a male preponderance was observed, with frequent re-presentations, often in high-risk circumstances. An opportunity for screening, including mental health, social and substance misuse, was identified. Further research is needed to enable targeted effective interventions in this group."}

So far, no in depth-study has been performed to systematically analyse the root causes of unplanned ICU-admissions. The primary aim of this study was to identify the healthcare worker -, organisational -, technical ,- disease - and patient - related causes that contribute to acute unplanned ICU admissions from general wards using a Root-Cause Analysis Tool called PRISMA-medical. Although a Track and Trigger System (MEWS) was introduced in our hospital a few years ago, it was implemented without a clear protocol. Therefore, the secondary aim was to assess the adherence to a Track and Trigger system to identify deterioration on general hospital wards in patients eventually transferred to the ICU. Retrospective observational study in 49 consecutive adult patients acutely admitted to the Intensive Care Unit from a general nursing ward. 1. PRISMA-analysis on root causes of unplanned ICU admissions 2. Assessment of protocol adherence to the early warning score system. Out of 49 cases, 156 root causes were identified. The most frequent root causes were healthcare worker related (46%), which were mainly failures in monitoring the patient. They were followed by disease -related (45%), patient -related causes (7, 5%), and organisational root causes (3%). In only 40% of the patients vital parameters were monitored as was instructed by the doctor. 477 vital parameter sets were found in the 48 hours before ICU admission, in only 1% a correct MEWS was explicitly documented in the record. This in-depth analysis demonstrates that almost half of the unplanned ICU admissions from the general ward had healthcare worker related root causes, mostly due to monitoring failures in clinically deteriorating patients. In order to reduce unplanned ICU admissions, improving the monitoring of patients is therefore warranted."}

Phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) inhibitors have been considered as therapeutic agents for schizophrenia because the regulation of cAMP and cGMP in the striatum by PDE10A plays an important role in the signaling mechanisms of the striatal-cortical network, and thereby in cognitive function. In the present study we assessed in non-human primates (NHPs) the effects of a novel PDE10A inhibitor (FRM-6308) that has demonstrated high potency and selectivity for human recombinant PDE10A in vitro. The behavioral effects of FRM-6308 in a dose range were determined in rhesus monkeys using a standardized motor disability scale for primates, motor tasks, and the \" drug effects on the nervous system\" (DENS) scale. The neuronal metabolic effects of FRM-6308 were determined with [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose PET imaging. Results showed that FRM-6308 did not have any specific effects on the motor system at s.c. doses up to 0.32 mg/kg in NHPs, which induced a significant increase in the FDG - SUV in striatum (F 16.069, p < 0.05) and cortical (F 15.181, p < 0.05) regions. Higher doses induced sedation and occasional involuntary movements with clear development of tolerance after repeated exposures. These findings suggest that FRM-6308 has the adequate pharmacological profile to advance testing in clinical trials and demonstrate antipsychotic efficacy of PDE10A inhibition for the treatment of schizophrenia patients."}

Even if the size of the nanoclusters is between 60 and 500 nm, due to their highly porous \"cauliflower\"-like structure, the porous silicon nanoparticles are composed of interconnected nanocrystals having around 2.5 nm in size and showing strong visible luminescence in the orange - red spectral region (centred at 600-700 nm). Hydrophilic behaviour and good solubility of the nanoclusters in water and water - based solutions were obtained by adding hydrogen peroxide into the etching solution during preparation and 16 min long after-bath in hydrogen peroxide. By simple filtration of the solutions with syringe filters, we have extracted smaller nanoclusters with sizes of approx. 60-70 nm; however, these nanoclusters in water and PBS solution (pH neutral) are prone to agglomeration, as was confirmed by zeta potential measurements. When the samples were left at ambient conditions for several weeks, the typical nanocluster size increased to approx. 330-400 nm and then remained stable. However, both freshly filtered and aged samples (with agglomerated porous silicon nanoparticles) of porous silicon in water and PBS solutions can be further used for biological studies or as luminescent markers in living cells."}

Most chiral amino acid separation techniques require complicated derivatization procedures in order to achieve the desirable chromatographic behavior and detectability. Thus, the aim of this research is to develop a highly sensitive analytical method for the enantioseparation of chiral amino acids without any derivatization process using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). By optimizing MS/MS parameters, we established a quantification method that allowed the simultaneous analysis of 18 d-amino acids with high sensitivity and reproducibility. Additionally, we applied the method to food sample (vinegar) for the validation, and successfully quantified trace levels of d-amino acids in samples. These results demonstrated the applicability and feasibility of the LC-MS/MS method as a novel, effective tool for d-amino acid measurement in various biological samples."}

The objective was to test the accuracy of Pd / Pa ratio registered during submaximal hyperaemia induced by non-ionic contrast medium (contrast FFR [cFFR]) in predicting FFR and comparing it to the performance of resting Pd / Pa in a collaborative registry of 926 patients enrolled in 10 hospitals from four European countries (Italy, Spain, France and Portugal). Resting Pd / Pa, cFFR and FFR were measured in 1,026 coronary stenoses functionally evaluated using commercially available pressure wires. cFFR was obtained after intracoronary injection of contrast medium, while FFR was measured after administration of adenosine. Resting Pd / Pa and cFFR were significantly higher than FFR (0.93\u00b10.05 vs. 0.87\u00b10.08 vs. 0.84\u00b10.08, p<0.001). A strong correlation and a close agreement at Bland-Altman analysis between cFFR and FFR were observed (r=0.90, p<0.001 and 95% CI of disagreement: from -0.042 to 0.11). ROC curve analysis showed an excellent accuracy (89%) of the cFFR cut-off of \u22640.85 in predicting an FFR value \u22640.80 (AUC 0.95 [95% CI: 0.94-0.96]), significantly better than that observed using resting Pd / Pa (AUC: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.88-0.91; p<0.001). A cFFR / FFR hybrid approach showed a significantly lower number of lesions requiring adenosine than a resting Pd / Pa / FFR hybrid approach (22% vs. 44%, p<0.0001). cFFR is accurate in predicting the functional significance of coronary stenosis. This could allow limiting the use of adenosine to obtain FFR to a minority of stenoses with considerable savings of time and costs."}

We prospectively enrolled 110 patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (NCT02162069). All procedures were performed without general anaesthesia by the transfemoral approach. Patients were followed for 30 days. Patients received the 23 mm (n=20), 25 mm (n=43) or 27 mm (n=47) Lotus device. Mean oversizing in relation to annulus or left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) did not differ among groups. There was no residual moderate or severe aortic regurgitation. The rate of mild aortic regurgitation was low at 9.1%. There was no valve embolisation, no need for a second valve and no conversion to surgery. The need for a new pacemaker implantation due to complete (third degree) or type II (Mobitz) second degree atrioventricular block was 24.1%, excluding patients with previously implanted devices. Within 30 days the rates of all-cause mortalit y and stroke were low. In patients with severe aortic stenosis, transfemoral TAVI with the repositionable Lotus valve was associated with a high rate of device success, no moderate or severe residual aortic regurgitation, low rates of major vascular complications and mortality within 30 days."}

As it inhibits the growth of a wide range of Gram-positive bacteria, including Listeria monocytogenes strains isolated from food, its potential for improving food safety was investigated in this study. Aureocin A70 (10,240AU/mL) proved to be bactericidal, but not extensively lytic, against listerial strains. The antibacterial activity of aureocin A70 (16AU/mL) was then tested in UHT-treated skimmed milk inoculated with the food -associated L. monocytogenes L12 strain (4-log CFU/mL) during storage at 4\u00b0C for one week. Aureocin A70 caused a time-dependent reduction in the listerial viable cell counts (5.51-log units) up to 7days of incubation. Aureocin A70 was neither toxic to the Vero and the L-929 cell lines nor exhibited a hemolytic activity against sheep red blood cells. Aureocin A70 proved to be completely stable for one month at 25\u00b0C, 16weeks at 4\u00b0C and 20weeks at -20\u00b0C. Aureocin A70 exhibited a time-dependent susceptibility to simulated gastric juice and bile salts mimicking gastrointestinal conditions. The entrapment of aureocin A70 in an alginate / gelatin matrix revealed that this bacteriocin can be released from this matrix. Moreover, it remained adsorbed to and active on a low-density polyethylene plastic surface suggesting that aureocin A70 may be employed in bioactive packaging to control the growth of undesirable bacteria. Taken together these results suggest that aureocin A70 is a promising alternative to be used in food applications."}

However, few studies focused on how to increase the efficiency of gene delivery to brain tumors after the released gene penetrating the BBB. Here, we proposed the use of folate - conjugated DNA - loaded cationic MBs (FCMBs). When combined with FUS as a trigger for BBB opening, FCMBs were converted into nanometer - sized vesicles that were transported to the brain parenchyma. The FCMBs can selectively aggregate around tumor cells that overexpressed the folate receptor, thus enhancing gene delivery via folate - stimulated endocytosis. Our results confirmed that FCMBs can carry DNA on the surface of the MB shell and have good targeting ability on C6 glioma cells. In addition, the optimized FUS parameters for FCMBs - enhanced gene delivery were confirmed by cell experiments (center frequency = 1 MHz; acoustic pressure = 700 kPa; pulse repetition frequency = 5 Hz; cycle number = 10000; exposure time = 1 min; FCMBs concentration = 4 \u00d7 10(7) MB/mL). In vivo data also indicated that FCMBs show better gene transfection efficiency than MBs without folate conjugation and the traditional approach of directly injecting the gene.

We previously reported association between younger age at onset of RA and a RANKL promoter SNP that conferred an elevated promoter activity via binding to a transcription factor SOX5. Here we study the regulation of SOX5 levels in relation to RANKL expression in RA synovial fibroblasts (SF) and the development of bone erosion in the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse. Our data indicated SOX5 levels were higher in synovium and synovial fluid from RA compared to osteoarthritis patients. Pro-inflammatory cytokines upregulated SOX5 and RANKL expression in both primary RA SF and the rheumatoid synovial fibroblast cell line, MH7A. Overexpression of SOX5 resulted in significantly increased RANKL levels, while knockdown of SOX5 resulted in diminished IL-6 mediated RANKL upregulation in MH7A cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) showed approximately 3-fold enrichment of RANKL-specific DNA in anti-SOX5 immunoprecipitate in IL-6 treated MH7A cells as compared to untreated cells. Locally silencing SOX5 gene significantly diminished RANKL positive cells and bone erosion in CIA mice.

The rates of postoperative endophthalmitis before April 2010 (Group 1, no intracameral cefuroxime) and after April 2010 (Group 2, routine use of intracameral cefuroxime) were compared. A total of 30,428 eyes (7,332 in Group 1 and 23,096 in Group 2) were studied. Eight cases developed postoperative endophthalmitis (1.09 in 1000; 0.11 %) in Group 1 whereas no cases developed endophthalmitis (0 %) in Group 2. The rate of reduction was statistically significant (p < 0.0001). Seven out of eight cases of endophthalmitis were confirmed by positive culture. Organisms identified were Group G Streptococcus (two cases), Group B Streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, Serratia marcescens, and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (two cases). Antibiotic susceptibility testing results were available in six cases. Four out of six organisms were susceptible to the penicillin group. No adverse events related to the use of intracameral cefuroxime were encountered. The use of intracameral cefuroxime could significantly reduce the rate of postoperative endophthalmitis in a tertiary centre in Hong Kong.

Through direct consumption of contaminated nectar and pollen from treated plants, neonicotinoids can affect foraging, learning, and memory in worker bees. Less well studied are the potential effects of neonicotinoids on queen bees, which may be exposed indirectly through trophallaxis, or food - sharing. To assess effects on queen productivity, small colonies of different sizes (1500, 3000, and 7000 bees) were fed imidacloprid (0, 10, 20, 50, and 100 ppb) in syrup for three weeks. We found adverse effects of imidacloprid on queens (egg-laying and locomotor activity), worker bees (foraging and hygienic activities), and colony development (brood production and pollen stores) in all treated colonies. Some effects were less evident as colony size increased, suggesting that larger colony populations may act as a buffer to pesticide exposure. This study is the first to show adverse effects of imidacloprid on queen bee fecundity and behavior and improves our understanding of how neonicotinoids may impair short-term colony functioning. These data indicate that risk-mitigation efforts should focus on reducing neonicotinoid exposure in the early spring when colonies are smallest and queens are most vulnerable to exposure."}

Residues from these environmental remediations are potential hazardous materials. Unfortunately, human health risks of BiOCls are still unexplored widely. In the present study, we focused on the influence of physicochemical properties on the cytotoxicity of BiOCls toward a human skin derived cell line (HaCaT). Results showed that morphology and surface hydroxyl both had a profound effect on the toxicity of BiOCls. Microsphere-shaped BiOCl caused less toxicity than nanosheet-shaped BiOCl because of weaker particle-membrane interactions, while the presence of surface hydroxyl on microsphere-shaped BiOCl significantly raised the toxicity owing to the increased interaction with cell membrane. Both microsphere-shaped BiOCl with surface hydroxyl and nanosheet-shaped BiOCl caused significant cell membrane damage (PI uptake and LDH release), however, based on the different mechanism. The former may be a predominant \"chemical\" mechanism involved an oxidative stress paradigm, as manifested by elevated ROS and depleted GSH, while the latter is mainly due to a direct \" physical \" damage to cell membrane. Both \" physical \" and \"chemical\" response led to cell death. Furthermore, a set of experiments including MMP collapse, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis / necrosis were conducted to propose a scenario for toxicological aspects of BiOCls.

This study combined invasive catheterisation with echocardiography to assess RV afterload, RV function and ventricular - vascular coupling in subjects with PAH. Twenty-six subjects with PAH were prospectively recruited to undergo right heart catheterisation and Doppler echocardiography at rest and during incremental exercise, and cardiac MRI at rest. Measurements at rest included basic haemodynamics, RV function and coupling efficiency (\u03b7). Measurements during incremental exercise included pulmonary vascular resistance (Z0), characteristic impedance (ZC, a measure of proximal PA stiffness) and proximal and distal PA compliance (CPA). In patients with PAH, the proximal PAs were significantly stiffer at maximum exercise (ZC =2.31\u00b10.38 vs 1.33\u00b10.15 WU\u00d7m(2) at rest; p=0.003) and PA compliance was decreased (CPA =0.88\u00b10.10 vs 1.32\u00b10.17 mL/mm Hg/m(2) at rest; p=0.0002). Z0 did not change with exercise. As a result, the resistance-compliance (RC) time decreased with exercise (0.67\u00b10.05 vs 1.00\u00b10.07 s at rest; p<10(-6)). When patients were grouped according to resting coupling efficiency, those with poorer \u03b7 exhibited stiffer proximal PAs at rest, a lower maximum exercise level, and more limited CPA reduction at maximum exercise. In PAH, exercise causes proximal and distal PA stiffening, which combined with preserved Z0 results in decreased RC time with exercise. Stiff PAs at rest may also contribute to poor haemodynamic coupling, reflecting reduced pulmonary vascular reserve that contributes to limit the maximum exercise level tolerated."}

Multidrug resistance mediated by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) overexpression has been previously associated with treatment failure and progression of OS, although other mechanisms may also play a role. We considered the typical acidic extracellular pH (pHe) of sarcomas, and found that doxorubicin (DXR) cytotoxicity is reduced in P-gp negative OS cells cultured at pHe 6.5 compared to standard 7.4. Short-time (24-48 hours) exposure to low pHe significantly increased the number and acidity of lysosomes, and the combination of DXR with omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor targeting lysosomal acidity, significantly enhanced DXR cytotoxicity. In OS xenografts, the combination treatment of DXR and omeprazole significantly reduced tumor volume and body weight loss. The impaired toxicity of DXR at low pHe was not associated with increased autophagy or lysosomal acidification, but rather, as shown by SNARF staining, with a reversal of the pH gradient at the plasma membrane (\u0394pHcm), eventually leading to a reduced DXR intracellular accumulation. Finally, the reversal of \u0394pHcm in OS cells promoted resistance not only to DXR, but also to cisplatin and methotrexate, and, to a lesser extent, to vincristine. Altogether, our findings show that, in OS cells, short-term acidosis induces resistance to different chemotherapeutic drugs by a reversal of \u0394pHcm, suggesting that buffer therapies or regimens including proton pump inhibitors in combination to low concentrations of conventional anticancer agents may offer novel solutions to overcome drug resistance."}

All patients undergoing B-KPro surgery between October 2008 and December 2009 by a single experienced surgeon at the Centre Hospitalier de l'Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al using an allograft carrier were considered. Patients were excluded if they had previously undergone B-KPro implantation. Participants were randomized individually to receive a B-KPro using a frozen or a fresh corneal graft carrier on the basis of tissue availability on the day of surgery, as determined by the local eye bank. The primary outcome measure was device retention at 24 and 60 months. Secondary outcome measures included surgical feasibility, visual acuity (VA), and complications. Thirty-seven eyes of 37 patients were enrolled in the initial study protocol, with 19 eyes randomized to fresh and 18 to frozen carrier grafts. Thirty-six eyes were followed through to 24 months, with 1 lost to follow-up. Of these, 26 were enrolled in the extension (11 eyes with a frozen and 15 eyes with a fresh carrier graft). There were no differences in the baseline characteristics of patients enrolled in the extension phase versus those who were not. At 60 months, median corrected distance VA) in the fresh group had improved to 20/150 from a baseline of counting fingers, whereas the frozen group improved to 20/400 from a baseline of hand motions. Device retention was 100% at 24 months and 96% at 60 months. There were no significant differences in the rate of complications between groups. Fresh and frozen corneal donors offer similar clinical outcomes when used as carriers for the B-KPro, with no significant differences in device retention, visual rehabilitation, or rates of complications at 24 or 60 months."}

Intervention study evaluating antibiotic prescribing following educational sessions for urinary tract infection, skin and soft tissue infection, pharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, acute otitis media, and acute bacterial sinusitis. A total of 26 out of 43 (60%) nurse practitioners in 4 urgent care centers were enrolled in the study. The rate of inappropriate antibiotic use among all conditions was 10% before and 8% after the intervention (p = .02). A decrease in inappropriate antibiotic prescribing was seen after the educational session (p < .01). The most common reasons for inappropriate antibiotic prescribing were too broad (41%), wrong dosage (22%), and not indicated (17%). Educational sessions led to improvement in overall inappropriate antibiotic use. Additional stewardship interventions are needed to further reduce unnecessary antibiotic use."}

Here, we describe the derivation and characterization, including single-cell RNA-seq, of neocortical and spinal cord neuroepithelial stem (NES) cells to model early human neurodevelopment and ZIKV -related neuropathogenesis. By analyzing human NES cells, organotypic fetal brain slices, and a ZIKV - infected micrencephalic brain, we show that ZIKV infects both neocortical and spinal NES cells as well as their fetal homolog, radial glial cells (RGCs), causing disrupted mitoses, supernumerary centrosomes, structural disorganization, and cell death. ZIKV infection of NES cells and RGCs causes centrosomal depletion and mitochondrial sequestration of phospho-TBK1 during mitosis. We also found that nucleoside analogs inhibit ZIKV replication in NES cells, protecting them from ZIKV - induced pTBK1 relocalization and cell death. We established a model system of human neural stem cells to reveal cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental defects associated with ZIKV infection and its potential treatment."}

There was a high prevalence of HPV infection both for in situ (95%) or invasive (94.83%) adenocarcinomas, comprising also cancers of unusual morphology. HPV 16 was the commonest strain (N=57, 73.08%) followed by HPV 18 (N=28, 35.90%). Interestingly, 13 cases (16.67%) were also HPV 52 positive (as co-infection with HPV 16 or 18). All other strains with the exception of HPV 66 were found only as co-infections. No significant age difference was noted in terms of any HPV strain positivity. HPV DNA was found in the large majority of cervical adenocarcinomas. As opposed to other studies, HPV 52 was the third most commonly encountered strain after HPV 16 and HPV 18. The above findings would probably be of help in decision making concerning vaccination policy for the prevention of HPV infection in Greece."}

In order to gain better understanding of this new approach, we performed dynamic in vivo CESL MRI on healthy rat brains with an intravenous injection of 2DG under various conditions at 9.4T. For three 2DG doses of 0.25, 0.5 and 1g/kg, we found that 2DG - CESL signals increased linearly with injection dose at the initial (<20min) but not the later period (>40min) suggesting time-dependent differential weightings of 2DG transport and metabolism. Remaining 2DG - CESL studies were performed with 0.25g/kg 2DG. Since a higher isoflurane level reduces glucose metabolism and increases blood flow, 2DG - CESL was measured under 0.5%, 1.5% and 2.2% isoflurane. The 2DG - CESL signal was reduced at higher isoflurane levels correlating well with the 2DG phosphorylation in the intracellular space. To detect regional heterogeneities of glucose metabolism, 2DG - CESL with 0.33\u00d70.33\u00d71.50mm(3) resolution was obtained, which indeed showed a higher response in the cortex compared to the corpus callosum. Lastly, unlike CESL MRI with the injection of non-transportable mannitol, the 2DG - CESL response decreased with an increased spin-lock pulse power confirming that 2DG - CESL is dominated by chemical exchange processes in the extravascular space. Taken together, our results showed that 2DG - CESL MRI signals mainly indicate glucose transport and metabolism and may be a useful biomarker for metabolic studies of normal and diseased brains."}

It also examined the longitudinal relation between agency and children's externalizing, internalizing, and school achievement. Swedish children's mothers and fathers (N = 103) were interviewed at three time points (when children were 8, 9, and 10 years old) about their warmth towards their children, children's agency, and children's externalizing and internalizing behaviors and school achievement. Parental warmth at Time 1 was significantly correlated with child agency at Time 2, which was significantly correlated with child externalizing and internalizing behaviors and academic achievement at Time 3. There were no differences between girls and boys. Results from this study indicate that Swedish parents' warmth is directly related to subsequent perceptions of children's agency, which in turn are related to subsequently lower child externalizing and internalizing problems and higher academic achievement. These findings held in the context of a three- year longitudinal study and for both boys and girls, suggesting the importance of child agency in the link between parental warmth and children's adjustment."}

In the liver, AVP is involved in ureogenesis, glycogenolysis, neoglucogenesis and regeneration. No data exist about the presence of AVP in the biliary epithelium. Cholangiocytes are the target cells in a number of animal models of cholestasis, including bile duct ligation (BDL), and in several human pathologies, such as polycystic liver disease characterized by the presence of cysts that bud from the biliary epithelium. In vivo, liver fragments from normal and BDL mice and rats as well as liver samples from normal and ADPKD patients were collected to evaluate: (i) intrahepatic bile duct mass by immunohistochemistry for cytokeratin-19; and (ii) expression of V1a, V1b and V2 by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and real-time PCR. In vitro, small and large mouse cholangiocytes, H69 (non-malignant human cholangiocytes) and LCDE (human cholangiocytes from the cystic epithelium) were stimulated with vasopressin in the absence/ presence of AVP antagonists such as OPC-31260 and Tolvaptan, before assessing cellular growth by MTT assay and cAMP levels. Cholangiocytes express V2 receptor that was upregulated following BDL and in ADPKD liver samples. Administration of AVP increased proliferation and cAMP levels of small cholangiocytes and LCDE cells. We found no effect in the proliferation of large mouse cholangiocytes and H69 cells. Increases were blocked by preincubation with the AVP antagonists. These results showed that AVP and its receptors may be important in the modulation of the proliferation rate of the biliary epithelium."}

In this observational cross-sectional study, two masked operators measured CCT thickness twice in 28 healthy eyes. We used seven spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) devices, one time-domain OCT, one Scheimpflug camera, and one US-based instrument. Inter- and intra-operator reproducibility was evaluated by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), coefficient of variation (CV), and Bland-Altman test analysis. Instrument -to- instrument reproducibility was determined by ANOVA for repeated measurements. We also tested how the devices disagreed regarding systemic bias and random error using a structural equation model. Mean CCT of all instruments ranged from 536 \u00b1 42 \u03bcm to 577 \u00b1 40 \u03bcm. An instrument -to- instrument correlation test showed high values among the 10 investigated devices (correlation coefficient range 0.852-0.995; p values <0.0001 in all cases). The highest correlation coefficient values were registered between 3D OCT-2000 Topcon-Spectral OCT/SLO Opko (0.995) and Cirrus HD-OCT Zeiss-RS-3000 Nidek (0.995), whereas the lowest were seen between SS-1000 CASIA and Spectral OCT/SLO Opko (0.852). ICC and CV showed excellent inter- and intra-operator reproducibility for all optic -based devices, except for the US -based device. Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated low mean biases between operators. Despite highlighting good intra- and inter-operator reproducibility, we found that a scale bias between instruments might interfere with thorough CCT monitoring.

We performed a retrospective single-institution analysis of patients with brain metastasis treated with upfront SRS without WBRT. Competing risks analysis was performed to estimate the subdistribution hazard ratios (HRs) for neurologic and nonneurologic death for predictor variables of interest. Of 738 patients treated with upfront SRS alone, neurologic death occurred in 226 (30.6%), while nonneurologic death occurred in 309 (41.9%). Multivariate competing risks analysis identified an increased hazard of neurologic death associated with diagnosis-specific graded prognostic assessment (DS-GPA) \u2264 2 (P = .005), melanoma histology (P = .009), and increased number of brain metastases (P<.001), while there was a decreased hazard associated with higher SRS dose (P = .004). Targeted agents were associated with a decreased HR of neurologic death in the first 1.5 years (P = .04) but not afterwards. An increased hazard of nonneurologic death was seen with increasing age (P =.03), nonmelanoma histology (P<.001), presence of extracranial disease (P<.001), and progressive systemic disease (P =.004). Melanoma, DS-GPA, number of brain metastases, and SRS dose are predictive of neurologic death, while age, nonmelanoma histology, and more advanced systemic disease are predictive of nonneurologic death.

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, we compare the bacterial communities of sixteen Atlantic hydrothermal vent samples with our own and publicly available global open ocean samples. Analysing sequences obtained from 63 million 16S rRNA genes, the genera we could identify in the open ocean waters contained 99.9% of the vent reads. This suggests that previously observed vent exclusiveness is, in most cases, probably an artefact of lower sequencing depth. These findings are a further step towards elucidating the role of the open ocean as a seed bank.

This study consists of a case series of 56 patients diagnosed with cerebral toxoplasmosis whose clinical features, brain imaging and cerebrospinal fluid aspects were analyzed. Cerebral toxoplasmosis led to the diagnosis of infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in 27 (48.2%) of the patients, while 29 (51.2%) others already knew to be HIV seropositive. However, at the time of diagnosis of cerebral toxoplasmosis, only 9 (16.6%) reported being under antiretroviral therapy and 5 (8.9%) were receiving primary prophylaxis for toxoplasmosis. Headache, strength deficit and fever were the most frequent signs and symptoms throughout the study. Fifty-three patients showed changes consistent with toxoplasmosis in CT or MRI. Thirty-four (60.7%) CSF samples were positive in the indirect haemagglutination test and for the reaction of Toxoplasma gondii IgG ELISA, while 31 (55.4%) were positive in the direct haemagglutination test. Fifty (89.3%) patients underwent first-line treatment for toxoplasmosis. Cerebral toxoplasmosis is still a very relevant neurological disease in individuals with AIDS admitted to neurology emergency departments.

Maf1 from yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae mediates repression of trna transcription when cells are transferred from medium with glucose to medium with glycerol, a non-fermentable carbon source. The strain with deleted gene encoding Maf1 (maf1\u0394) is viable but accumulates tRNA precursors. In this study tRNA precursors were analysed by RNA-Seq and Northern hybridization in wild type strain and maf1\u0394 mutant grown in glucose medium or upon shift to repressive conditions. A negative effect of maf1\u0394 mutant on the addition of the auxiliary CCA nucleotides to the 3' end of pre-tRNAs was observed in cells shifted to unfavourable growth conditions. This effect was reduced by overexpression of the yeast CCA1 gene encoding ATP(CTP):tRNA nucleotidyltransferase. The CCA sequence at the 3' end is important for export of tRNA precursors from the nucleus and essential for tRNA charging with amino acids. Data presented here indicate that CCA-addition to intron -containing end-processed tRNA precursors is a limiting step in tRNA maturation when there is no Maf1 mediated RNA polymerase III (Pol III) repression. The correlation between CCA synthesis and Pol III regulation by Maf1 could be important in coordination of tRNA transcription, processing and regulation of translation."}

The aims of this study were to record the PERL found incidentally during blunt renal trauma, to specify the place for effective conservative management and to determin the estimated partial permanent disability (PPD). The medical records of 14 patients with PERL and blunt renal trauma were reviewed. In each patient, pre-existing renal abnormalities, clinical symptoms, CT scan study findings, associated injuries, therapeutic approach, the accountability criteria and the estimated PPD were recorded. There were 11 men and 3 women with a mean age of 35,6 years (range 19-66 years). Renal trauma was due to a traffic accident in 8 patients. Renal damage appeared to be disproportionate to the severity of the trauma (minor trauma). They had a lower rate of associated trauma to other abdominal organs (four patients only). Urinary stones were present in 5 patients, pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction in 3, horseshoe kidny in 3, ectopic kidney in 2 and upper urinary tract carcinoma in one case. Early nephrectomy was required in three cases for hemodynamic instability. Ureteral stenting was indicated in 3 cases. Six patients were operated later because of their underlying renal pathology. A conservative treatment was possible only in 7 of cases. The PPD related to renal trauma varide from 0 to 13% in all cases. PERL may complicate a negligible renal trauma while in some cases they may be of vital importance for the patient's final outcome. The imaging findings are crucial but may be confusing. The therapeutic approach is, to a large extent, dependent on the type of PERL and the severity of damage, and is often conservative in the hemo-dynamically stable patient. Accountability link may be difficult to establish and the PPD depends on the PERL and the renal injuries severity. We have no involvement with funding in this case.

To overcome this obstacle, we compiled multiple chemistry-based strategies into the manufacture of the gene delivery formulations to pursue improved tolerability of DNA to the enzymatic degradation in the biological milieu and prolonged retention in the systemic circulation. Here, we constructed a distinctive multilayered functional architecture: plasmid DNA (pDNA) was electrostatically complexed with cationic poly(lysine) (polyplex) as the interior pDNA reservoir, which was further cross-linked by redox - responsive disulfide cross-linking to minimize the occurrence of polyplex disassembly through exchange reaction with the biological charged components. Still, the pDNA reservoir was spatially protected by a sequential thermoresponsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) palisade as the intermediate barrier and a biocompatible hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) shell with the aim of preventing the accessibility of the biological species, particularly the nuclease degradation to the pDNA payload. Subsequent investigations validated the utilities of these strategies in accomplishing prolonged blood retention. In an attempt to apply this method for tumor therapy, ligand cyclic (Arg-Gly-Asp) peptide was attached at the distal end of PEG, validating prompted tumor - targeted delivery and gene expression of the loaded antiangiogenic gene at the targeted tumor cells and accordingly exerting antiangiogenesis of the tumors for abrogation of tumor growth. Together with its excellent safe profile, the proposed formulation suggests potential utility as a practical gene delivery system for treatment of intractable diseases."}

Disruption of these domains after injury impairs nervous system function. Traditionally, injured CNS axons are considered refractory to regeneration, but some recent approaches challenge this view by showing robust long-distance regeneration. However, whether these approaches allow remyelination and promote the reestablishment of AIS and nodes of Ranvier is unknown. Using mouse optic nerve crush as a model for CNS traumatic injury, we performed a detailed analysis of AIS and node disruption after nerve crush. We found significant disruption of AIS and loss of nodes within days of the crush, and complete loss of nodes 1 week after injury. Genetic deletion of the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten) in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), coupled with stimulation of RGCs by inflammation and cAMP, dramatically enhanced regeneration. With this treatmen t, we found significant reestablishment of RGC AIS, remyelination, and even reassembly of nodes in regions proximal, within, and distal to the crush site. Remyelination began near the retina, progressed distally, and was confirmed by electron microscopy. Although axons grew rapidly, remyelination and nodal ion channel clustering was much slower. Finally, genetic deletion of ankyrinG from RGCs to block AIS reassembly did not affect axon regeneration, indicating that preservation of neuronal polarity is not required for axon regeneration. Together, our results demonstrate, for the first time, that regenerating CNS axons can be remyelinated and reassemble new AIS and nodes of Ranvier. We show, for the first time, that regenerated CNS axons have the capacity to both remyelinate and reassemble the axon initial segments and nodes of Ranvier necessary for rapid and efficient action potential propagation."}

Infliximab pharmacokinetics is variable between patients, but influence of the underlying disease was never assessed. This study aimed at assessing this influence using a cohort of patients monitored in a single center and with the same assay. Infliximab trough concentrations were determined on samples collected between weeks 0 and 22 after treatment initiation in 218 patients treated for RA, PsA, AS, CD or UC. Infliximab pharmacokinetics was analyzed by a one-compartment population model with first-order elimination rate constant. In AS patients, volume of distribution (V) and elimination clearance (CL) were 5.4 L and 0.24 L/day, respectively. In CD and UC patients, V was 49% and 52% higher than in AS, respectively, and CL was 47% and 60% higher than in AS, respectively. In RA patients, CL was 49% higher than in AS patients. Simulations showed that without methotrexate, a 3 mg/kg dosing regimen would lead only 16% of RA patients to reach the target concentration (2.5 mg/L) at week 22, whereas target concentrations would be reached in approximately half of RA patients cotreated with methotrexate, as well as half of CD (3.5 mg/L) and UC (3.7 mg/L) patients.

The aim of this study was to assess the performance of a biomarker panel to identify active LN in two international JSLE cohorts. Novel urinary biomarkers, namely vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), lipocalin-like prostaglandin D synthase (LPGDS), transferrin (TF), ceruloplasmin, alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), were quantified in a cross-sectional study that included participants of the UK JSLE Cohort Study (Cohort 1) and validated within the Einstein Lupus Cohort (Cohort 2). Binary logistic regression modelling and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis [area under the curve (AUC)] were used to identify and assess combinations of biomarkers for diagnostic accuracy. A total of 91 JSLE patients were recruited across both cohorts, of whom 31 (34 %) had active LN and 60 (66 %) had no LN. Urinary AGP, ceruloplasmin, VCAM-1, MCP-1 and LPGDS levels were significantly higher in those patients with active LN than in non - LN patients [all corrected p values (p c) < 0.05] across both cohorts. Urinary TF also differed between patient groups in Cohort 2 (p c = 0.001). Within Cohort 1, the optimal biomarker panel included AGP, ceruloplasmin, LPGDS and TF (AUC 0.920 for active LN identification). These results were validated in Cohort 2, with the same markers resulting in the optimal urine biomarker panel (AUC 0.991).

Clones of reputed cultivars would presumably be more accepted but little is known on the intra-cultivar genetic variability of the WUE. The present work compares, on the basis of two field assays, the variability of intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi) in a large collection of cultivars in contrast with a collection of clones of Tempranillo cultivar. The results show that clonal variability of WUEi was around 80% of the inter-cultivar, thus providing a first assessment on the opportunity for clonal selection by WUE. Plotting the WUEi data against stem water potential or stomatal conductance it was possible to identify cultivars and clones out of the confidence intervals of this linear regression thus with significantly higher and lower WUEi values. The present results contribute to open the expectative for a genetic improvement of grapevine WUE."}

Serva collagenase NB grades are formulated collagenases that are suitable for various tissue isolation applications. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) can improve the viability of human hepatocytes. The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of two collagenases and effect of NAC on hepatocyte isolation from porcine liver tissue. Porcine hepatocytes were isolated using the perfusion method from Bama mini pigs assigned to the Serva NB 4 group (n=6), the Serva NB 8 group (n=6), or the NB 8 + NAC group (n=6). Viability and yield were defined as fresh hepatocytes and their spheroids formation after 24-hour rocker culture in serum-free medium. Metabolic function was assessed by gene expression, albumin, and urea synthesis. All procedures resulted in successful hepatocyte isolation. Cells from the NB 8 + NAC group had (97.8\u00b11.9)% viability, which was higher than the NB 8 group with (94.4\u00b12.4)% and the NB 4 group with (94.5\u00b13.2)% (P<.001). The final cell yield reached (11.8\u00b11.0)\u00d710(9) cells in the NB 8 + NAC group, compared to (9.5\u00b12.1)\u00d710(9) cells in the NB 8 group (P<.01) and (9.1\u00b11.1) \u00d710(9) cells in the NB 4 group (P<.001). The secretion of albumin was superior in the NB 8 + NAC group at a concentration of (425.8\u00b135.3) ng/mL compared to the NB 8 group (339.1\u00b132.6) ng/mL (P <.001) and NB 4 group (293.6\u00b143.3) ng/mL (P <.01). The injury of hepatocytes also decreased in the NB 8 + NAC group (P<.01). The data are presented as means \u00b1 SD.

We compared 378 (3.4%) out of 11252 patients (group A) who had undergone 724 endovenous ablation of the saphenous veins from January 1, 2011 to September 30, 2014 while on oral anticoagulation to a randomly selected 375 patients (group B) who underwent 641 endovenous ablation in the same time period but were not on anticoagulation. The demographic data, history of DVT, the Clinical, Etiologic, Anatomic, Pathologic (CEAP) classification and the VCSS (Venous Clinical Severity Score) scores were analyzed. The indications for anticoagulation, the anticoagulants used were recorded. The primary endpoints were bleeding, development of DVT or EHIT, and failure of ablation. Patients in group A were older, had more men, more history of DVT and PE, had higher CEAP and VCSS scores compared to group B. The type of anticoagulation used was warfarin in 77.2% direct oral inhibitors (DOIs) in 22.8%. The rate of failure of ablation at 3 days was 39 (5.6%) for Group A and 3 (0.5%) for Group B (P<0.0001) and at one month it was 46 (10.1%) vs. 27 (6.7%) (P=0.086). The number of EHIT cases in group A at 3 days was 2 (0.3%), compared to 6 (0.9%) in group B (P=0.016) and at 1 month it was 0 compared to 4 (1.0%) (P=0.0483). The DVT, SVT, hematoma and wound infection rates were similar in the two groups. Ablation of the saphenous veins in patients who are on oral anticoagulation is safe and does not increase the risk of bleeding or hematoma, but it may slightly lower the incidence of EHIT and increase the incidence of failure of ablation."}

PRIM1 plays a crucial role in DNA replication by synthesizing RNA primers for Okazaki fragments. It is closely associated with age at natural menopause, early menopause and POI in European women. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether mutations in PRIM1 contribute to POI in Chinese women. All exons and exon-intron boundaries of PRIM1 gene were sequenced in 192 Han Chinese women with non-syndromic POI. No plausible mutations were identified. The results suggest that the perturbations in PRIM1 gene are not a common explanation for POI in Chinese women."}

In order to better understand changes in waterbird population, it is essential to figure out what they feed on. However, analyzing their diet could be difficult and inefficient using traditional methods such as microhistologic observation. Here, we addressed this gap of knowledge by investigating the diet of greater white-fronted goose Anser albifrons and bean goose Anser fabalis, which are obligate herbivores wintering in China, mostly in the Middle and Lower Yangtze River floodplain. First, we selected a suitable and high-resolution marker gene for wetland plants that these geese would consume during the wintering period. Eight candidate genes were included: rbcL, rpoC1, rpoB, matK, trnH-psbA, trnL (UAA), atpF-atpH, and psbK-psbI. The selection was performed via analysis of representative sequences from NCBI and comparison of amplification efficiency and resolution power of plant samples collected from the wintering area. The trnL gene was chosen at last with c/h primers, and a local plant reference library was constructed with this gene. Then, utilizing DNA metabarcoding, we discovered 15 food items in total from the feces of these birds. Of the 15 unique dietary sequences, 10 could be identified at specie level. As for greater white-fronted goose, 73% of sequences belonged to Poaceae spp., and 26% belonged to Carex spp. In contrast, almost all sequences of bean goose belonged to Carex spp. (99%). Using the same samples, microhistology provided consistent food composition with metabarcoding results for greater white-fronted goose, while 13% of Poaceae was recovered for bean goose. In addition, two other taxa were discovered only through microhistologic analysis. Although most of the identified taxa matched relatively well between the two methods, DNA metabarcoding gave taxonomically more detailed information. Discrepancies were likely due to biased PCR amplification in metabarcoding, low discriminating power of current marker genes for monocots, and biases in microhistologic analysis. The diet differences between two geese species might indicate deeper ecological significance beyond the scope of this study. We concluded that DNA metabarcoding provides new perspectives for studies of herbivorous waterbird diets and inter-specific interactions, as well as new possibilities to investigate interactions between herbivores and plants. In addition, microhistologic analysis should be used together with metabarcoding methods to integrate this information."}

This study aims to identify the patient cohorts more likely to benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy based on the tumor micro-immune environment. CD8 + TILs significantly associated with disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survial (OS) (p=0.002; 0.040). Patients with high risk factors may also predict shorter DFS (P=0.056).

There's no correlation between PD-L1 expressions and survival. PD-L1 was highly expressed in men, squamous and well differentiated carcinoma. In addition, Foxp3 + TILs alone didn't show any prognostic effects, but low - Foxp3 / high - CD8 + TILs were associated with prolonged DFS (p=0.031).

In a group of individuals with a family history of major depressive (MDD) or bipolar disorder (BD), we investigated the microstructural properties of white matter fiber tracts, that is, cingulum bundle, uncinate fasciculus, anterior limb of the internal capsule, and corpus callosum, that facilitate the communication between brain regions implicated in affective disorders. Eighty-nine healthy mono - or dizygotic twins with a co-twin diagnosed with MDD or BD (high-risk) and 57 healthy twins with a co-twin with no familial history of affective disorders (low-risk) were included in a diffusion tensor imaging study. The high-risk group showed decreased fractional anisotropy (FA), a measure of water diffusion directionality, and increased radial diffusivity in the anterior region of corpus callosum compared to the low-risk group. This abnormality was not associated with zygosity or type of depressive disorder of co-twin. The observed decreased anterior callosal fiber FA in the high-risk group may be indicative of a compromised interhemispheric communication between left and right frontal regions critically involved in mood regulation. Reduced anterior callosal FA may act as a vulnerability marker for affective disorders in individuals at familial risk."}

The aim of this article is to shed light on performance markers of active avoidance (AA) using two different rat strains, Sprague-Dawley (SD) and Wistar. Specifically, good and poor performers were evaluated regarding anxiety traits exhibited in the elevated plus maze (EPM) and corticosterone levels and motor activity in the open field test. In addition, the plasma levels of Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Interleukin-1Beta (IL-1beta), Nerve Growth Factor Beta (NGF-beta), Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha (TNF-alpha) and cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant 1 (CINC-1) were compared in the good and poor performers to better understand the role of the immunologic system in aversive learning. Behavioral criteria were employed to identify subpopulations of SD and Wistar rats based on their behavioral scores during a two-way AA test. The animals were tested for anxiety -like behavior in the EPM and motor activity in the open-field test. Plasma corticosterone levels were measured at the end of the avoidance test. Cytokine levels of IL-6, IL-1beta, NGF-beta, TNF-alpha, and CINC-1 were measured in the plasma of the Wistar rats. Sixty-six percent of the Wistar rats and 35% of the SD rats exhibited a poor performance. This feature was associated with a decrease in anxiety -like behavior in the EPM. The poor and good performers exhibited lower levels of corticosterone compared with the control animals, which suggests that training alters corticosterone levels, thereby leading to hypocortisolism, independent of the performance. The CINC-1 levels were increased in the poor performers, which reinforces the role of immunologic system activation in learning deficits. Our study provides a better understanding of the complex interactions that underlie neuroimmune consequences and their implications for performance."}

However, limited reports describe their safety and efficacy profiles in very small anterior communicating artery aneurysms. We sought to review and report the immediate and long-term clinical as well as radiographic outcomes of consecutive patients with ruptured very small anterior communicating artery aneurysms treated with current endovascular coil embolization techniques. A prospectively maintained single-institution neuroendovascular database was accessed to identify consecutive cases of very small (<3 mm) ruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysms treated endovascularly between 2006 and 2013. A total of 20 patients with ruptured very small (<3 mm) anterior communicating artery aneurysms were consecutively treated with coil embolization. The average maximum diameter was 2.66 \u00b1 0.41 mm. Complete aneurysm occlusion was achieved for 17 (85%) aneurysms and near-complete aneurysm occlusion for 3 (15%) aneurysms. Intraoperative perforation was seen in 2 (10%) patients without any clinical worsening or need for an external ventricular drain. A thromboembolic event occurred in 1 (5 %) patient without clinical worsening or radiologic infarct.

The yield of dichloroacetonitrile (DCAN) was higher than other N-DBPs, such as dichloroacetamide (DCAcAm) and chloropicrin (TCNM) during the chlorination of Asp. The formation of DCAN, DCAcAm, and TCNM all showed a trend of first increasing and then decreasing during the chlorination of Asp with increasing contact time. The dosage of chlorine had an impact on the formation of DCAN, DCAcAm, and TCNM. The highest yields of DCAN and DCAcAm appeared when the Cl2 / Asp molar ratio was about 20, the yield of TCNM increased with increasing the Cl2 / Asp molar ratio from 5 to 30 and TCNM was not produced when the ratio was less than 5. Cyanogen chloride (CNCl) was detected when the Cl2 / Asp molar ratio was lower than 5. N-DBPs formation was influenced by pH. DCAN formation increased with increasing pH from 5 to 6 and then decreased with increasing pH from 6 to 9, but DCAcAm and TCNM increased with increasing pH from 5 to 8 and then decreased. Higher temperatures reduced the formation of DCAN and DCAcAm, but increased TCNM formation. DCAN and DCAcAm formation decreased, and relatively stable TCNM formation increased, with increasing free chlorine contact time during chloramination. N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) was produced during chloramination of Asp and increased with prolonged chloramination contact time.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of midodrine, tolvaptan and their combination in control of refractory or recurrent ascites in cirrhotics. Fifty cirrhotic patients with refractory or recurrent ascites were randomised to receive midodrine (n=13), tolvaptan (n=12) or both (n=13) plus standard medical therapy (SMT) or SMT alone (n=12). A significant increase in urinary volume and urinary sodium at 1 and 3 months (P<.05) was observed in all groups except SMT. There was no worsening of renal or hepatic function in any group. There was deterioration of model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) in SMT. Midodrine as well as combination of midodrine and tolvaptan but not tolvaptan alone was superior to SMT in control of ascites at 3 months (P<.05).

However, the underlying mechanisms determining these morphological differences are remain to be defined. To better understand the proteomic changes between DP and TP, tandem mass tags (TMT) mass spectrometry (MS) / MS was used to detect the significant changes to protein expression between DP and TP. Results indicated that both photosynthesis and metabolic pathways were highly significantly associated with proteomic alteration between DP and TP based on biological process and pathway enrichment analysis, and 13 higher abundance chloroplast proteins involving in these two pathways were identified in TP. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that 5 of the 13 chloroplast proteins ATPF, PSAA, PSAB, PSBB and RBL in TP were higher abundance compared with those in DP.

While HCV epidemiology, pathophysiology, and therapy are being deeply studied, rare attention is given to reciprocal interactions between HCV infection, HCV -induced chronic liver diseases, and the human gut microbiome. As Egypt has the world's highest prevalence of HCV infections, we launched this study to monitor differences in the gut microbial community composition of Egyptian HCV patients that may affect, or result from, the patients ' liver state. To this end, we analyzed stool samples from six stage 4 - HCV patients and eight healthy individuals by high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing using Illumina MiSeq. Overall, the alpha-diversity of the healthy persons' gut microbiomes was higher than those of the HCV patients. Whereas members of phylum Bacteroidetes were more abundant in HCV patients, healthy individuals had higher abundance of Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria. Genus -level analysis showed differential abundance of Prevotella and Faecalibacterium (higher in HCV patients) vs. Ruminococcus and Clostridium (healthy group), indicating that the higher abundance of Bacteroidetes in HCV patients is most likely due to Prevotella overabundance. The probiotic genus, Bifidobacterium, was only observed in the microbiotas of healthy individuals. To the best of our knowledge, this study provides a first overview of major phyla and genera differentiating stage 4 - HCV patients from healthy individuals and suggests possible microbiome remodeling in chronic hepatitis C, possibly shaped by bacterial translocation as well as the liver's impaired role in digestion and protein synthesis. Future studies will investigate the microbiome composition and functional capabilities in more patients while tracing some potential biomarker taxa (e.g., Prevotella, Faecalibacterium vs. Bifidobacterium)."}

However, the molecular basis of DRG1 in cell proliferation regulation and the relationship between DRG1 and tumor progression remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that DRG1 is elevated in lung adenocarcinomas while weakly expressed in adjacent lung tissues. DRG1 knockdown causes growth inhibition of tumor cells by significantly increasing the proportion of cells in M phase. Overexpression of DRG1 leads to chromosome missegregation which is an important index for tumorigenesis. Interestingly, ectopic of DRG1 reduces taxol induced apoptosis of lung adenocarcinoma cells. Mechanistic analyses confirm that DRG1 localizes at mitotic spindles in dividing cells and binds to spindle checkpoint signaling proteins in vivo. These studies highlight the expanding role of DRG1 in tumorigenesis and reveal a mechanism of DRG1 in taxol resistance."}

Among these, the gelsolin proteins sever actin filaments, cap their fast growing end and nucleate actin assembly in a calcium - dependent manner. Here, we focus on the gelsolin of the onychophoran Peripatoides novaezealandiae and the eutardigrade Hypsibius dujardini. From the cDNA of P. novaezealandiae we obtained the complete coding sequence with an open reading frame of 2178 bp. It encodes a protein of 726 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 82,610.9Da and a pI of 5.57. This sequence is comprised of six segments (S1-S6). However, analysis of data from TardiBase reveals that the gelsolin of the eutardigrade Hypsibius dujardini has only three segments (S1-S3). The coding sequence consist of 1119 bp for 373 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 42,440.95Da and a pI of 6.17. The Peripatoides and Hypsibius gelsolin revealed both conserved binding motifs for G-actin, F-actin and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), along with a full set of type-1 and type-2 Ca(2+) - binding sites which could result in the binding of eight and four calcium ions, respectively. Both gelsolin proteins lack a C-terminal latch-helix indicating a more rapid activation in the submicromolar Ca(2+) range. We suggest that a gelsolin with three segments was present in the last common ancestor of the ecdysozoan clade Panarthropoda (Onychophora, Tardigrada, Arthropoda), primarily because the gelsolin of all non-Ecdysozoa studied so far (except Chordata) reveals this number of segments. Mapping of our molecular data onto a well-established phylogeny revealed that the number of gelsolin segments does not correlate with the phylogenetic lineage but rather with particular functional demands to alter the kinetics of actin polymerization."}

Great efforts had been made to detect the molecular mechanisms which led to the invasion and metastasis in ESCC. Recent evidence had suggested that deregulation of miR-424-5p took an important role in cancers. However, its role and functional mechanism in ESCC had seldom been elucidated. The expression levels of miR-424-5p were detected in ESCC tissues and cell lines by real-time PCR methods. Then, the invasion, metastasis and proliferation ability of ESCC cell lines transfected with miR-424-5p mimics were analyzed separately by transwell invasion assay, wound healing assay and cell proliferation assay. Finally, the target gene of miR-424-5p was studied and verified by luciferase activity assay. And the role of miR-424-5p in EMT was also investigated by real-time PCR and western blot assay. We showed that the expression levels of miR-424-5p were decreased both in ESCC tissues and cell lines. Furthermore, the expression levels of miR-424-5p were negatively linked to lymph node metastasis in ESCC tissues. Restoration of miR-424-5p in EC-1 cells by using miR-424-5p mimics could decrease the invasion, metastasis and proliferation of EC-1 cells, indicating its role in inhibition on the invasion and metastasis ability of ESCC cells and tissues. In addition, we demonstrated that SMAD7 was a specific target gene for miR-424-5p by luciferase activity assay and miR-424-5p could not only negatively regulate SMAD7 expression but also participate in EMT via SMAD7, because overexpression of SMAD7 could partly enhance the miR-424-5p anti-EMT function. Our results described that miR-424-5p - SMAD7 pathway contributed to ESCC invasion and metastasis and up-regulation of miR-424-5p perhaps provided a strategy for preventing tumor invasion, metastasis."}

However, existing methods suffered from not only unavoidability of cell damaging conditions and/or sophisticated equipment, but also unavailability of proper materials to satisfy both mechanical and biological expectations. In this work, a simple method is proposed to prepare cell - encapsulated fibers with tunable mechanical strength and stretching behavior as well as diameter and microstructure. The hydrogel fibers are made from optimal combination of alginate and poly(N-iso-propylacrylamide)-poly(ethylene glycol), characteristics of double-network hydrogel, with enough stiffness and flexibility to create a variety of three dimensional structures like parallel helical and different knots without crack. Furthermore, such hydrogel fibers exhibit better compatibility as indicated by the viability, proliferation and expression of pluripotency markers of embryonic stem cells encapsulated after 4-day culture. The double-network hydrogel possesses specific quick responses to either of alginate lyase, EDTA or lower environmental temperature which facilitate the optional degradation of fibers or fibrous assemblies to release the cells encapsulated for subsequent assay or treatment."}

Reproductive immaturity is generally associated with the migratory process (oogenesis - flight syndrome), but the mechanism of reproductive development during migration varies unpredictably. Here, the vitellogenin gene (MsVg) and three key regulatory enzyme genes (MsJhamt, MsJheh and MsJhe) related to juvenile hormone (JH) synthesis and degradation were identified and characterized in Mythimna separata. The relative expression of MsVg varied significantly in response to seasonal changes and was significantly correlated with stages of ovarian development. The relatively low levels of JH titer did not differ significantly in male moths but slightly increased in female adults during the migratory season, which was consistent with changes in mRNA levels for MsJhamt, MsJheh and MsJhe. JH titer was negatively associated with relative seasonal levels of vitellogenin mRNA transcripts and with ovarian development in migrating M. separata. The synchrony of MsVg expression with sexual maturation highlighted the potential of MsVg transcript levels to serve as an index to monitor the adult reproductive status. In addition, the level of JH and sexual maturity were correlated with the extent of JH in regulating the MsVg expression and reproduction during seasonal northern and southern migration."}

Application to children has also been started. We retrospectively analyze a case series of 4 children and 17 adults with SSD, treated with cochlear implantation. The outcome of adult patients was compared with a control group of 27 patients with bilateral profound hearing loss using a cochlear implant. During 12 months, the mean speech recognition score increased from 30 to 41% for monosyllabic words in adults, and from 58 to 89% for multisyllabic numbers. The cochlear implant (CI) improved hearing in noise in all SSD patients, as was demonstrated by a significant improvement of the speech reception threshold in different speech and noise configurations. Sound localization -correlated angle detection error improved with CI use at every time point. The maximum word recognition score for monosyllabic words in quiet correlated with the logarithm of the duration of deafness; improvement of the speech reception threshold and RMS angle detection error by the CI did not. All SSD patients benefitted from the CI in different hearing situations. Patients with SSD for a long period can improve after cochlear implantation."}

This prospective case series included 42 consecutive patients with unilateral exudative AMD. Choroidal images were segmented into luminal area and stromal area. Choroidal vascularity index was defined as the ratio of luminal area to total choroid area.

It is widely known that disruption of the BBB occurs in various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Annexin A1 (ANXA1), an anti-inflammatory messenger, is expressed in brain endothelial cells and regulates the BBB integrity. However, its role and mechanism for protecting BBB in AD have not been identified. We found that \u03b2-Amyloid 1-42 (A\u03b242)-induced BBB disruption was rescued by human recombinant ANXA1 (hrANXA1) in the murine brain endothelial cell line bEnd.3. Also, ANXA1 was decreased in the bEnd.3 cells, the capillaries of 5XFAD mice, and the human serum of patients with AD. To find out the mechanism by which ANXA1 recovers the BBB integrity in AD, the RhoA-ROCK signaling pathway was examined in both A\u03b242 -treated bEnd.3 cells and the capillaries of 5XFAD mice as RhoA was activated in both cases. RhoA inhibitors alleviated A\u03b242 -induced BBB disruption and constitutively overexpressed RhoA-GTP (active form of RhoA) attenuated the protective effect of ANXA1. When pericytes were cocultured with bEnd.3 cells, A\u03b242 -induced RhoA activation of bEnd.3 cells was inhibited by the secretion of ANXA1 from pericytes. Taken together, our results suggest that ANXA1 restores A\u03b242 -induced BBB disruption through inhibition of RhoA-ROCK signaling pathway and we propose ANXA1 as a therapeutic reagent, protecting against the breakdown of the BBB in AD."}

There was no association of CKD with daytime sleepiness. In men with CKD, those with OSA were not significantly more likely to report symptoms (sleepiness, snoring, apneas) or be identified with the STOP OSA screening questionnaire, compared to men without OSA. Predominantly mild CKD is associated with severe OSA and arousals. Further population studies examining the longitudinal relationship between CKD and OSA are warranted. Better methods are needed to identify OSA in CKD which may have few symptoms."}

To characterize the factor(s) present in diluted plasma responsible for this phenomenon we performed i) heat inactivation, ii) dialysis, iii) proteinase K treatment, and iv) molecular size filtration studies. We found that this remarkable pro-migratory activity of diluted normal plasma is associated with a ~50-100-kD protein that interacts with G\u03b1I protein-coupled receptors and activates p42/44 MAPK and AKT signaling in target cells. Since this pro-migratory activity of 1% plasma decreases at higher plasma concentrations (> 20%), but is retained in serum, we hypothesized that fibrinogen may be involved as a chaperone of the protein(s). To identify the pro-migratory protein(s) present in diluted plasma and fibrinogen -depleted serum, we performed gel filtration and hydrophobic interaction chromatography followed by mass spectrometry analysis. We identified several putative protein candidates that were further tested in in vitro experiments. We found that this pro-migratory factor chaperoned by fibrinogen is vitronectin, which activates uPAR, and that this effect can be inhibited by fibrinogen. These results provide a novel mechanism for the metastasis of cancer cells to lymphatics and body cavities, in which the concentration of fibrinogen is low, and thus suggests that free vitronectin stimulates migration of tumor cells."}

The objective of this study was to develop and initially evaluate the psychometric properties of an instrument designed to measure the comfort and tolerability of FFRs. Instrument items were developed through literature reviews, focus groups, and several iterations of ranking and refining by experts. Psychometric evaluation of the instrument was conducted using Rasch partial credit model (PCM) analysis. Pivot anchoring was used to specify the threshold defining item difficulty; in our analyses, this was the point that participants moved from possessing none of the trait to some of the trait. The final instrument was completed by 165 health care personnel from 3 Veterans Health Administration facilities, and data were analyzed using Rasch PCM. Seven items were removed because they: (1) violated the assumption of independence; (2) were mis-fitting; and/or (3) were deemed not relevant. Category function analysis demonstrated that all categories progressed monotonically. Principal components analysis demonstrated the existence of three subscales (Discomfort, General Wearing Experience, and Function). Final reliability analyses showed that the scale had moderate to high person reliability and high item reliability. The final instrument contained 21 items. Until now, to our knowledge no instrument with evidence supporting its reliability and validity to assess discomfort and tolerance of FFRs among health care personnel has been published. A 21-item psychometrically sound measure of comfort and tolerability of FFRs, Respirator Comfort, Wearing Experience, and Function Instrument (R-COMFI), was developed. The significance of developing such an instrument is that it will help identify respirators that are likely to have better adherence in practice settings. The R-COMFI may be used within and beyond the VA healthcare system as a psychometrically sound instrument to evaluate the comfort and tolerability of respirators, including developmental prototypes."}

Seven hundred and twenty primary KTRs and 119 repeat KTRs were used for comparison. Samples were collected pretransplantation, at +1, +2, and +3 months post-transplantation. Alloreactive and CMV-specific T cells were measured by interferon-\u03b3 ELISPOT assay. Patient survival in KTRs after SOT, primary and repeat KTRs was comparable. While death -censored allograft survival was comparable between KTRs after SOT and primary KTRs, KTRs after SOT showed superior 5-year death -censored allograft survival of 92.5% compared to 81.2% in repeat KTRs. Interestingly, KTRs after SOT show less preformed panel-reactive antibodies, frequencies of alloreactive T cells, and acute rejections compared to repeat KTRs. KTRs after SOT, however, show higher incidences of EBV viremia and PTLD, sepsis, and death from sepsis. Impaired CMV-specific cellular immunity was associated with more CMV replication compared to repeat KTRs. Our results suggest comparable patient and allograft outcomes in KTRs after SOT and primary KTRs. The observed low alloreactivity may contribute to excellent allograft outcomes.

The purpose of this study was to estimate the breast cancer detection, incident and prevalence rates among Thai women. We retrospectively reviewed the opportunistic mammography screening of normal women between 30 and 80 years who underwent the procedure between 2001 and 2010. All cases were followed until 2012. The detection rate was calculated for the whole period of observation using ' number of women with positive findings ' divided by ' total number of women screened '. The incidence rate was calculated only at the first MMG while the subsequence rate was calculated based on all new cases detected at each subsequent MMG. Among the 47,430 women, there were 152,091 MMGs or approximately 3.2 occasions per person (range, 1-10). The average duration of the interval between each subsequence visit was 1.8 years. Overall, breast cancer was detected in 543 women, with a detection rate of 10.3 per 1,000 persons. The prevalence rate of breast cancer at the first visit was 5.78 per 1,000 person s. The incidence or new cases detected at any follow-up visit was 10.4 per 1,000 person s. The overall interval cancer was 0.91 per 1,000 women, mainly detected before their second and third MMG, with a rate of 0.0.47 and 0.76 per 1,000 women. Opportunistic mammography screening in Thailand detected 10 cases of breast cancer from each 1,000 women.

The main agricultural activities threaten the groundwater therein with nitrate contamination given the large fertiliser and water needs. The present work tests the applicability of the susceptibility index assessment method in evaluating the impact of agricultural activities on groundwater quality, using as a case study an aquifer of the Guayas river basin in Ecuador. The index adapts four parameters of the DRASTIC method and incorporated a new land use parameter. Results show that the areas highly vulnerable to contamination are located in irrigation perimeters of dominant paddy fields associated with the high recharge rates in the alluvial deposits. Respectively, moderately vulnerable and low - vulnerability areas correspond to aquatic environments and forests, semi-natural zones and water bodies. One of the main contributions of the Daule aquifer vulnerability is likely its wide, flat topography. A great part of the aquifer is at high risk of contamination by nitrates if a code of good agricultural practices is not applied. Therefore the implementation of a monitoring network to control the nitrates concentrations is the first step to assure groundwater quality for drinking purposes."}

However, little is known about its role in humoral immune responses. In this study, we investigated the expression profile of PLA2 in different tissues and developmental stages in Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel), and the results showed that the transcriptional level of PLA2 was high in the egg and mature stage and in the testis tissue. Bacterial infection increased the expression of PLA2, and the highest degree of up-regulation appeared in the fat body. Silencing PLA2 influenced the expression of immune-related genes, including MyD88 and defensin in the Toll pathway and relish and diptericin in the Imd pathway. Moreover, the expression of MyD88 and defensin was down-regulated significantly in the ds-PLA2 group compared with those in the ds-egfp group when B. dorsalis was infected with L. monocytogenes and S. aureus, indicating that PLA2 was involved in the activation of the Toll pathway. Meanwhile, infection with L. monocytogenes and E. coli, which activate the Imd pathway, does not increase the mRNA levels of relish and diptericin in the ds-PLA2 group as severely as it increases those in the ds-egfp group, indicating that the Imd pathway was also repressed after silencing PLA2. Notably, the development of lipid droplets in fat body cells was influenced by silencing PLA2, implying that PLA2 affects the function of fat body tissue. These results suggest that the PLA2 gene may mediate humoral immune responses by reducing lipid storage in fat body cells in B. dorsalis."}

Methods Analysis was conducted on 4,727 participants of Thailand's 2013 National Mental Health Survey, a multistage stratified cluster survey, using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Diagnoses of problem and pathological gambling and other psychiatric disorders were based on the DSM-IV-TR criteria with the following additional criteria for gamblers: more than 10 lifetime gambling episodes and a single year loss of at least 365 USD from gambling. Results The estimated lifetime prevalence rates of pathological and problem gambling were 0.90% [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.51-1.29] and 1.14% (95% CI: 0.58-1.70), respectively. The most popular type of gambling was playing lotteries [69.5%, standard error (SE) = 1.9], the prevalence of which was significantly higher among females and older age groups. The most common psychiatric disorders seen among pathological gamblers were alcohol abuse (57.4%), nicotine dependence (49.5%), and any drug use disorder (16.2%). Pathological gambling was highly prevalent among those who ever experienced major depressive episodes (5.5%), any drug dependence (5.1%), and intermittent explosive disorder (4.8%).

This study compared the novel dual EP3 / FP agonist ONO-9054 with the FP agonist Xalatan. Adults (n=123) with bilateral mild/moderate OAG or OHT, with unmedicated IOP of \u226524 mm Hg at 8:00 hours, \u226521 mm Hg at 10:00 hours and \u226436 mm Hg, were randomised 1:1 to receive ONO-9054 (0.003%, 30 \u03bcg/mL) or Xalatan (0.005%, 50 \u03bcg/mL) once daily for 28 days. Day 29 mean diurnal IOP was -7.2 mm Hg for ONO-9054 vs -6.6 mm Hg for Xalatan. At 08:00 hours, the IOPs were comparable, and at all later time points the decrease in IOP was greater for ONO-9054. On day 29, the odds of a mean IOP reduction of \u2264-25%, \u2264-30% and \u2264-35% for ONO-9054 were 2.39, 2.37 and 4.85 times more, respectively, than the odds for Xalatan (p<0.05, post hoc analyses). The percentage of subjects achieving target IOPs on day 29 (\u226417, \u226416 and \u226415 mm Hg) was greater for ONO-9054 than for Xalatan; the odds of achieving an IOP \u226415 mm Hg for ONO-9054 were 2.4 times more than the odds for Xalatan (p<0.01, post hoc analysis). Subjects randomised to receive ONO-9054 were more likely to achieve a greater per cent reduction in IOP and were more likely to achieve target IOPs than those receiving Xalatan. The effects of ONO-9054 in reducing IOP appear to persist longer than those of Xalatan. NCT02083289, Results."}

We aimed to compare 2 different modes of resistance training, an isometric mode with the Huber Motion Lab (HML) and traditional strength training (TST), in CHD patients undergoing a cardiac rehabilitation program. We randomly assigned 50 patients to HML or TST. Patients underwent complete blinded evaluation before and after the rehabilitation program, including testing for cardiopulmonary exercise, maximal isometric voluntary contraction, endothelial function and body composition. After 4 weeks of training (16 sessions), the groups did not differ in body composition, anthropometric characteristics, or endothelial function. With HML, peak power output (P=0.035), maximal heart rate (P<0.01) and gain of force measured in the chest press position (P<0.02) were greater after versus before training. Both protocols appeared to be well tolerated, safe and feasible for these CHD patients. A training protocol involving 6s phases of isometric contractions with 10s of passive recovery on an HML device could be safely implemented in rehabilitation programs for patients with CHD and improve functional outcomes."}

Identifying learning needs for post-cardiac intervention patients is essential to establish successful health education programmes based on patient central care. A descriptive comparative design was employed on a convenience sample of 260 patients who underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention and 105 patients who underwent open-heart surgery patients. Participants had completed the Patient Learning Needs Scale. Data were collected between 1 October 2014 and 31 June 2015. Patients from the two groups highly requesting health and recovery related information. They scored all learning need topics as important or highly important for them. The top priority learning need for both patient groups was ' information about wound care ', and the lowest priority learning need topic was ' physical activity '. The learning needs of both groups were very close, which indicated that educational secondary prevention programmes ' content can be prepared in a unified structure for those patients. Although, specific headings can be used to address the unique needs that emerge from having a specific cardiac interventional procedure. The fact that wound care and medications are areas of highest learning needs for patients requires health policy decision makers to address these topics at the time of hospital discharge. In addition, a policy focus on considering patients ' actual learning needs requires establishment and managerial support. As patients ' learning needs might change later after discharge, the health services should be proactive and focus on continuous support for patients after hospital discharge. Secondary prevention programmes should incorporate health education topics based on patients ' own views. This can be done by giving higher priority to understand patients' needs, put much more effort into how to meet patients ' information needs and to create a more engaging learning environment for patients and their families."}

These aspects have rarely been studied in combination and/or at the intra-specific level. Here we applied 3D dental surface texture analysis to a sample of field voles (Microtus agrestis) trapped from Finnish Lapland at different seasons and localities to test for inter-population variations. We also explored intra-individual variation in chewing dynamics by analysing two facets on the second upper molars. Our results confirm that the two localities have similar environments and that the voles feed on the same items there. On the other hand, the texture data suggest that diets are seasonally variable, probably due to varying concentrations of abrasives. Lastly, the textures on the buccal facets are more isotropic and their direction deviates more from the mesial chewing direction than the lingual facets. We interpret these results as reflecting food, rather than chewing, movements, where food particles are more guided on the lingual side of the molars. This has implications for the application of dental microwear analysis to fossils: only homologous facets can be compared, even when the molar row seems to constitute a functional unit."}

We recently showed that human cathelicidin LL-37 exhibits inhibitory effects on biofilm formation of S. mutans through interaction with lipoteichoic acid (LTA), but without antibacterial or biofilm dispersal abilities. (-)-Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is the most abundant constituent of tea catechins that has the greatest anti-infective potential to inhibit the growth of various microorganisms and biofilm formation. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated whether LL-37 interacts with EGCG to enhance the antibiofilm effect of EGCG on S. mutans biofilm formation. Clinical S. mutans strains (n = 10) isolated from children's saliva were tested in a biofilm formation assay. The antibiofilm effect of EGCG with and without LL-37 was analyzed by the minimum biofilm eradication concentration assay and confirmed using field emission-scanning electron microscopy. In addition, the interaction among EGCG, LL-37, and LTA of S. mutans was determined using quartz crystal microbalance analysis. EGCG killed 100 % of planktonic S. mutans within 5 h, inhibited biofilm formation within 24 h, and reduced bacteria cells in preformed biofilms within 3 h at a concentration of 0.2 mg/mL. However, EGCG did not appear to interact with LTA. LL-37 effectively enhanced the bactericidal activity of EGCG against biofilm formation and preformed biofilms as determined by quantitative crystal violet staining and field emission-scanning electron microscopy. In addition, quartz crystal microbalance analysis revealed that LL-37 interacted with EGCG and promoted binding between EGCG and LTA of S. mutans. We show that LL-37 enhances the antibiofilm effect of EGCG on S. mutans. This finding provides new knowledge for dental treatment by using LL-37 as a potential antibiofilm compound."}

In the cross-sectional analyses behavioural problems were associated with several self-reported wireless device use measures but not operator -recorded mobile phone use measures, concentration capacity was associated with several self-reported and operator -recorded exposures. The longitudinal analyses point towards absence of associations. The lack of consistent exposure -response patterns in the longitudinal analyses suggests that behavioural problems and concentration capacity are not affected by the use of wireless communication devices or RF-EMF exposure.

However, the gap between the dilator and the guiding catheter of the sheathless system is larger than the gap between the dilator and sheath of the introducer system, resulting in stronger insertion resistance. A twisting method with rapid alternating rotation of a device to the left and right during insertion can reduce the insertion resistance. This method can be effective with the sheathless system which has a larger gap. To examine the effect of size reduction on the sheathless system and the effect of insertion resistance reduction using the twisting method, we developed an insertion simulator and compared insertion resistance to a 5-Fr sheath introducer and a 5-Fr sheathless system, with and without the twisting method. The insertion simulator pushed a sheath introducer or a sheathless system toward a mock artery consisted with a 5-mm urethane and a 1-mm rubber sheet by an electrical motor with or without twisting motion generated by a crank shaft. Insertion resistance during the penetration was measured by a tension meter. The insertion resistance was less with the 5-Fr sheathless system than with the 5-Fr sheath introducer. The resistance reduced further with use of twisting for both the sheathed and sheathless catheters. In conclusion, the experiment suggests the benefits of twisting insertion of a sheathless guiding catheter for reduction of puncture site -related complications."}

So far, alternatives to conventional secretion were primarily observed and studied in yeast and animal cells. The sessile lifestyle of plants brings with it unique restraints on how they adapt to adverse conditions and environmental challenges. Recently, attention towards unconventional secretion pathways in plant cells has substantially increased, with the large number of leaderless proteins identified through proteomic studies. While UPS pathways in plants are certainly not yet exhaustively researched, an emerging notion is that induction of UPS pathways is correlated with pathogenesis and stress responses. Given the multitude UPS events observed, comprehensively organizing the routes proteins take to the apoplast in defined UPS categories is challenging. With the establishment of a larger collection of studied plant proteins taking these UPS pathways, a clearer picture of endomembrane trafficking as a whole will emerge. There are several novel enabling technologies, such as vesicle proteomics and chemical genomics, with great potential for dissecting secretion pathways, providing information about the cargo that travels along them and the conditions that induce them."}

Despite negative psychological and physical consequences, BN/BED patients show uncontrollable approach tendencies towards food. This cognitive bias occurs at an early stage of information processing. Cognitive bias modification (CBM) directly targets such biases and has been shown to be effective in treating several mental disorders. In alcohol addiction, automatic action tendencies towards alcohol cues and relapse rates were successfully reduced by a specific form of CBM, termed approach bias modification. Based on these findings and data from a proof-of-concept study in people with high levels of food craving, CBM is considered a promising new treatment approach for BN/BED. Given the similarities between BN/BED and addictive disorders, the rationale for using approach bias modification appears to be particularly strong. The aim of the present study is to examine whether, compared to a sham training, computerised approach bias modification (10 sessions) can reduce binge-eating episodes in BN/BED patients from pre-treatment to follow-up. Additionally, we will investigate whether this CBM programme also reduces global eating disorder psychopathology, trait and cue-elicited food craving, food intake as well as approach and attentional bias towards visual food cues. Treatment acceptance will be determined by attrition rates and responses on a feedback form. This is a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-group superiority trial with two parallel arms. A total of 54 BN/BED patients will be recruited. Approach bias towards food will be retrained by a computer task adopting an implicit learning paradigm. Patients in the control condition (sham) will conduct a similar task but will not be trained to avoid food cues. Methods against bias include public registration, randomisation by a central study office, standardisation of the treatments and blinding of assessors. Furthermore, the session number and duration will be equivalent in the two conditions. This is the first registered randomised controlled trial of approach bias modification in a clinical BN/BED sample. Results from this study will provide an indication of the efficacy of approach bias modification training for BN/BED and the potential mechanisms of action underlying this treatment.

In this work, a series of monomethoxy-poly (ethylene glycol)-poly (\u03b5-caprolactone-co-D,L-lactide) (MPEG-PCLA) copolymers with variable composition of poly (\u03b5-caprolactone) (PCL) and poly (D,L-lactide) (PDLLA) were prepared via ring-opening copolymerization of \u03b5-CL and D,L-LA in the presence of MPEG and stannous octoate. The structure and molecular weight were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The crystallinity, hydrophilicity, thermal stability and hydrolytic degradation behavior were investigated in detail, respectively. The results showed that the prepared amphiphilic MPEG-PCLA copolymers have adjustable properties by altering the composition of PCLA, which make it convenient for clinical applications. Besides, the drug loading properties were also studied. Docetaxel (DTX) could be entrapped in MPEG-PCLA micelles with high loading capacity and encapsulation efficiency. And all lyophilized DTX -loaded MPEG-PCLA micelles except MPEG-PCL micelles were readily re-dissolved in normal saline at 25 \u00b0C. In addition, DTX -loaded MPEG-PCLA micelles showed a slightly enhanced antitumor activity compared with free DTX. Furthermore, DTX micelles exhibited a slower and sustained release behavior in vitro, and higher DTX concentration and longer retention time in vivo. The results suggested that the MPEG-PCLA copolymer with the adjustable ratio of PCL to PDLLA may be a promising drug delivery carrier for DTX."}

We estimated world population age-standardized incidence rates (ASRs) and age-standardized mortality rates (ASMRs) per 100,000 person - years. We calculated ASRs by histological subtype. We estimated the annual percentage change (EAPC) to describe time trends. Between CSA countries, TC incidence and mortality rates varied from 8-fold to 12-fold and from 2-fold to 5-fold, respectively. In 2003-2007, the highest TC ASRs in females and males were in Ecuador (16.0 and 3.5, respectively), Brazil (14.4 and 3.4), Costa Rica (12.6 and 2.1) and Colombia (10.7 and 2.5). The highest ASMRs were in Ecuador, Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Panama (0.68-0.91 in females and 0.41-0.48 in males). Papillary TC was the most commonly diagnosed histological subtype, following the same incidence pattern as overall TC. In Argentinean, Brazilian, Chilean and Costa Rican females TC incidence increased by 2.2-17.9% annually, and papillary TC increased by 9.1-15.0% annually, while mortality remained stable between 1997 and 2008. In males, trends in TC were stable. TC occurred more frequently in females than in males. The overall high incidence and low mortality of TC suggest identification of subclinical disease due to improved detection methods."}

EPO is a glycoprotein hormone that is essential for normal erythropoiesis and is predominantly synthesized by peritubular renal interstitial fibroblast-like cells, which express cellular markers characteristic of neuronal cells and pericytes. To investigate whether the ability to synthesize EPO is a general functional feature of pericytes, we used conditional gene targeting to examine the von Hippel-Lindau / prolyl-4-hydroxylase domain (PHD)/HIF axis in cell - expressing neural glial antigen 2, a known molecular marker of pericytes in multiple organs. We found that pericytes in the brain synthesized EPO in mice with genetic HIF activation and were capable of responding to systemic hypoxia with the induction of Epo. Using high-resolution multiplex in situ hybridization, we determined that brain pericytes represent an important cellular source of Epo in the hypoxic brain (up to 70% of all Epo - expressing cells). We furthermore determined that Epo transcription in brain pericytes was HIF-2 dependent and cocontrolled by PHD2 and PHD3, oxygen - and 2-oxoglutarate -dependent prolyl-4-hydroxylases that regulate HIF activity. In summary, our studies provide experimental evidence that pericytes in the brain have the ability to function as oxygen sensors and respond to hypoxia with EPO synthesis. Our findings furthermore suggest that the ability to synthesize EPO may represent a functional feature of pericytes in the brain and kidney."}

A cross-sectional survey of inflammatory arthritis patients seen during a follow-up visit in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, was conducted over a ten-week period. Patient satisfaction was measured using a modified version of the validated Leeds Satisfaction Questionnaire, which uses a five-point Likert scale to measure six dimensions of satisfaction, and compared between the collaborative care and traditional physician models. A total of 62 patients completed the questionnaire (21 collaborative care and 41 traditional physician model). The average age of respondents was 52 years and the majority were female. The mean score for satisfaction across the six dimensions was 4.56 in the collaborative care group and 4.30 in the traditional physician group (p = 0.02). Patient satisfaction in the collaborative care group was consistently higher across all dimensions. No difference was noted between participants seen for the first time compared with those seen two or more times by the pharmacist.

Exposure-response models based on Metric I provided the highest predictive ability (72.3%) and goodness-of-fit, followed by IV, III and II. When compared to Metric I, Metric IV yielded the best results for exposure misclassification analysis and interpretation of health effect estimates, followed by Metric IIIb, IIIa and II.

We retrospectively analyzed the data of 623 patients who underwent radical nephrouretectomy for UTUC. Multivariate regression tests were performed to identify possible associations between adverse pathologic events and AST/ALT. The risk of postoperative progression and survival were tested using Kaplan-Meier analyses and Cox proportional hazards models. According to the receiver operator characteristic curve of AST/ALT for cancer-specific mortality, patients with AST/ALT value \u22651.5 were regarded as the high AST/ALT group, and the remaining patients formed the low AST/ALT group. In Kaplan-Meier analyses, the high AST/ALT group showed worse progression-free survival (PFS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (all P < .001).

Four POPC bilayer systems with different number of rofecoxib molecules were constructed to simulate different drug concentration. The free energy of rofecoxib passing across pure POPC bilayer has two minima (at z \u223c1.2nm or 1.6nm). As for the high concentration model, the minimum of the free energy profile slightly shifts to the bilayer center. Moreover, the energy change from bulk water to POPC bilayer increases while the central barrier to cross the hydrophobic core of bilayer slightly decreases, suggesting that increasing drug concentration makes it favorable for rofecoxib to partition into the bilayer and easier to pass across bialyer center. Energy analysis show that the stabilization between the selected rofecoxib and other pre-inserted rofecoxib molecule is mainly due to van der Waals interaction energy. The predicted permeability of rofecoxib in high concentration model slightly weakens as compared with low concentration model."}

Short-term variability of important markers of vitamin D metabolism is relatively unknown. A repeatability study was conducted in 160 Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study participants (60% female, 28% black, mean age 76 years). Fasting serum was drawn at 2 time points, a median of 6 (range 3-13) weeks apart. Vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] were measured by LC-MS, fibroblast growth factor (FGF23) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) by enzyme-linked immunoassay, and calcium and phosphorus by Roche Cobas 6000. Free and bioavailable 25(OH)D were calculated. We calculated the within-person CV (CVW), intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), Spearman rank correlation coefficient (r), and percent reclassified. The CVW was lowest for calcium (2.0%), albumin (3.6%), 25(OH)D (6.9%), VDBP (7.0%) and phosphorus (7.6%); intermediate for free 25(OH)D (9.0%) and bioavailable 25(OH)D (9.9%); and highest for PTH (16.7%) and FGF23 (17.8%). Reclassification was highest for PTH, VDBP, and phosphorus (all 7.5%). The ICC and r were highest (\u22650.80) for 25(OH)D, free 25(OH)D, bioavailable 25(OH)D and PTH, but somewhat lower (approximately 0.60-0.75) for the other biomarkers. Six- week short-term variability, as assessed by CVW, was quite low for VDBP, calcium and phosphorus, but fairly high for FGF23 and PTH. As such, multiple measurements of FGF23 and PTH may be needed to minimize misclassification. These results provide insight into the extent of potential misclassification of vitamin D markers in research and clinical settings."}

Periodontal tissue regeneration has therefore always been the ultimate goal of dentists and researchers. Existing fabrication methods mainly focused on a top-down tissue engineering strategy in which several drawbacks remain, including low throughput and limited diffusion properties resulting from a large sample size. Gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) is a kind of photocrosslinkable and biocompatible hydrogel, with the capacities of enabling cell encapsulation and regeneration of functional tissues. Here, we developed a novel method to fabricate GelMA / nanohydroxylapatite (nHA) microgel arrays using a photocrosslinkable strategy. The viability, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation and in vivo osteogenesis of human periodontal ligament stem cells (hPDLSCs) encapsulated in microgels were evaluated. The results suggested that such microgels provide great potential for periodontal tissue repair and regeneration. Microgel arrays were fabricated by blending different weight ratios of GelMA and nHA. hPDLSCs were encapsulated in GelMA / nHA microgels of various ratios for a systematic evaluation of cell viability, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation. In vivo osteogenesis in nude mice was also studied. The GelMA / nHA microgels exhibited appropriate microarchitecture, mechanical strength, and surface roughness, thus enabling cell adhesion and proliferation. Additionally, the GelMA / nHA microgels (10%/2% w/v) enhanced the osteogenic differentiation of hPDLSCs by elevating the expression levels of osteogenic biomarker genes, such as ALP, BSP, OCN, and RUNX2. In vivo ectopic transplantation results showed that GelMA / nHA microgels (10%/2% w/v) increased mineralized tissue formation with abundant vascularization, compared with the 1%, 3%, and the pure GelMA group. The GelMA / nHA microgels (10%/2% w/v) facilitated hPDLSCs viability, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation in vitro and further promoted new bone formation in vivo, suggesting that the GelMA / nHA microgels (10%/2% w/v) provide great potential for periodontal tissue regeneration."}

We enrolled 219 H. pylori - infected patients, and randomly allocated patients to the EAC group (esomeprazole 20 mg, clarithromycin 200 mg, amoxicillin 750 mg for one week, with all drugs given twice daily) or RAC group (rabeprazole 10 mg, clarithromycin 200 mg, amoxicillin 750 mg for one week, with all drugs given twice daily). The H. pylori eradication rate according to the PP analyses was 75.0% (95% CI: 65.2-82.8%) in the EAC group and 71.4% (95% CI: 61.4-79.1%) in the RAC group. There were no statistically significant differences. The eradication rates of the clarithromycin -resistant /- sensitive strains were, respectively, 45.0% (95% CI: 30.7-60.2%)/98.0% (95% CI: 88.7-100%) in the EAC group and 39.5% (95% CI: 25.6-55.3%)/93.5% (95% CI: 81.9-98.4%) in the RAC group. The eradication rate of the clarithromycin - sensitive strains was significantly higher than that of the resistant strains in both groups. In conclusion, EAC and RAC therapies show a comparable efficacy regardless of the CYP2C19 genotype and clarithromycin susceptibility status in Japan."}

Therefore, the early definition of therapeutic effects is urgently needed to guide cancer AAT. We aimed to optimize the early response monitoring and prediction of AAT efficacy, as indicated by the multi-targeted anti-angiogenic drug sunitinib in U87MG tumors, using noninvasive positron emission computed tomography (PET) molecular imaging strategies of multifactorial bioparameters. Methods: U87MG tumor mice were treated via intragastric injections of sunitinib (80 mg/kg) or vehicle for 7 consecutive days. Longitudinal MicroPET/CT scans with (18)F-FDG, (18)F-FMISO, (18)F-ML-10 and (18)F-Alfatide II were acquired to quantitatively measure metabolism, hypoxia, apoptosis and angiogenesis on days 0, 1, 3, 7 and 13 following therapy initiation. Tumor tissues from a dedicated group of mice were collected for immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of key biomarkers (Glut-1, CA-IX, TUNEL, \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23 and CD31) at the time points of PET imaging. The tumor sizes and mouse weights were measured throughout the study. The tumor uptake (ID%/gmax), the ratios of the tumor / muscle (T / M) for each probe, and the tumor growth ratios (TGR) were calculated and used for statistical analyses of the differences and correlations. Results: Sunitinib successfully inhibited U87MG tumor growth with significant differences in the tumor size from day 9 after sunitinib treatment compared with the control group (P < 0.01). The uptakes of (18)F-FMISO (reduced hypoxia), (18)F-ML-10 (increased apoptosis) and (18)F-Alfatide II (decreased angiogenesis) in the tumor lesions significantly changed during the early stage (days 1 to 3) of sunitinib treatment; however, the uptake of (18)F-FDG (increased glucose metabolism) was significantly different during the late stage. The PET imaging data of each probe were all confirmed via ex vivo IHC of the relevant biomarkers. Notably, the PET imaging of (18)F-Alfatide II and (18)F-FMISO was significantly correlated (all P < 0.05) with TGR, whereas the imaging of (18)F-FDG and (18)F-ML-10 was not significantly correlated with TGR. Conclusion: Based on the tumor uptake of the PET probes and their correlations with MVD and TGR, (18)F-Alfatide II PET may not only monitor the early response but also precisely predict the therapeutic efficacy of the multi-targeted, anti-angiogenic drug sunitinib in U87MG tumors. In conclusion, it is feasible to optimize the early response monitoring and efficacy prediction of cancer AAT using noninvasive PET molecular imaging strategies of multifactorial bioparameters, such as angiogenesis imaging with (18)F-Alfatide II, which represents an RGD -based probe."}

In Round 1, the research topics of 147 nurses were elicited using a modified nominal group technique as the consensus method. The number of participants in the 24 separate discussions ranged from 3 to 21, generating lists of between 6 and 23 topics. In Round 2, nurses from the clinical areas ranked topics of importance resulting in a set of four to five priorities. In Round 3, the divisional heads of nursing consulted with staff in all of their clinical areas to each finalize their five divisional priorities. The Nursing Research Working Group discussed and refined the divisions' priorities and voted on the final list to agree the top five research priorities for the organization. A total of 269 research topics were initially generated. Following three rounds of ranking and prioritizing, five priorities were agreed at Divisional level, and from these, the five top organizational priorities were selected. These were (i) understanding and improving all aspects of the patient journey through the hospital system; (ii) play; (iii) staff wellbeing, patient care and productivity; (iv) team work - linking to a more efficient service; and (v) supporting parents / parent pathway. Divisional priorities have been disseminated widely to clinical teams to inform a patient-specific nurse-led research agenda. Organizational priorities agreed upon have been disseminated through management structures and processes to ensure engagement at all levels. A subgroup of the Nursing Research Working Group has been delegated to take this work forward so that the agreed priorities continue to contribute towards shaping nurse-led research activity, thereby going some way to inform and embed an evidence-based culture of inquiry."}

The proposed learnable MGRF integrates two visual appearance sub-models with an adaptive lung shape submodel. The first-order appearance submodel accounts for both the original CT image and its Gaussian scale space (GSS) filtered version to specify local and global signal properties, respectively. Each empirical marginal probability distribution of signals is closely approximated with a linear combination of discrete Gaussians (LCDG), containing two positive dominant and multiple sign-alternate subordinate DGs. The approximation is separated into two LCDGs to describe individually the lungs and their background, i.e., all other chest tissues. The second-order appearance submodel quantifies conditional pairwise intensity dependencies in the nearest voxel 26-neighborhood in both the original and GSS-filtered images. The shape submodel is built for a set of training data and is adapted during segmentation using both the lung and chest appearances. The accuracy of the proposed segmentation framework is quantitatively assessed using two public databases (ISBI VESSEL12 challenge and MICCAI LOLA11 challenge) and our own database with, respectively, 20, 55, and 30 CT images of various lung pathologies acquired with different scanners and protocols. Quantitative assessment of our framework in terms of Dice similarity coefficients, 95-percentile bidirectional Hausdorff distances, and percentage volume differences confirms the high accuracy of our model on both our database (98.4\u00b11.0%, 2.2\u00b11.0 mm, 0.42\u00b10.10%) and the VESSEL12 database (99.0\u00b10.5%, 2.1\u00b11.6 mm, 0.39\u00b10.20%), respectively. Similarly, the accuracy of our approach is further verified via a blind evaluation by the organizers of the LOLA11 competition, where an average overlap of 98.0% with the expert's segmentation is yielded on all 55 subjects with our framework being ranked first among all the state-of-the-art techniques compared."}

To define the role of antioxidants in kidney protection during the development of diabetic nephropathy, we have generated a novel genetic antioxidant mouse model with over- or under-expression of lipoic acid synthase gene (Lias). These models have been mated with Ins2Akita/+ mice, a type I diabetic mouse model. We compare the major pathologic changes and oxidative stress status in two new strains of the mice with controls. Our results show that Ins2Akita/+ mice with under-expressed Lias gene, exhibit higher oxidative stress and more severe DN features (albuminuria, glomerular basement membrane thickening and mesangial matrix expansion). In contrast, Ins2Akita/+ mice with highly - expressed Lias gene display lower oxidative stress and less DN pathologic changes.

A total of 133 bands were obtained using nine selected ISSR primers, 129 (96.99%) of which were polymorphic; 267 bands were amplified by four AFLP primer pairs, 251 (94.01%) of which exhibited polymorphism. Based on these polymorphic products, a cluster analysis revealed similarities between the results of the ISSR and AFLP. All of the cultivars were clustered into two major branches; one branch contained the same four cultivars, and the other cultivars were separated into different groups in the other branch. The cluster results showed that the genetic relationships of the 17 cultivars were partly related to their morphological characteristics, particularly the flowering phase. Therefore, the results of this study support the classification of Rhododendron cultivars according to flowering phase. In addition, the cluster results can be used to select suitable parents for breeding."}
{"document_id": "27707812", "text": "Spontaneous activity is correlated with coding density in primary auditory cortex Sensory neurons across sensory modalities and specific processing areas have diverse levels of spontaneous firing rates (SFRs) in the absence of sensory stimuli. However, the functional significance of this spontaneous activity is not well-understood. Previous studies in the auditory system have demonstrated that different levels of spontaneous activity are correlated with a variety of physiological and anatomic properties, suggesting that neurons with differing SFRs make unique contributions to the encoding of auditory stimuli. Additionally, altered SFRs are a correlate of tinnitus, arising in several auditory areas after exposure to ototoxic substances and noise trauma. In this study, we recorded single-unit activity from primary auditory cortex of awake marmoset monkeys while delivering wide-band random-spectrum stimuli and white Gaussian noise (WGN) to examine any divergences in stimulus encoding properties across SFR classes. We found that higher levels of spontaneous activity were associated with both higher levels of activation relative to suppression across a variety of wide-band stimuli and higher driven rates in response to WGN. Moreover, response latencies to WGN were negatively correlated with the level of activation in response to both stimulus types. These findings are consistent with a novel view of the role spontaneous spiking may play during normal stimulus processing in primary auditory cortex and how it may malfunction in cases of tinnitus."}

We assess >1 megabase of sequence in the vicinity of two essential transcription factors, MYC and GATA1, and identify nine distal enhancers that control gene expression and cellular proliferation. Quantitative features of chromatin state and chromosome conformation distinguish the seven enhancers that regulate MYC from other elements that do not, suggesting a strategy for predicting enhancer - promoter connectivity. This CRISPRi -based approach can be applied to dissect transcriptional networks and interpret the contributions of noncoding genetic variation to human disease."}

A large amount of studies focused on the promotion of the growth of SCs for cell based therapy. Gastrodin (GAS), the main constituent of a Chinese traditional herbal medicine named Gastrodia elata Blume, has been reported to be associated with neuroprotective properties. Besides, GAS activated MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways which are often involved in growth of nerve cells were also reported. Based on the hypothesis that GAS may have an effect on SCs growth, we studied the effect of GAS on rat RSC96 Schwann cells (SCs) and further explored the underlying mechanism. Various concentration of GAS (0\u03bcM, 50\u03bcM, 100\u03bcM, and 200\u03bcM) was used for treatment of RSC96 SCs, with the cell proliferation and gene expression of several neurotrophic factors to be detected. Regulation of MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways were assayed by detecting phosphorylation of ERK1 / 2 and Akt. The results showed that GAS could effectively promote proliferation of RSC96 SCs in a dose - and time -dependent manner. The best performance was obtained at the concentration of 200\u03bcM. Exploration of the underlying mechanism showed that GAS probably affects SCs metabolism through inhibiting ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation and activating Akt phosphorylation in RSC96 SCs. This study may provide reference for its application in treatment of peripheral nerve injuries."}

Treatment options for people infected with A(H7N9) include the use of neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors. However, like other influenza viruses, A(H7N9) can become resistant to these drugs. The use of monoclonal antibodies is a rapidly developing strategy for controlling influenza virus infection. Here we generated a murine monoclonal antibody (3c10-3) directed against the NA of A(H7N9) and show that prophylactic systemic administration of 3c10-3 fully protected mice from lethal challenge with wild-type A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9). Further, post- infection treatment with a single systemic dose of 3c10-3 at either 24, 48 or 72 h post A(H7N9) challenge resulted in both dose - and time - dependent protection of up to 100% of mice, demonstrating therapeutic potential for 3c10-3. Epitope mapping revealed that 3c10-3 binds near the enzyme active site of NA, and functional characterization showed that 3c10-3 inhibits the enzyme activity of NA and restricts the cell -to- cell spread of the virus in cultured cells. Affinity analysis also revealed that 3c10-3 binds equally well to recombinant NA of wild-type A/Anhui/1/2013 and to a variant NA carrying a R289K mutation known to infer NAI resistance. These results suggest that 3c10-3 has the potential to be used as a therapeutic to treat A(H7N9) infections either as an alternative to, or in combination with, current NA antiviral inhibitors."}

The aim of this article is to provide an overview of the type of injuries and applied reconstructive techniques in a large academic hospital in The Netherlands. A retrospective chart review was conducted for the last 105 patients who underwent auricular reconstruction for an acquired deformity. Data concerning gender, affected side, cause of injury, anatomical region, the previous and further surgeries, type of cartilage, and skin cover used were collected and analyzed. 105 patients were included. Acquired auricular deformities were mainly caused by bite injuries (22 %), traffic accidents (17 %), burns (9.5 %), and post-otoplasty complications (9.5 %). The upper third of the auricle was most often injured (41 %), followed by the entire auricle (19 %). 70 % of cases required reconstruction with costal cartilage. The most common form of cutaneous cover was a postauricular skin flap (40 % of cases). This study gives a complete overview of causes and treatment of acquired auricular deformities. The results are comparable with the results of similar studies found in literature. Bite wounds are the leading cause of acquired auricular injuries. The upper third is most commonly affected.

With forecasts that future pathogen emergence will be centred in hotspots in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the need to prepare policy frameworks that can combat this threat is urgent. Emergence of diseases such as avian influenza and Ebola virus disease, which threatened social disruption, have established the need for intersectoral coordination/collaboration. These events led to the initiation of establishing institutionalised collaborative frameworks in India to adopt a One Health approach to disease prevention and control. However, the gains made in influenza control could not be adapted to other infectious diseases. Intersectoral coordination was briefly carried out, more as a reactive response to threats. The systemic failure to sustain such efforts have therefore, only undermined a coordinated response. The recent draft National Health Policy, 2015, has also failed to establish the need for intersectoral coordination in disease control approaches. Neglecting the need to endorse linkages between human health, animal health and husbandry, agriculture, and environmental sectors, has led to duplicative and weak response systems. The absence of health impact assessment with respect to the development agenda in policies, has cast negative effects on the health and wellbeing of man, animal, and the environment. Lack of attention to building core capacity in these critical sectors has further raised challenges in designing and deploying mitigation strategies. With developing countries like India being home to a major portion of the world's poorest livestock farmers, the absence of a policy discourse that endorses the One Health approach in development and health policies is a major hurdle in eliminating poverty and poverty - related diseases. The adoption of One Health approaches in health and related sectoral policies is a critical policy requirement for India and other developing countries. The goal should be to not just establish preparedness plans, but also to encourage a policy environment where assessment and mitigation of downstream impacts of different agenda are incorporated."}

A secondary purpose was to further validate the WARPS/STAID classification with the Banff Patella Instability Instrument (BPII), the Marx activity scale and the Patellar Instability Severity Score (ISS). A convenience sample of 50 patients with recurrent patellofemoral instability, including 25 WARPS and 25 STAID subtype patients, were assessed. Clinical data were collected including assessment of demographic risk factors (sex, BMI, bilaterality of symptoms, affected limb side and age at first dislocation) and pathoanatomic risk factors (TT-TG distance, patella height, patellar tilt, grade of trochlear dysplasia, Beighton score and rotational abnormalities of the tibia or femur). Patients completed the BPII and the Marx activity scale. The ISS was calculated from the clinical assessment data. Patients were stratified into the WARPS or STAID subtypes for comparative analysis. An independent t test was used to compare demographics, the pathoanatomic risk factors and subjective measures between the groups. Convergent validity was tested with a Pearson r correlation coefficient between the WARPS/STAID and ISS scores. Demographic risk factors statistically associated with a WARPS subtype included female sex, age at first dislocation and bilaterality. Pathoanatomic risk factors statistically associated with a WARPS subtype included trochlear dysplasia, TT-TG distance, generalized ligamentous laxity, patellar tilt and rotational abnormalities. The independent t test revealed a significant difference between the ISS scores: WARPS subtype (M = 4.4, SD = 1.1) and STAID subtype (M = 2.5, SD = 1.5); t(48) = 5.2, p < 0.001. The relationship between the WARPS/STAID and the ISS scores, measured using a Pearson r correlation coefficient, demonstrated a strong relationship: r = -0.61, n = 50, p < 0.001. This study has demonstrated statistically significant evidence that certain demographics and pathoanatomies are more prevalent in each of the WARPS and STAID patellofemoral instability subtypes. There was no difference in quality-of-life or activity level between the subtypes. The WARPS/STAID score demonstrated convergent validity to the ISS and divergent validity to the BPII score and the Marx activity scale. This study has further validated both the WARPS/STAID classification and the ISS of patients that present with recurrent patellofemoral instability. III."}

Results demonstrated that: (1) the follicle cells expressed a caspase of the 3/7 group and the mRNA for caspase 3 was transcribed in the stem phase and was completely translated during cell differentiation; (2) the proform protein was stored during the differentiated (nurse) stage and activated at the end of previtellogenesis provoking the degeneration of cells; (3) the predicted protein sequence, although partial, had a strong similarity with the known reptilian caspases 3. The epithelial cells of the ovarian follicle, therefore, do not employ caspase 3 during the nurse stage but, instead, prepare for apoptosis long before the process actually begins. The relevance of this strategy is discussed."}

However, on meta-analysis, the addition of chemotherapy did not improve survival for patients >70 years. We hypothesized that elderly patients treated with CRT would have increased toxicity without similar improvements in survival. A single-institution, IRB-approved retrospective study took place from 2005 to 2012 including 369 patients treated with CRT for LAHNC. Multivariate models for death at 3 months and death over time were developed using logistic regression and Cox modeling, respectively. Patients \u226570 years were treated less often with concurrent cisplatin dosed every 3 weeks (25.5% vs. 71.4%, respectively) and more often with weekly carboplatin (31.9% vs. 3.4%) than patients <70 years (n=322; p<0.001). Patients \u226570 years experienced increased toxicity during treatment with more frequently hospitalizations (36.2% vs. 21.1%; p=0.02) and a lower rate of PEG removal at last follow-up or death (77.1% vs. 92.9%; p=0.004). A higher proportion of patients \u226570 years died within 3 months (12.8% vs. 2.8%; p=0.001) following CRT. Patients \u226570 had an increased risk of death at 3 months following CRT (odds ratio 5.19, 95% CI 1.64-16.41; p=0.005) and worse survival over time (hazard ratio 2.30, 95% CI 1.34-3.93; p=0.002). Patients \u226570 years were more often treated with less toxic chemotherapy, yet experienced higher rates of hospitalization during treatment and increased rates of acute mortality following CRT.

Faecal bacteria can then penetrate the skin, increasing the risk of secondary infection. However, IAD can be prevented and healed with timely and appropriate skin cleansing and skin protection. This includes appropriate use of containment devices.

To investigate the feasibility of a transition intervention aimed at adolescents with chronic illness focusing on declines, drop-outs, no-shows and advantages and disadvantages of participating. We invited 236 adolescents (12-20 years) with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) to participate in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) transition intervention. Reasons for decline and drop-outs were calculated. Adolescents ' experiences of advantages and disadvantages of participating and reasons for no-shows were investigated through focus groups and telephone interviews, which were analysed using thematic analysis. One hundred and twenty of the 236 eligible patients declined to participate in the intervention and 20% dropped out during the intervention. Unspecified declines and practical issues were the most common reason to decline, and ' do not wish to continue ' was the most common reason to drop-out. Reasons for no-shows were forgetting and being too busy. Advantages of participating were stated as ' participating without parents ', ' trust and confidentiality ', 'being able to set the agenda ' and ' responsiveness '. Disadvantages were ' unclear aim of the study ', 'meeting others with JIA ', 'too few conversations ' and ' transport issues '. Many adolescents had difficulties understanding the aim of the intervention. However, most participants appreciated the conversations about identity as well as the trust and confidentiality in the communication. In the future, adolescents should be offered more individually organised programmes according to their preferences and needs in cooperation with parents and health care providers."}

Glycans attached to immunoglobulin G (IgG) were shown to be essential for its function and IgG glycosylation was shown to change with various processes, making IgG one of the most studied glycoproteins. Many approaches including liquid chromatography, capillary gel electrophoresis, and mass spectrometry were developed to study IgG glycosylation. Generation of high-quality glycomics data in a high-throughput fashion requires reproducible and robust sample preparation and accurate and reliable quantitative analysis.

Despite previous achievements in understanding complicated signaling pathways between cells and bone extracellular matrices during bone remodeling process, a role of local ionic concentration remains to be elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that synthetic whitlockite (WH: Ca18Mg2(HPO4)2(PO4)12) nanoparticles can recapitulate early-stage of bone regeneration through stimulating osteogenic differentiation, prohibiting osteoclastic activity, and transforming into mechanically enhanced hydroxyapatite (HAP)- neo bone tissues by continuous supply of PO4(3-) and Mg(2+) under physiological conditions. In addition, based on their structural analysis, the dynamic phase transformation from WH into HAP contributed as a key factor for rapid bone regeneration with denser hierarchical neo-bone structure. Our findings suggest a groundbreaking concept of ' living bone minerals ' that actively communicate with the surrounding system to induce self-healing, while previous notions about bone minerals have been limited to passive products of cellular mineralization."}

Demineralized dentin beams (1\u00d72\u00d76mm, n=10/group) were treated with (1) 1% glutaraldehyde (GA1), (2) 5% glutaraldehyde (GA5), (3) 1% grape seed extract (GS1), (4) 5% grape seed extract (GS5), (5) 10% sumac berry extract (S), (6) 20\u03bcM curcumin (CR20), and (7) 200\u03bcM curcumin (CR200) for 5min. Untreated beams served as control. The beams were incubated up to 6 months and incubation media were used to analyze solubilized telopeptide (ICTP and CTX) fragments as indicators of MMP - and cathepsin K -mediated degradation after 1, 3 and 6 months of incubation. The relative MMP activity of dentin beams was tested using a generic MMP assay. Data were analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVA, \u03b1=0.05.

STEP normally opposes synaptic strengthening by increasing N-methyl D-aspartate glutamate receptor (NMDAR) internalization through dephosphorylation of GluN2B and inactivation of the kinases extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 / 2 and Fyn. Here we show that STEP61 is elevated in the cortex in the Nrg1(+/-) knockout mouse model of schizophrenia (SZ). Genetic reduction or pharmacological inhibition of STEP prevents the loss of NMDARs from synaptic membranes and reverses behavioral deficits in Nrg1(+/-) mice. STEP61 protein is also increased in cortical lysates from the central nervous system - specific ErbB2 / 4 mouse model of SZ, as well as in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived forebrain neurons and Ngn2 - induced excitatory neurons, from two independent SZ patient cohorts. In these selected SZ models, increased STEP61 protein levels likely reflect reduced ubiquitination and degradation.

We found that incident fractures were associated with an increased risk of death even after adjusting for pre-fracture frailty status as represented by physical performance tests and laboratory tests for common geriatric diseases in community-dwelling elderly Japanese men. While fractures reportedly increase the risk of mortality, frailty may complicate this association, generating a false-positive result. We evaluated this association after adjusting for pre-fracture levels of frailty. We examined 1998 community-dwelling ambulatory men aged \u226565 years at baseline in the Fujiwara-kyo Osteoporosis Risk in Men Study for frailty status as represented by activities of daily living (ADL), physical performance tests (grip strength, one-foot standing balance with eyes open, timed 10-m walk), and laboratory sera tests. Participants were then followed for 5 years for incident clinical fractures and death. Effects of incident fracture on death were determined by Cox proportional hazards model with the first fracture during follow-up as a time-dependent predictor and with frailty status indices as covariates. We identified 111 fractures in 99 men and 138 deaths during the follow-up period (median follow-up, 4.5 years). Participants with incident fractures did not have significantly worse frailty statuses, but did show a significantly higher cumulative mortality rate than those without fractures (p = 0.0047). Age-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of death for incident fracture was 3.57 (95 % confidence interval: 2.05, 6.24). When adjusted for physical performance, this decreased to 2.77 (1.51, 5.06), but remained significant. The HR showed no significant change when adjusted for laboratory test results (3.96 (2.26, 6.94)). Exclusion of deaths within the first 24 months of follow-up did not alter these results. Incident clinical fracture was associated with an elevated risk of death independently of pre-fracture levels of frailty in community-dwelling elderly men."}

Progress in the improvement of short-term and long-term outcomes of kidney transplantation seems to have reached a plateau, partially due to consequences of very efficient, but nonspecific immunosuppressive drugs. In recent years, various forms of cell therapy, including the use of mesenchymal stromal cells, have been put forward as an alternative strategy for more defined therapy. It is thought that these therapies will not only allow controlled tapering of immunosuppressive medication, but might bring us also closer to the ambition of generating donor -specific immune regulation and tolerance. Different forms of alloimmunity, including direct, indirect and semi-direct alloantigen presentation have to be controlled before donor -specific immune regulation can be reached. Several mechanisms have been described how mesenchymal stromal cells can affect alloimmunity. Especially, the interaction with professional antigen presenting cells, like dendritic cells, is of critical importance. This review will discuss the current status of ongoing clinical trials with mesenchymal stromal cells in kidney transplantation and specifically concentrate on the possibilities and impossibilities of how these therapeutic strategies can contribute to control of the different forms of alloreactivity operation in organ transplantation."}

Utilization of research is an intricate process requiring an understanding of contextual factors. The study was conducted to assess enhancing factors and barriers of research utilization for malaria policy development in Malawi. Qualitative research approach was used through in-depth interviews with 39 key informants that included malaria researchers, policy makers, programme managers, and key stakeholders. Purposive sampling and snowballing techniques were used in identifying key informants. Interview transcripts were entered in QSR Nvivo 11 software for coding and analysis. Respondents identified global efforts as key in advancing knowledge translation, while local political will has been conducive for research utilization. Other factors were availability of research, availability of diverse local researchers and stakeholders supporting knowledge translation. While barriers included: lack of platforms for researcher - public engagement, politics, researchers' lack of communication skills, lack of research collaborations, funder driven research, unknown World Health Organization policy position, and the lack of a malaria research repository. Overall, the study identified facilitating factors to malaria research utilization for policy development in Malawi. These factors need to be systematically coordinated to address the identified barriers and improve on malaria research utilization in policy development. Malaria research can be key in the implementation of evidence-based interventions to reduce the malaria burden and assist in the paradigm shift from malaria control to elimination in Malawi."}

Nineteen patients with schizophrenia and 18 healthy controls underwent high-resolution PET and MRI. The binding potential (BPND) of [(11)C]DASB and standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) of [(18)F]FDG were obtained. In SERT availability, the region of interest (ROI)-based analyses showed no significant group differences in any region, except for the anterior hippocampus where the SERT availability was lower in patients with schizophrenia than in controls. The ROI - and voxel -based analyses revealed that the [(18)F]FDG SUVR values were significantly lower in patients than in controls in the right superior frontal gyrus and medial part of the left superior frontal gyrus. Regarding the interregional correlations of [(11)C]DASB BPND with [(18)F]FDG SUVR, more widespread positive correlations across the brain regions were observed in control subjects than in patients with schizophrenia. Notably, the patients and control subjects showed statistically significant differences in correlations between the SERT availability in the parietal and temporal cortices and the glucose metabolism in the posterior cingulate cortex. These results suggest abnormal functional connectivity between the higher-order cortical regions in schizophrenia and a possible important role of the posterior cingulate gyrus and its related circuitry in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia."}

Calculations based on the minimum inhibitory concentrations and MPCs showed that clindamycin has the lowest MSW against both P. acnes and S. aureus. Nadifloxacin MSWs were 4-fold higher against P. acnes than against S. aureus. It is more likely for P. acnes to acquire resistance to fluoroquinolones than S. aureus.

Therefore, we studied strain BXF1 effect in pine wilt disease. We found that strain BXF1 promoted in vitro nematode reproduction. Moreover, the presence of bacteria led to the absence of nematode chitinase gene (Bxcht-1) expression, suggesting an effect for bacterial chitinase in nematode reproduction. Nevertheless, strain BXF1 was unable to colonize the nematode interior, bind to its cuticle with high affinity or protect the nematode from xenobiotic stress. Interestingly, strain BXF1 was able to promote tomato and pine plant-growth, as well as to colonize its interior, thus, acting like a plant-growth promoting endophyte. Consequently, strain BXF1 failed to induce wilting symptoms when inoculated in pine shoot artificial incisions. This bacterium also presented strong antagonistic activities against fungi and bacteria isolated from Pinus pinaster. Our results suggest that B. xylophilus does not possess a strict symbiotic community capable of inducing pine wilt disease symptoms as previously hypothesized.

We posit that any identified clusters could represent at-risk populations who could serve as high-yield targets for preventive medical interventions. This was a prospective observational surveillance study. Patients were screened with a previously derived clinical decision guideline that has a 90% sensitivity and 30% specificity for influenza. Patients received points for the following signs and symptoms within the past 7 days: cough (2 points), headache (1 point), subjective fever (1 point), and documented fever at triage (temperature >38\u00b0C [100.4\u00b0F]) (1 point). Patients scoring 3 points or higher were indicated for influenza testing. Patients were tested with Xpert Flu (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA), a rapid polymerase chain reaction test. Positive results were mapped with ArcGIS (ESRI, Redlands, CA) and analyzed with kernel density estimation to create heat maps. There were 1,360 patients tested with Xpert Flu with retrievable addresses within the greater Phoenix metro area. One hundred sixty-seven (12%) of them tested positive for influenza A and 23 (2%) tested positive for influenza B. The influenza A virus exhibited a clear cluster pattern within this patient population. The densest cluster was located in an approximately 1- square-mile region southeast of our hospital. Our layered-surveillance approach was effective in localizing a cluster of influenza A outbreak. This region may house a high-yield target population for public health intervention. Further collaborative efforts will be made between our hospital and the Maricopa County Department of Public Health to perform a series of community vaccination events before the next influenza season.

By targeting Pten in cerebellar granule cells and activating the AKT1 - mTOR pathway, we increased the caliber of normally unmyelinated axons and the expression of numerous genes encoding regulatory proteins. This led to the expansion of genetically wild-type oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, oligodendrocyte differentiation and de novo myelination of parallel fibers. Thus, a neuronal program dependent on the phosphoinositide PI(3,4,5)P3 is sufficient to trigger all steps of myelination."}

Microglia, the resident innate immune cells and sentinels in the brain, are a common source of neuroinflammation and are implicated in air pollution - induced CNS effects. While renewable energy, such as soy-based biofuel, is of increasing public interest, there is little information on how soy biofuel may affect the brain, especially in people with preexisting disease conditions. To address this, male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats were exposed to 100% Soy-based Biodiesel Exhaust (100SBDE; 0, 50, 150 and 500\u03bcg/m(3)) by inhalation, 4h/ day for 4 weeks (5 days / week). Ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule-1 (IBA-1) staining of microglia in the substantia nigra revealed significant changes in morphology with 100SBDE exposure in rats from both genotypes, where SHR were less sensitive. Aconitase activity was inhibited in the frontal cortex and cerebellum of WKY rats exposed to 100SBDE. No consistent changes occurred in pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, nitrated protein, or arginase1 expression in brain regions from either rat strain exposed to 100SBDE. However, while IBA-1 mRNA expression was not modified, CX3CR1 mRNA expression was lower in the striatum of 100SBDE exposed rats regardless of genotype, suggesting a downregulation of the fractalkine receptor on microglia in this brain region. Together, these data indicate that while microglia are detecting and responding to 100SBDE exposure with changes in morphology, there is reduced expression of CX3CR1 regardless of genetic background and the activation response is atypical without traditional inflammatory markers of M1 or M2 activation in the brain."}

Since obesity is highly influenced by genetics, and adipose tissue renin-angiotensin system is over-activated in obesity, the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism on obesity and related disorders was studied in several populations, because of its effect on ACE activity. Our objective was to study the association of ACE I/D polymorphism with obesity and certain related disorders, namely hypertension, insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, in Egyptian females. Eighty female volunteers were recruited, blood pressure and body measurements were recorded and a fasting blood sample was obtained for the quantitation of glucose, lipid profile, insulin, leptin and identification of ACE I/D polymorphs. Subjects were grouped based on hypertension and obesity states. Comparisons of continuous parameters were made with independent sample t-test between two groups. The frequencies of ACE genotypes and alleles, and the association between gene polymorphism and metabolic parameters were assessed using chi-square or Fisher's exact test. Genotype frequencies were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for all groups. Genotype distribution did not differ significantly between controls and cases of all the studied disorders. Although DD carriers had apparently higher parameters of blood pressure, lipid profile and insulin resistance, only diastolic blood pressure was almost significant (p = 0.057). I-carriers were significantly less susceptible to hypertension than DD carriers having normal waist/hip ratio (p = 0.007, OR = 17.29, CI = 1.81-164.96) and normal conicity index (p = 0.024, OR = 7.00, CI = 1.36-35.93). In DD genotype carriers, a significant association was found between insulin resistance and high body mass index (p = 0.004, OR = 8.89, CI = 1.94-40.71), waist circumference (p = 0.003, OR = 9.63, CI = 2.14-43.36) and waist/height ratio (p = 0.034, OR = 6.86, CI = 1.25-37.61), although the variations in percentages between DD and I-carriers were not high enough to conclude an effect of ACE I/D on such an association. In this sample of Egyptian females, ACE I/D polymorphism was not significantly associated with obesity nor with any of its related disorders studied. The I allele seemed protective against hypertension in subjects with normal, not high, waist/hip ratio and conicity index compared to DD genotype carriers."}

Tissue miRNA expression studies have discovered a myriad of functions for miRNAs in various aspects, but a role for miRNAs in chicken ovarian tissue at 300 days of age has not hitherto been reported. In this study, we performed the first miRNA analysis of ovarian tissues in chickens with low and high rates of egg production using high-throughput sequencing. By comparing low rate of egg production chickens with high rate of egg production chickens, 17 significantly differentially expressed miRNAs were found (P < 0.05), including 11 known and six novel miRNAs. We found that all 11 known miRNAs were involved mainly in pathways of reproduction regulation, such as steroid hormone biosynthesis and dopaminergic synapse. Additionally, expression profiling of six randomly selected differentially regulated miRNAs were validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Some miRNAs, such as gga-miR-34b, gga-miR-34c and gga-miR-216b, were reported to regulate processes such as proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis and metastasis and were expressed differentially in ovaries of chickens with high rates of egg production, suggesting that these miRNAs have an important role in ovary development and reproductive management of chicken. Furthermore, we uncovered that a significantly up-regulated miRNA - gga-miR-200a-3p -is ubiquitous in reproduction - regulation -related pathways. This miRNA may play a special central role in the reproductive management of chicken, and needs to be further studied for confirmation."}

We sought to determine how the relationship between cigarette use and fetal growth is modified by the social and physical environment. Birth records with covariates were obtained from the BC Perinatal Database Registry (N = 232,291). Maternal smoking status was self-reported as the number of cigarettes smoked per day usually at the first prenatal care visit. Census dissemination areas (DAs) were used as neighbourhood - level units and linked to individual births using residential postal codes to assign exposure to particulate air pollution (PM2.5) and neighbourhood - level attributes such as socioeconomic status (SES), proportion of post-secondary education, immigrant density and living in a rural place. Random coefficient models were used with cigarettes /day modeled with a random slope to estimate its between- DA variability and test cross-level interactions with the neighbourhood - level variables on continuous birth weight. A significant negative and non-linear association was found between maternal smoking and birth weight. There was significant between- DA intercept variability in birth weight as well as between- DA slope variability of maternal smoking on birth weight of which 68 and 30 % respectively was explained with the inclusion of DA - level variables and their cross-level interactions. High DA - level SES had a strong positive association with birth weight but the effect was moderated with increased cigarettes /day. Conversely, heavy smokers showed the largest increases in birth weight with rising neighbourhood education levels. Increased levels of PM2.5 and immigrant density were negatively associated with birth weight, but showed positive interactions with increased levels of smoking. Older maternal age and suspected drug or alcohol use both had negative interactions with increased levels of maternal smoking. Maternal smoking had a negative and non-linear dose-response association with birth weight which was highly variable between neighbourhood s and evidence of effect modification with neighbourhood - level factors. These results suggest that focusing exclusively on individual behaviours may have limited success in improving outcomes without addressing the contextual influences at the neighbourhood - level. Further studies are needed to corroborate our findings and to understand how neighbourhood - level attributes interact with smoking to affect birth outcomes."}

Twenty six participants (13 young aged 18-30; 13 old aged 70-80) were recruited. COT (O2/kg body mass/km) was calculated by standardizing the mean oxygen consumption recorded during steady state walking. Electromyography signals from 10 leg muscles were used to calculate the cumulative activity required to traverse a unit of distance (CMAPD) for each muscle at each speed. In the old group CMAPD was correlated with COT, presented higher and more variable values, and showed greater increases around optimal speed for all studied muscles. Soleus CMAPD was independent of speed in the young group, but this was not evident with aging. Greater energy cost of walking in older individuals seems to be attributable to increased energy cost of all lower limb muscles."}

To evaluate the correlation between HbA1c level and severity of CAD in non-diabetic patients using SYNTAX score in a cohort of proven CAD on angiography at Gauhati Medical College, Guwahati, Assam, India, which is a major tertiary care hospital of North-Eastern India. We prospectively collected data of non-diabetic patients with proven CAD on angiography from June 2014 to June 2015. Patients were divided into four groups (interquartiles) according to HbA1c levels, less than 4.8%, 4.8% to 5.1%, 5.1% to 5.6%, and 5.6% to 6.5%. Severity of CAD was assessed using SYNTAX score and the number of coronary vessels diseased. We compared different quartiles of HbA1c with regard to SYNTAX score and number of diseased vessels. A total of 346 patients were included in the study. Mean age was 58.1\u00b110.4 years. Of the total 91.9% (318) were males, 44.8% (155) were hypertensives, 29.2% (101) were smokers and 34.7% (120) were dyslipidemic. We found that CAD severity by SYNTAX score as well as number of vessels involved was significantly different among quartiles (p-values <0.001 and <0.001 respectively). Increase in HbA1c level was strongly correlated with disease severity and higher SYNTAX score. A significant increase was noted in the mean number of diseased vessels (p-value <0.001) as HbA1c level increases. Age, gender, hypertension and dyslipidemia did not show significant difference among quartiles however smoking was found to be an independent predictor of severity of CAD by SYNTAX score (p <0.05). From this clinical study, we can conclude that a significant correlation exists between HbA1c and severity of CAD by SYNTAX score as well as number of vessels involved in non- diabetes."}

Clarification of this issue can have important theoretical implications as face recognition is often used as a prime example of domain - specificity in mind and brain. An important source of input to this debate comes from studies of individuals with developmental prosopagnosia, suggesting that face recognition can be selectively impaired. We put the selectivity hypothesis to test by assessing the performance of 10 individuals with developmental prosopagnosia on demanding tests of visual object processing involving both regular and degraded drawings. None of the individuals exhibited a clear dissociation between face and object recognition, and as a group they were significantly more affected by degradation of objects than control participants. Importantly, we also find positive correlations between the severity of the face recognition impairment and the degree of impaired performance with degraded objects. This suggests that the face and object deficits are systematically related rather than coincidental. We conclude that at present, there is no strong evidence in the literature on developmental prosopagnosia supporting domain - specific accounts of face recognition."}

However, its impact on chest and abdominal wall mobility is unknown. This study aimed to ascertain the prevalence of patients with COPD with reduced chest and abdominal wall mobility and to investigate the effect of reduced chest and abdominal wall mobility on pulmonary function, respiratory muscle strength, and exercise capacity. In 51 elderly male subjects with COPD, chest and abdominal wall mobility, FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC, maximal inspiratory pressure (PImax), maximal expiratory pressure (PEmax), and the 6-min walk distance (6MWD) were assessed. Chest and abdominal wall mobility were measured using the breathing movement scale (0-8) at the 3 regions (upper chest, lower chest, and abdomen). Reduced mobility was defined as a value lower than the lower limit of the normal scale. The unpaired t test, Mann-Whitney test, and multiple regression analysis were performed. The percentages of subjects with reduced mobility were 78% for the upper chest, 76% for the lower chest, and 53% for the abdomen. The subjects with reduced mobility had significantly low FVC, FEV1, and 6MWD in each region and significantly low FEV1/FVC, PImax, and PEmax in the abdominal region compared with those with nonreduced mobility. FVC and 6MWD were independently associated with the scale values in each region and with the abdominal scale value, respectively. The majority of subjects with COPD had reduced chest and abdominal wall mobility, which was independently associated with FVC. Even though abdominal wall mobility was relatively preserved compared with chest wall mobility, it was also independently associated with 6MWD."}

The rats were divided and treated: [1] saline (Control), [2] LPS (1mg/kg), [3-5] 10, 50 or 100mg/kg captopril 30min before LPS. The treatment was started since six days before the behavioral experiments and continued during the behavioral tests (LPS injection two h before each behavioral experiment). Administration of LPS prolonged the escape latency and traveled path to find the platform in Morris water maze (MWM) test (P<0.01-P<0.001) while, shortened the latency to enter the dark compartment in passive avoidance (PA) test (P<0.001). Pretreatment by all doses of captopril improved performances of the rats in MWM (P<0.05-P<0.001) and also prolonged the latency to enter the dark in PA test (P<0.001).

These receptors acquire iron either in concert with soluble iron-scavenging siderophores or through direct interaction and extraction from host proteins. Characterization of these receptors provides invaluable insight into pathogenesis. However, only a subset of virulence -related TonB -dependent receptors have been currently described. Here we report the discovery of FusA, a new class of TonB -dependent receptor, which is utilized by phytopathogenic Pectobacterium spp. to obtain iron from plant ferredoxin.

We sought to dissect the effect on antigenicity of each step of processing by using frozen sections as proxies of the whole tissue. An equivalent extent of antigen masking occurs across variable fixation times at room temperature. Most antigens benefit from longer fixation times (>24 hr) for optimal detection after antigen retrieval (AR; for example, Ki-67, bcl-2, ER). The transfer to a graded alcohol series results in an enhanced staining effect, reproduced by treating the sections with detergents, possibly because of a better access of the polymeric immunohistochemical detection system to tissue structures. A second round of masking occurs upon entering the clearing agent, mostly at the paraffin embedding step. This may depend on the non-freezable water removal. AR fully reverses the masking due both to the fixation time and the paraffin embedding. AR itself destroys some epitopes which do not survive routine processing. Processed frozen sections are a tool to investigate fixation and processing requirements for antigens in routine specimens."}

One hundred and eighteen patients received EBRT in 23 fractions of 2 Gy and HDR (TG43 algorithm) in 3 fractions of 6.5 Gy. Results for the Late Effects of Normal Tissues - Subjective, Objective, Management and Analytic toxicity assessments were available with a median follow-up of 72 months. The HDR CT was deformably-registered to the EBRT CT. Doses were corrected for dose fractionation. Rectum dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters were calculated in two ways. (1) Distribution-adding: parameters were calculated after the EBRT dose distribution was 3D-summed with the registered HDR dose distribution. (2) Parameter-adding: the EBRT DVH parameters were added to HDR DVH parameters. Logistic regressions and Mann-Whitney U-tests were used to correlate parameters with late peak toxicity (dichotomised at grade 1 or 2). The 48-80, 40-63 and 49-55 Gy dose regions from distribution-adding were significantly correlated with rectal bleeding, urgency / tenesmus and stool frequency respectively. Additionally, urgency / tenesmus and anorectal pain were associated with the 25-26 Gy and 44-48 Gy dose regions from distribution-adding respectively. Parameter-adding also indicated the low - mid dose region was significantly correlated with stool frequency and proctitis. This study confirms significant dose-histogram effects for gastrointestinal toxicities after including deformable registration to combine phases of EBRT / HDR prostate cancer treatment. The findings from distribution-adding were in most cases consistent with those from parameter-adding. The mid - high dose range and near maximum doses were important for rectal bleeding.

This remodeling is characterized by aberrant accumulation of contractile myofibroblasts that deposit excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) and increase tissue stiffness. Studies demonstrate, however, that a stiff ECM itself promotes fibroblast -to- myofibroblast differentiation, stimulating further ECM production. This creates a positive feedback loop that perpetuates fibrosis. We hypothesized that simultaneously targeting myofibroblast contractility with relaxin and ECM stiffness with lysyl oxidase inhibitors could break the feedback loop, reversing established fibrosis. To test this, we used the orthotopic tracheal transplantation (OTT) mouse model, which develops robust fibrotic airway remodeling. Mice with established fibrosis were treated with saline, mono-, or combination therapies. Although monotherapies had no effect, combining these agents decreased collagen deposition and promoted re-epithelialization of remodeled airways. Relaxin inhibited myofibroblast differentiation and contraction in a matrix - stiffness - dependent manner through prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Furthermore, the effect of combination therapy was lost in PGE2 receptor knockout and PGE2 - inhibited OTT mice. This study revealed the important synergistic roles of cellular contractility and tissue stiffness in the maintenance of fibrotic tissue and suggests a new therapeutic principle for fibrosis."}

Data on the potential long-term health effects of chronic tonsillitis are limited. Many inflammatory conditions present with enhanced systemic matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-8 response. In head and neck cancer, high plasma level of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 predicts poor prognosis. We analyzed S-MMP-8 with immunofluorometric assay and S-TIMP-1 with an immunosorbent assay in 175 consecutive patients undergoing tonsillectomy for benign tonsillar disease, and in 33 control patients with tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma. Tonsillar human papillomavirus (HPV) status was determined by PCR. In patients with benign tonsillar disease, chronic tonsillitis without hypertrophy was associated with enhanced systemic MMP-8 response. Compared to patients with benign tonsillar disease, patients with tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma had significantly higher concentrations of S-MMP-8 and S-TIMP-1. Neither S-MMP-8 nor S-TIMP-1 correlated with tonsillar HPV positivity."}

A rigid glass ionomer post is created over which zirconia crowns can be fitted to achieve a long-term stable esthetic restoration for primary anterior teeth. Children aged 2-5 years with two up to six extensively decayed upper primary incisors were included. Fuji IX was condensed into an intracanal space created to a depth of 3mm, to provide a core which also extended 3mm supragingivally. Crown preparations were completed upon these cores. Zirconia crowns (Nusmile, Houston Texas USA) were fitted and cemented over the prepared cores. All patients were recalled at regular intervals. Twenty-three healthy children with 86 restorations participated in the study. The overall survival of the restorations was 95.3% after 12 months and 80.2% after 24 months. According to Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, the median survival time was not reached while the estimated mean survival time was 22.9 months. This newly described clinical technique is simple and reliable to use for restoration of extensively decayed primary incisors. Use of zirconia crowns retained using this technique offers superior esthetic, durable restorations with remarkable gingival response up to 24 months."}

Pretreatment with triamcinolone or clodronate liposomes improved luciferase expression over a period of 4 weeks. Similar results were seen when empty decoy capsids were added to full genome containing capsids in a 5:1 ratio. In a study to assess the duration of expression as well as to investigate the combination of these two approaches, we observed a synergistic enhancement of gene expression, sustained for at least 12 weeks. The enhancement of gene expression was independent of the route of administration of triamcinolone (intra-articular or intramuscular). In healthy mice it was demonstrated that the combination improved expression of the transgene significantly, in a serotype independent manner. These data have implications for future applications of gene therapy to the joint and for other tissues with an abundance of macrophages."}

However, the relative influence of cognitive and emotional brain circuits to the feeding circuitry in the hypothalamus and hindbrain remains unclear. Here, using the cell-type selectivity of genetic methods, circuit mapping, and behavior assays, we sought to decipher neural circuits emanating from the septal nucleus to the lateral hypothalamus (LH) that contribute to neural regulation of food intake in mice. We found that chemogenetic and optogenetic activation of septal vesicular GABA transporter (vGAT)- containing neurons or their projections in the LH reduced food intake in mice. Consistently, chemogenetic inhibition of septal vGAT neurons increased food intake. Furthermore, we investigated a previously unknown neural circuit originating from septal vGAT neurons to a subset of vGAT neurons in the LH, an area involved in homeostatic and hedonic control of energy states. Collectively, our data reveal an inhibitory septohypothalamic feeding circuit that might serve as a therapeutic target for the treatment of eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa. Our results demonstrate that top-down projections from the septum to the hypothalamus control food intake negatively. Given the known role for both of these brain regions in the control of feeding and emotion - related behaviors, these findings reveal previously unknown neural circuitry that is likely implicated in emotional aspects of food intake and provide new insights into the development of therapeutic targets for the treatment of eating disorders."}

Despite advances in early detection and treatment, it has the second highest mortality rate after lung cancer. Around 85% of breast carcinomas are ER+; thus, antiestrogens like tamoxifen are beneficial. Although, tamoxifen is useful for many patients, plenty of patients respond poorly to initial therapy or recurrence occurs in about 30% of cases, because tamoxifen resistance happens. Drug resistance remains a major clinical obstacle to successful treatment of breast cancer and more than 90% of unsuccessful treatments are because of acquired resistance and MultiDrug Resistance (MDR) is a major contributor. MicroRNAs are members of a novel class of short noncoding RNAs. Besides to their various roles in gene expression, miRNAs are considered as important cancer therapeutic targets and biomarkers. Since 2005, when miRNA deregulation was first reported in breast cancer, more than 1000 reports have been published about miRNAs. Increasing number of studies showed the importance of miRNAs in antiestrogen therapy, especially on tamoxifen; thus, it is not surprising that these tiny molecules are involved in drug resistance. Due to the pivotal role of these known RNA molecules, in this review, we tried to illustrate the importance of the miRNAs as a new player in breast cancer pathogenesis. We have also focused on cancer drug resistance mechanisms highlighting the role of important oncomirs, miR 221 / 222, involved in cell cycle deregulation in breast cancer. The relationship between these oncomiRs with resistance to tamoxifen is also emphasized."}

Here, we report that SL4 is able to inhibit the proliferation of different types of breast cancer cell in vitro and in vivo by inducing G2/M cell cycle arrest. Our results showed that SL4 exhibited strong anti-proliferative activity in several human breast cancer cell lines, with IC50 values lower than 1.3 \u03bcM. Further studies indicated that SL4 induced G2/M arrest in these cell lines. Mechanistically, SL4 reduces the expression of cyclin A2 and cdc25C and decreases the activity of the cdc2 / cyclin B1 complex. Notably, SL4 treatment resulted in an obvious increase in p21 mRNA and protein levels through activation of MAPK signaling pathways, but not the TGF-\u03b2 pathway. SP600125 and PD98059, specific inhibitors of JNK kinase and ERK kinase, significantly blocked the SL4 - induced G2/M phase arrest and upregulation of p21. Furthermore, SL4 suppressed the growth of established breast tumors in nude mice through upregulation of p21 and downregulation of cdc25C, and displayed a good safety profile. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the potential value of SL4 as a novel multi-target anti-tumor drug candidate."}

Seven wax compound classes were detected that had previously not been reported, and their structures were elucidated using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of various derivatives. Six of the classes were identified as series of homologs differing by two methylene units, while the seventh was a homologous series with homologs with single methylene unit differences. In the waxes of flag leaf blades, secondary alcohols (predominantly C27 and C33), primary / secondary diols (predominantly C28) and esters of primary / secondary diols (predominantly C50, combining C28 diol with C22 acid) were found, all sharing similar secondary hydroxyl group positions at and around C-12 or \u03c9-12. 7- and 8-hydroxy-2-alkanol esters (predominantly C35), 7- and 8-oxo-2-alkanol esters (predominantly C35), and 4-alkylbutan-4-olides (predominantly C28) were found both in flag leaf and peduncle wax mixtures. Finally, a series of even - and odd-numbered alkane homologs was identified in both leaf and peduncle waxes, with an internal methyl branch preferentially on C-11 and C-13 of homologs with even total carbon number and on C-12 of odd-numbered homologs.

We prospectively studied changes in melanopsin - mediated pupillary constriction in 19 participants with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 10 control across the summer and winter solstices. The melanopsin - mediated response, as measured by the pupil's sustained constriction six s after a high intensity blue light stimulus, was marginally attenuated in those with MDD relative to controls (p =0.071). The participants with MDD unexpectedly showed a significantly reduced transient pupillary response to low intensity red (p =0.011) and blue light (p =0.013), but not high intensity red and blue light. Sustained pupillary constriction in response to high intensity blue light was more pronounced with increasing daylight hours (p =0.037) and was more strongly related to objectively measured versus estimated light exposure. Melanopsin - mediated impairments in pupil response may serve as a biological marker for vulnerability to depression in low light conditions. Assessment of these and other responses to light stimuli, such as response to low intensity light, may be useful for the study of the neurobiology of MDD and related mood disorders."}

Indeed, long noncoding RNAs influence gene expression via epigenetic modulations, through regulating alternative splicing, or by acting as molecular sponges.

The ADAS - cog, MMSE and WHO-UCLA AVLT score in the rTMS group was significantly improved compared with baselines at 6 weeks after treatment (all p<0.05). Meanwhile, MoCA scores were also obviously ameliorated in the mild AD patients with rTMS. Besides, subgroup analysis showed that the effect of rTMS on the memory and language of mild AD patients was superior to those of moderate AD patients. In conclusion, our findings suggested that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation improves cognitive function, memory and language level of AD patients, especially in the mild stage of AD.

The extent to which WMH location relates to cognitive performance has received less attention, but is likely to be functionally important. We examined the relation between WMH location and cognition in a memory clinic cohort of patients with sporadic SVD. A total of 167 patients with SVD were recruited from memory clinics. Assumption-free region of interest-based analyses based on major white matter tracts and voxel - wise analyses were used to determine the association between WMH location and executive functioning, visuomotor speed and memory. Region of interest-based analyses showed that WMHs located particularly within the anterior thalamic radiation and forceps minor were inversely associated with both executive functioning and visuomotor speed, independent of total WMH volume. Memory was significantly associated with WMH volume in the forceps minor, independent of total WMH volume. An independent assumption-free voxel-wise analysis identified strategic voxels in these same tracts. Region of interest-based analyses showed that WMH volume within the anterior thalamic radiation explained 6.8% of variance in executive functioning, compared to 3.9% for total WMH volume; WMH volume within the forceps minor explained 4.6% of variance in visuomotor speed and 4.2% of variance in memory, compared to 1.8% and 1.3% respectively for total WMH volume. Our findings identify the anterior thalamic radiation and forceps minor as strategic white matter tracts in which WMHs are most strongly associated with cognitive impairment in memory clinic patients with SVD. WMH volumes in individual tracts explained more variance in cognition than total WMH burden, emphasizing the importance of lesion location when addressing the functional consequences of WMHs."}

Occasionally, such absorbed DNA is recombined into the organism's own genome, resulting in natural transformation (Figure 1). As a consequence, natural competence for transformation is considered a primary mode of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in prokaryotes, together with conjugation (direct cell to cell transfer of DNA via a specialized conjugal pilus) and phage transduction (DNA transfer mediated by viruses). HGT plays a major role in bacterial evolution, and past research has demonstrated that HGT, including natural competence for transformation, contributes to the emergence of pathogens and the spread of virulence factors. Indeed, Frederick Griffith discovered natural competence for transformation in 1928 while he was investigating the exchange of pathogenic traits in pneumococci. Due to the increase in the abundance and spread of multidrug-resistant microbes, research on HGT is even more important today than ever before."}

The causes of obstruction were aqueductal obstruction in 75% (n=15), 3rd ventricular obstruction in 5% (n=1) and 4th ventricular obstruction in 20 % (n=4). The cause of arrest of hydrocephalus was spontaneous third ventriculostomy in 65% (n=13), endoscopic third ventriculostomy in 10% (n=2), ventriculo-peritoneal shunt in 5% (n=1) and no cause could be detected in 20% of patients (n=4).

However, these isolated species, especially those with sensitive life history traits, are at high risk for the adverse effects of genetic drift and habitat degradation by non-native wildlife. Here, we study the population genetic diversity, structure, and stability of a classic \" island giant \" (Xantusia riversiana, the Island Night Lizard) on San Clemente Island, California following the removal of feral goats. Using DNA microsatellites, we found that this population is reasonably genetically robust despite historical grazing, with similar effective population sizes and genetic diversity metrics across all sampling locations irrespective of habitat type and degree of degradation. However, we also found strong site-specific patterns of genetic variation and low genetic diversity compared to mainland congeners, warranting continued special management as an island endemic. We identify both high and low elevation areas that remain valuable repositories of genetic diversity and provide a case study for other low-dispersal coastal organisms in the face of future climate change."}

Accordingly, full genome phylogenetic analysis of multiple new CMV field isolates derived from two closely related nonhuman primate species, Indian-origin rhesus macaques (RM) and Mauritian -origin cynomolgus macaques (MCM), revealed distinct and tight lineage clustering according to the species of origin, with MCM CMV isolates mirroring the limited genetic diversity of their primate host that underwent a population bottleneck 400 years ago. Despite the ability of Rhesus CMV (RhCMV) laboratory strain 68-1 to replicate efficiently in MCM fibroblasts and potently inhibit antigen presentation to MCM T cells in vitro, RhCMV 68-1 failed to productively infect MCM in vivo, even in the absence of host CD8+ T and NK cells. In contrast, RhCMV clone 68-1.2, genetically repaired to express the homologues of the HCMV anti-apoptosis gene UL36 and epithelial cell tropism genes UL128 and UL130 absent in 68-1, efficiently infected MCM as evidenced by the induction of transgene -specific T cells and virus shedding. Recombinant variants of RhCMV 68-1 and 68-1.2 revealed that expression of either UL36 or UL128 together with UL130 enabled productive MCM infection, indicating that multiple layers of cross- species restriction operate even between closely related hosts. Cumulatively, these results implicate cell tropism and evasion of apoptosis as critical determinants of CMV transmission across primate species barriers, and extend the macaque model of human CMV infection and immunology to MCM, a nonhuman primate species with uniquely simplified host immunogenetics."}

The benefits of nonoperative versus operative treatment for patients with SPS and DS with regards to sexual function are unknown. Demographic, treatment, and follow-up data, including the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), were obtained on patients enrolled in the SPORT study. Based on the response to question #9 in the ODI, patients were classified into a sexual life relevant (SLR) or sexual life not relevant (NR) group. Univariate and multivariate analysis of patient characteristics comparing the NR and SLR group were performed. Operative treatment groups were compared to the nonoperative group with regards to response to ODI question #9 to determine the impact of surgery on sexual function. A total of 1235 patients were included to determine relevance of sex life. Three hundred sixty-six patients (29%) were included in the NR group.

However, only a few enzymes and their encoding genes involved in UDP-Rha biosynthesis are available in plants. Here, two genes encoding rhamnose synthase (RhS) and bi-functional UDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-glucose (UDP-4K6DG) 3, 5-epimerase/UDP-4-keto-L-rhamnose (UDP-4KR) 4-keto-reductase (UER) were isolated from Ornithogalum caudatum based on the RNA - Seq data. The OcRhS1 gene has an ORF (open reading frame) of 2019 bp encoding a tri-functional RhS enzyme. In vitro enzymatic assays revealed OcRhS1 can really convert UDP-D-glucose (UDP-Glc) into UDP-Rha via three consecutive reactions. Biochemical evidences indicated that the recombinant OcRhS1 was active in the pH range of 5-11 and over the temperature range of 0-60 \u00b0C. The Km value of OcRhS1 for UDP-Glc was determined to be 1.52 \u00d7 10(-4) M. OcRhS1 is a multi-domain protein with two sets of cofactor-binding motifs. The cofactors dependent properties of OcRhS1 were thus characterized in this research. Moreover, the N-terminal portion of OcRhS1 (OcRhS1-N) was observed to metabolize UDP-Glc to form intermediate UDP-4K6DG. OcUER1 contains an ORF of 906 bp encoding a polypeptide of 301 aa. OcUER1 shared high similarity with the carboxy-terminal domain of OcRhS1 (OcRhS1-C), suggesting its intrinsic ability of converting UDP-4K6DG into UDP-Rha. It was thus reasonably inferred that UDP-Glc could be bio-transformed into UDP-Rha under the collaborating action of OcRhS1-N and OcUER1. The subsequently biochemical assay verified this notion. Importantly, expression profiles of OcRhS1 and OcUER1 revealed their possible involvement in the biosynthesis of rhamnose -containing polysaccharides in O. caudatum."}

Merozoites present a complex array of antigens to the immune system, and currently, there is only a partial understanding of the targets of protective antibodies and how responses to different antigens are acquired and boosted. We hypothesized that there would be differences in the rate of acquisition of antibodies to different antigens and how well they are boosted by infection, which impacts the acquisition of immunity. We examined responses to a range of merozoite antigens in 2 different cohorts of children and adults with different age structures and levels of malaria exposure. Overall, antibodies were associated with age, exposure, and active infection, and the repertoire of responses increased with age and active infection. However, rates of antibody acquisition varied between antigens and different regions within an antigen following exposure to malaria, supporting our hypothesis. Antigen -specific responses could be broadly classified into early response types in which antibodies were acquired early in childhood exposure and late response types that appear to require substantially more exposure for the development of substantial levels. We identified antigen -specific responses that were effectively boosted after recent infection, whereas other responses were not. These findings advance our understanding of the acquisition of human immunity to malaria and are relevant to the development of malaria vaccines targeting merozoite antigens and the selection of antigens for use in malaria surveillance."}

In Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, one of the model cyanobacteria, DNA replication depends on photosynthetic electron transport. However, the critical signal for the regulatory mechanism of DNA replication has not been identified. In addition, conservation of this regulatory mechanism has not been investigated among cyanobacteria. To understand this regulatory signal and its dependence on light, we examined the regulation of DNA replication under both light and dark conditions among three model cyanobacteria, S. elongatus PCC 7942, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and Anabaena sp. PCC 7120. Interestingly, DNA replication activity in Synechocystis and Anabaena was retained when cells were transferred to the dark, although it was drastically decreased in S. elongatus. Glycogen metabolism and respiration were higher in Synechocystis and Anabaena than in S. elongatus in the dark. Moreover, DNA replication activity in Synechocystis and Anabaena was reduced to the same level as that in S. elongatus by inhibition of respiratory electron transport after transfer to the dark. These results demonstrate that there is disparity in DNA replication occurring in the dark among cyanobacteria, which is caused by the difference in activity of respiratory electron transport."}

However, while necessary, massed practice may not be sufficient for ensuring progress in speech-language therapy. Motivated by recent advances in neuroscience, it has been claimed that using language as a tool for communication and social interaction leads to synergistic effects in left perisylvian eloquent areas. Here, we conducted a crossover randomized controlled trial to determine the influence of communicative language function on the outcome of intensive aphasia therapy. Eighteen individuals with left-hemisphere lesions and chronic non-fluent aphasia each received two types of training in counterbalanced order: (i) Intensive Language-Action Therapy (ILAT, an extended form of Constraint-Induced Aphasia Therapy) embedding verbal utterances in the context of communication and social interaction, and (ii) Naming Therapy focusing on speech production per se. Both types of training were delivered with the same high intensity (3.5 h per session) and duration (six consecutive working days), with therapy materials and number of utterances matched between treatment groups. A standardized aphasia test battery revealed significantly improved language performance with ILAT, independent of when this method was administered. In contrast, Naming Therapy tended to benefit language performance only when given at the onset of the treatment, but not when applied after previous intensive training. The current results challenge the notion that massed practice alone promotes recovery from chronic post-stroke aphasia. Instead, our results demonstrate that using language for communication and social interaction increases the efficacy of intensive aphasia therapy."}

Evidence of long-term health risks among small neonates who subsequently grow rapidly poses a challenge for interventions aiming to support healthy growth, not merely drive weight gain. Defining healthy growth beyond \"getting bigger\" is essential as infant and young child feeding industries expand. Liquid -based nutritional supplements, originally formulated for undernourished children, are increasingly marketed for and consumed by children generally.

Evidence points to changing social beliefs and cultural practices surrounding supplementary feeding, raising specific concerns about the long-term health consequences of an associated altered feeding culture, including reduced dietary variety and weight gain. Reassessing the evidence for and relevance of dietary supplements' \" promoting healthy growth \" claims for otherwise healthy children is both needed in a time of global obesity and an opportunity to refine intervention approaches among small children for whom rapid subsequent growth in early life augments risk for chronic disease.

We utilized data from a large longitudinal study of college students from the United States (N = 2607). Three waves of questionnaire-based data were collected over the first two years of college (in 2011-2013).

There were significant correlations between alcohol problems and internalizing symptoms. A direction of effect was found between alcohol problems and internalizing symptoms but differed between genders. A unidirectional relationship varying with age was identified for males where alcohol problems initially predicted internalizing symptoms followed by internalizing symptoms predicting alcohol problems. For females, a unidirectional relationship existed wherein alcohol problems predicted internalizing symptoms. Conclusions/Importance: We conclude that the relationship between alcohol problems and internalizing symptoms is complex and differ between genders. In males, both phenotypes are predictive of each other, while in females the relationship is driven by alcohol problems.

Attempts to date contusions, however, have generally been unsuccessful by macroscopic observation, whereas the microscopic observations provide broad data but are also anatomically imprecise as a function of time. Intracranial lesions are of particular significance with respect to the timing of organizing hemorrhage given the acute, and often life-threatening nature of the hemorrhages, and the medicolegal investigation into potential crimes. Of concern is that the Prussian Blue reaction for iron, a relatively straightforward histochemical reaction that has been in use for over 150 years, is sometimes suggested as a diagnostic test for chronicity. Therefore, this study examined the utility of the Prussian Blue iron stain in living patients with intracranial hemorrhages and well-defined symptom onset, to test whether the presence of Prussian Blue reactivity could be correlated with chronicity. It was found that out of 12 cases with intracranial hemorrhage, eight cases showed at least focal iron reactivity. The duration from symptom onset to surgery in those eight cases ranged from < 24 hours to more than 3 days. Of those cases with no iron reactivity, the duration from symptom onset to surgery ranged from < 24 hours to six days. In conclusion, the Prussian Blue reaction was unreliable as an indicator of timing in intracranial hemorrhage. The use of the Prussian blue reaction as an independent indicator of chronicity is therefore not valid and can be misleading. Caution is indicated when employing iron staining for timing purposes, as its only use is to highlight, as opposed to identify, pre-existing lesions. With respect to brain lesions, the Prussian blue reaction should not be used in place of the clinical timing of the neurologic decline, or clinical data that is otherwise more accurate and less susceptible to false positive results."}

{"document_id": "27861731", "text": "Identification of mineral - binding peptides that discriminate between chalcopyrite and enargite Innovative approaches to the separation of minerals and subsequent extraction of metals are imperative owing to the increasing mineralogical complexity of ore deposits that are difficult or even impossible to separate into slurries or solutions containing only the minerals or metals of interest. Low recovery of metal is typical for these complex deposits leading to significant losses to tailings. In addition, the minerals often contain impurities, some toxic, which are difficult and costly to control or manage during the processing of a concentrate or other mineral product. One example of this complex situation is the significant economic and environmental costs associated with diluting and processing copper concentrates containing arsenic (in the form of the mineral enargite, Cu3 AsS4) in the production of pure copper. To overcome these separation problems, we have utilized phage display to identify peptides that demonstrate selective recognition of enargite and the arsenic - free copper sulfide, chalcopyrite. Screening of two random peptide phage display libraries resulted in the identification of an enargite - selective peptide with the sequence MHKPTVHIKGPT and a chalcopyrite - selective peptide with the sequence RKKKCKGNCCYTPQ. Mineral - binding selectivity was demonstrated by binding studies, zeta potential determination and immunochemistry. Peptides that have the ability to discriminate between enargite and chalcopyrite provide a greener option for the separation of arsenic containing contaminants from copper concentrates. This represents the first step towards a major advance in the replacement or reduction of toxic collectors as well as reducing the level of arsenic - bearing minerals in the early stages of mineral processing.

We examined its potential effects on high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-associated sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) content (HDL - S1P) and HDL -mediated protection against oxidative stress, both with and without statin treatment. In a case-control study, HDL was isolated from 12 FH patients with and without statin treatment and from 12 healthy controls. The HDL - S1P content and the capacity of HDL to protect cardiomyocytes against oxidative stress in vitro were measured. HDL -associated S1P was significantly correlated with cell protection, but not with HDL-cholesterol or apolipoprotein AI. The latter did not correlate with HDL -mediated cell protection. Neither the HDL - S1P content nor HDL protective capacity differed between nontreated FH patients and controls. The relative amounts of apolipoprotein AI and apolipoprotein M were similar between controls and FH patients. Statin treatment had no effect on any of these measures. The FH environment is not detrimental to HDL - S1P content or HDL - S1P -mediated cell protection. Statin treatment does not modulate HDL function in this regard."}

However, artificial immobilization carriers are expensive and pose a high safety risk. Okara, a food-grade byproduct from soymilk production, is rich in prebiotics. Lactobacilli could provide health enhancing effects to the host. This study aimed to evaluate the potential of okara as a natural immobilizer for L. plantarum 70810 cells. The study also aimed to evaluate the effects of okara-immobilized L. plantarum 70810 cells (IL) on soymilk fermentation, glucosidic isoflavone bioconversion, and cell resistance to simulated gastric and intestinal stresses. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to show cells adherence to the surface of okara. Lactic acid, acetic acid and isoflavone analyses in unfermented and fermented soymilk were performed by HPLC with UV detection. Viability and growth kinetics of immobilized and free L. plantarum 70810 cells (FL) were followed during soymilk fermentation. Moreover, changes in pH, titrable acidity and viscosity were measured by conventional methods. For in vitro testing of simulated gastrointestinal resistance, fermented soymilk was inoculated with FL or IL and an aliquot incubated into acidic MRS broth which was conveniently prepared to simulate gastric, pancreatic juices and bile salts. Survival to simulated gastric and intestinal stresses was evaluated by plate count of colony forming units on MRS agar. SEM revealed that the lactobacilli cells attached and bound to the surface of okara. Compared with FL, IL exhibited a significantly higher specific growth rate, shorter lag phase of growth, higher productions of lactic and acetic acids, a faster decrease in pH and increase in titrable acidity, and a higher soymilk viscosity. Similarly, IL in soymilk showed higher productions of daizein and genistein compared with the control. Compared with FL, IL showed reinforced resistance to simulatedgastric and intestinal stresses in vitro that included low pH, low pH plus pepsin, pancreatin, and bile salt. Our results indicate that okara is a new potential immobilization carrier to enhance the growth and glucosidic isoflavone bioconversion activities of L. plantarum in soymilk and improve cell survivability following simulated gastric and intestinal conditions."}

Prospective, randomized controlled study. Operating room in a university hospital. One hundred adult patients scheduled for elective surgery under LMA general anesthesia were enrolled. Patients were randomly allocated to 2 groups: GLMA group using a visual stylet-guided technique (n=50) and BLMA group using standard blind technique (n=50). Correct placement of the LMA was confirmed using clinical test along with fiberoptic assessment. Unblinded data were collected about the insertion time, the first attempt success rate, the LMA position adjustment rate, fiberoptic view of LMA anatomical position, hemodynamic responses, and the adverse insertion responses (bucking, breathholding, and laryngospasm). Blinded data were recorded about postoperative airway morbidity (visible blood staining on LMA at removal, sore throat, and hoarseness). Insertion was more frequently successful at the first attempt in GLMA than that in BLMA group (100% vs 92%; P=.041). The time taken for establishing effective airway was shorter in GLMA than that in BLMA (54.8 vs 62.9 seconds; P=.001). The patients in BLMA group required more readjustment and reinsertion than those in GLMA group (38% vs 0%; P=.000). The fiberoptic view was significantly better in GLMA group (P<.001). No difference between the 2 groups existed regarding hemodynamic stress responses, incidences of adverse insertion responses, and postoperative airway morbidity. By direct visualizing the whole process of LMA insertion, the Discopo visual stylet increases the success rate and accuracy rate of LMA placement without increasing hemodynamic stress response or incidences of adverse events."}

The molecular mechanisms of epileptogenesis have not yet been clarified, and pharmacoresistance exhibited by 30-40% of epilepsy patients remains a major obstacle in medical care. Growing evidence indicates a role of lipid signalling pathways in epileptogenesis, thus lipid signals emerge as potential biomarkers for the onset and evolving course of the epileptic disorder, as well as potential therapeutic agents and targets. For this purpose, we applied a lipidomic strategy to unravel lipid alterations in brain regions, periphery tissues and plasma that are specific for acute epileptic seizures in mice at 1h after seizure induction by systemic kainic acid injection as compared to vehicle controls. Specifically, levels of (i) selected phospholipids and sphingomyelins, (ii) the endocannabinoids anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG), and the endocannabinoid -related compounds oleoylethanolamide (OEA) and palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), (iii) arachidonic acid (AA), (iv) selected eicosanoids, and (v) fatty acyl content of lipidome were determined in pulverized tissues from six brain regions of kainic acid induced epileptic seizure models and vehicle controls: hypothalamus, hippocampus, thalamus, striatum, cerebellum and cerebral cortex, and from peripheral organs, such as heart and lungs, and in plasma. Alterations in lipid levels after acute epileptic seizures as compared to non-seizure controls were found to be brain region - and periphery tissue - specific, including specific plasma lipid correlates, highlighting their value as marker candidates in translational research studies, and/or drug discovery and response monitoring."}

Here, we report a patient who developed of acute-onset encephalopathy and coma, which began shortly after administration of panitumumab for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. Echocardiography revealed that the drug had been infused into the left cardiac ventricle via a dislocated central venous line. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging disclosed multiple cortical hyperintensities, which were preferentially located in the frontal lobes. While the neurological condition improved within a few days, the patient died 4 weeks later. It seems likely that the administration of the antibody via the intra-arterial route contributed to the development of this condition. Toxic encephalopathy may be a hitherto unrecognized complication of panitumumab treatment and should be taken into consideration in patients developing CNS symptoms undergoing this therapy."}

To characterize the abundance of SSRs (1-6 base-pairs [bp]) on the cattle Y chromsome, the relative frequency and density of perfect or uninterrupted SSRs based on the published Y chromosome sequence were examined. A total of 17,273 perfect SSRs were found, with total length of 324.78 kb, indicating that approximately 0.75% of the cattle Y chromosome sequence (43.30 Mb) comprises perfect SSRs, with an average length of 18.80 bp. The relative frequency and density were 398.92 loci/Mb and 7500.62 bp /Mb, respectively. The proportions of the six classes of perfect SSRs were highly variable on the cattle Y chromosome. Mononucleotide repeats had a total number of 8073 (46.74%) and an average length of 15.45 bp, and were the most abundant SSRs class, while the percentages of di-, tetra-, tri-, penta-, and hexa-nucleotide repeats were 22.86%, 11.98%, 11.58%, 6.65%, and 0.19%, respectively. Different classes of SSRs varied in their repeat number, with the highest being 42 for dinucleotides. Results reveal that repeat categories A, AC, AT, AAC, AGC, GTTT, CTTT, ATTT, and AACTG predominate on the Y chromosome.

The association between women's state-level socioeconomic status (SES) and PPD has not been explored. This study aimed to examine whether the association between antenatal SLE and PPD symptoms was moderated by women's state-level SES. Data from the 2009-2011 Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) were used. State-level women's employment / earnings and social / economic autonomy indices were computed from indicators published by the Institute of Women's Policy Research (IWPR). Multilevel multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed. Among 91,253 women with valid responses, 11.3% had PPD symptoms, prevalence ranging from 7.1% in Illinois to 17.1% in Arkansas. Women who experienced all four stressor categories, including partner related, traumatic, emotional, and financial, had the highest odds (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 5.43; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.36-5.51) of PPD symptoms. The odds of experiencing PPD symptoms decreased with an increase in the state-level social / economic autonomy index (aOR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.64-0.88). There was significant cross-level interaction between number of stressor categories experienced and state-level index. Screening for antenatal SLEs can help identify women at risk for PPD symptoms. That the odds of having PPD symptoms decreased with increasing state-level social / economic autonomy and women residing in states with lower indices were more vulnerable to the impacts of antenatal stressors, could have policy implications related to improving the SES of women in these states."}

The aortic wall is simulated by a composite structure submodel representing material properties of the three main wall layers. The IMH is described by a poroelasticity submodel which takes into account both the pressure inside hematoma and its deformation. The submodel of the hematoma is fully coupled with the aortic submodel as well as with the submodel of the pulsatile blood flow. Model simulations are used to investigate the relation between the peak wall stress, hematoma thickness and permeability in patients of different age. The results indicate that an increase in hematoma thickness leads to larger wall stress, which is in agreement with clinical data. Further simulations demonstrate that a hematoma with smaller permeability results in larger wall stress, suggesting that blood coagulation in hematoma might increase its mechanical stability. This is in agreement with previous experimental observations of coagulation having a beneficial effect on the condition of a patient with the IMH."}

Materials and Methods: Of the 424,712 participants who underwent health examinations in 2002-2008, 139,519 men \u226540 years old and without prostate cancer were followed from the beginning of 2002 to the end of 2012. Multivariate adjusted Cox regression analysis was conducted to examine the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the association between prostate cancer and body mass index (BMI) both with and without diabetes. Results: The HR for prostate cancer according to the existence of diabetes was stratified by BMI in both age - and multivariable-adjusted models. In the population without diabetes, the HR for prostate cancer significantly increased as BMI increased beyond the reference range in a model adjusted for age and multiple variables; however, the increase in the HR was small. In the population with diabetes, the HR for prostate cancer significantly increased as BMI increased from < 18.5 kg/m(2) to within the reference range (18.5 to 22.9) in the multivariable-adjusted model. In addition, a marked decrease in HR in the population with BMI of < 18.5 kg/m(2) was seen compared to the reference or higher BMI population. Conclusion: This population -based study shows the evidence of association between obesity and development of prostate cancer, and the risk increases vary according to the change of BMI category and the existence of diabetes."}

The purpose of this study was to phylogenetically investigate the differences between the genotypes of HCV, and to determine the types of amino acid codon usage in the structure of the virus in order to discover new methods for treatment regimes. The codon usage of the six genotypes of the HCV nucleotide sequence was investigated through the online application available on the website Gene Infinity. Also, phylogenetic analysis and the evolutionary relationship of HCV genotypes were analyzed with MEGA 7 software. The six genotypes of HCV were divided into two groups based on their codon usage properties. In the first group, genotypes 1 and 5 (74.02%), and in the second group, genotypes 2 and 6 (72.43%) were shown to have the most similarity in terms of codon usage. Unlike the results with respect to determining the similarity of codon usage, the phylogenetic analysis showed the closest resemblance and correlation between genotypes 1 and 4. The results also showed that HCV has a GC (guanine - cytosine) abundant genome structure and prefers codons with GC for translation. Genotypes 1 and 4 demonstrated remarkable similarity in terms of genome sequences and proteins, but surprisingly, in terms of the preferred codons for gene expression, they showed the greatest difference. More studies are therefore needed to confirm the results and select the best approach for treatment of these genotypes based on their codon usage properties."}

Increasing evidence suggests that insulin resistance plays an important role in AD pathogenesis, possibly due to abnormal GSK3\u03b2 activation, causing intra- and extracellular amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) accumulation. Adiponectin (APN) is an adipokine with insulin-sensitizing and anti-inflammatory effects. Reduced circulatory APN level is associated with insulin resistance and T2DM. The role of APN in AD has not been elucidated. In this study, we aim to examine if adiponectin deficiency would lead to cerebral insulin resistance, cognitive decline and Alzheimer's-like pathology in mice. To study the role of adiponectin in cognitive functions, we employed adiponectin-knockout (APN-KO) mice and demonstrated chronic APN deficiency in their CNS. Behavioral tests were performed to study the cognitions of male APN-KO mice. Brains and tissue lysates were collected to study the pathophysiological and molecular changes in the brain of APN-KO mice. SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line was used to study the molecular mechanism upon APN and insulin treatment. Aged APN -deficient mice displayed spatial memory and learning impairments, fear-conditioned memory deficit as well as anxiety. These mice also developed AD pathologies including increased cerebral A\u03b242 level, A\u03b2 deposition, hyperphosphorylated Tau proteins, microgliosis and astrogliosis with increased cerebral IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1 levels that associated with increased neuronal apoptosis and reduced synaptic proteins levels, suggesting APN deficiency may lead to neuronal and synaptic loss in the brain. AD pathologies -associated APN - KO mice displayed attenuated AMPK phosphorylation and impaired insulin signaling including decreased Akt induction and increased GSK3\u03b2 activation in the hippocampus and frontal cortex. Aged APN -KO mice developed hippocampal insulin resistance with reduced pAkt induction upon intracerebral insulin injection. Consistently, APN treatment in SH-SY5Y cells with insulin resistance and overexpressing A\u03b2 induce higher pAkt levels through AdipoR1 upon insulin treatment whereas the induction was blocked by compound C, indicating APN can enhance neuronal insulin sensitivity through AMPK activation. Our results indicated that chronic APN deficiency inactivated AMPK causing insulin desensitization and elicited AD-like pathogenesis in aged mice which also developed significant cognitive impairments and psychiatric symptoms."}

We test the hypothesis that cytosolic inorganic phosphate (Pi) can account for the contraction - induced reductions in twitch duration which impair summation and cause force to decline (sag) during unfused tetanic contractions of fast-twitch muscle. A five-state model of crossbridge cycling was used to simulate twitch and unfused tetanic contractions. As Pi concentration ([Pi]) was increased from 0 to 30 mmol\u00b7L(-1), twitch duration decreased, with progressive reductions in sensitivity to Pi as [Pi] was increased. When unfused tetani were simulated with rising [Pi], sag was most pronounced when initial [Pi] was low, and when the magnitude of [Pi] increase was large. Fast-twitch extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles (sag-prone, typically low basal [Pi]) and slow-twitch soleus muscles (sag - resistant, typically high basal [Pi]) were isolated from 14 female C57BL/6 mice. Muscles were sequentially incubated in solutions containing either glucose or pyruvate to create typical and low Pi environments, respectively. Twitch duration was greater (P < 0.05) in pyruvate than glucose in both muscles. Stimuli applied at intervals approximately three times the time to peak twitch tension resulted in sag of 35.0 \u00b1 3.7% in glucose and 50.5 \u00b1 1.4% in pyruvate in the EDL (pyruvate > glucose; P < 0.05), and 3.9 \u00b1 0.3% in glucose and 37.8 \u00b1 2.7% in pyruvate in the soleus (pyruvate > glucose; P < 0.05).

In this work, we have analyzed the changes in serum composition in gilts after switching their housing, from pen to individual stalls, which is generally accepted to cause animal discomfort. Blood and saliva samples were collected a day before and up to four days after changing the housing system. Biochemical analyses showed adaptive changes in lipid and protein metabolism after the housing switch, whereas cortisol and muscular markers showed a large variability between animals. 2D-DIGE and iTRAQ proteomic approaches revealed variations in serum protein composition after changing housing and diet of gilts. Both techniques showed alterations in two main homeostatic mechanisms: the innate immune and redox systems. The acute phase proteins haptoglobin, apolipoprotein A-I and \u03b11-antichymotrypsin 3, and the antioxidant enzyme peroxiredoxin 2 were found differentially expressed by 2D-DIGE. Other proteins related to the innate immune system, including lactotransferrin, protegrin 3 and galectin 1 were also identified by iTRAQ, as well as oxidative stress enzymes such as peroxiredoxin 2 and glutathione peroxidase 3. Proteomics also revealed the decrease of apolipoproteins, and the presence of intracellular proteins in serum, which may indicate physical injury to tissues. Housing of gilts in individual stalls and diet change increase lipid and protein catabolism, oxidative stress, activate the innate immune system and cause a certain degree of tissue damage. We propose that valuable assays for stress assessment in gilts may be based on a score composed by a combination of salivary cortisol, lipid metabolites, innate immunity and oxidative stress markers and intracellular proteins."}

The urokinase (uPA)-mediated plasminogen activation system is involved in physiological and pathological events based on cell migration and tissue remodelling, such as inflammation, wound healing, angiogenesis and metastasis. uPA is a serine protease that binds uPAR, a high affinity glycosyl-phosphatidyl-inositol (GPI)-anchored receptor. uPAR focuses uPA activity at the cell surface and activates intracellular signaling through lateral interactions with integrins, receptor tyrosine kinases and the G-protein-coupled family of fMLF chemotaxis receptors (FPRs). We investigated the expression of the uPA - uPAR system and its functional interaction with FPRs in human mast cells (MCs). Differently from basophils, MCs produced uPA that was able to induce their chemotaxis. Indeed, MCs also expressed uPAR, both in the intact and in a cleaved form (DII-DIII-uPAR) that can expose, at the N-terminus, the SRSRY sequence, able to interact with FPRs and to mediate cell chemotaxis. MCs also expressed mRNAs for FPRs that were functionally active; indeed, uPA and a soluble peptide (uPAR84-95), containing the SRSRY chemotactic sequence of uPAR and able to interact with FPRs, were able to induce MCs chemotaxis. Thus, uPA is a potent chemoattractant for MCs acting through the exposure of the chemotactic epitope of uPAR, that is an endogenous ligand for FPRs. The same mechanism could be involved in VEGF-A secretion by human MCs, also induced by uPA and uPAR84-95 stimulation."}

In the present study, we attempted to demonstrate effects and preferred modes of therapeutic intervention in PNES patients with ID being treated at a Japanese municipal center with a short referral chain. We examined 46 PNES patients with ID (ID group) and 106 PNES patients without ID (non-ID group) retrospectively in case charts. In addition to examining basic demographic and clinical data, effects of different therapeutic intervention were examined as a function of decrease or disappearance of PNES attacks in the ID group. Age at the first visit as well as PNES onset was younger in the ID than in the non-ID group (t=2.651, p=0.009; t=3.528, p=0.001, respectively). PNES -free ratio at the last visit tended to be higher in the non-ID group (chi square =3.455; p=0.063). Psychosis was more often encountered in the ID group (chi square =13.443; p=0.001). Although cognitive therapy and pharmaco-therapeutic approaches were quite similarly distributed in both groups, environmental adjustment was often introduced in the ID group (44%) as compared to the non-ID group (15%) (chi square =14.299; p=0.001). Brief weekly visit service is also more often utilized by the patients with ID (54%) than by those without ID (35%) (chi square =5.021, p=0.025). Optimal treatment approaches in this sizable patient subgroup should be the subject of future prospective studies."}

A patient with an abnormally high level of the tumor markers, carbohydrate antigen-724 (CA724), CA19-9 and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), although without any detectable tumor, was treated with an immunomodulatory therapy featuring an infusion of cytokine-induced autologous killer cells (CIKs) at the request of the patient. Following the therapy, the three tumor markers rapidly decreased to below the normal reference level, although there still were slight fluctuations within a narrow range frequently. The patient was monitored for 21 months to the present day and no abnormality was observed. The results indicated that this therapy may be applied as a novel strategy that is effective and reliable for cancer prevention. As there is no promising regimen for the prevention of malignancies to date, such a treatment may become a major cancer prophylactic regimen, particularly for patients who are at a high risk of cancer."}

A player's ability to tolerate and contest during a tackle is a prerequisite for safe participation and success in rugby. Little is known about the relationship between tackle training and tackling in matches in rugby union. Therefore, we investigated the relationships between players' training attitudes and behaviour and their match attitudes and behaviour for tackling in rugby union. A questionnaire was designed to assess attitude (importance) and behaviours (frequency and quantity) among junior (under 19) players on a 5-point Likert Scale. Questionnaires were handed out to 220 players (10 schools) at a tournament and 75% (9 schools, n=164) were returned for analysis. Associations between training attitudes and behaviours were tested using the \u03c7(2) test, Cramer's V and \u03c4-b. The more time spent on emphasising proper technique to prevent injuries in training, the more important players rated 'own safety' (\u03c4-b=0.21, moderate, z=3.1, p<0.01), 'going for the ball only' (\u03c4-b=0.27, moderate, z=4.6, p<0.001) and 'staying on feet' (\u03c4-b=0.23, moderate, z=3.6, p<0.001) in match play. The more time spent on emphasising proper technique to improve performance in training, the more important players rated actions 'going for ball only' (\u03c4-b=0.23, moderate, z=3.7, p<0.001) and ' preventing the ball carrier from retaining position ' (\u03c4-b=0.20, moderate, z=3.1, p<0.01) in match play. This is the first study to report on the relationships between players ' training attitudes and behaviour and their match attitudes and behaviour s for tackling in rugby union. The importance of tackle training to prevent injury, and the amount of time spent on technique to prevent injuries, was associated with behaviours that reduce the risk of injury in matches."}

Diabetic nephropathy has become the most common single cause of end-stage renal disease worldwide. Oxidative stress and inflammation factors are hypothesized to play a role in the development of late diabetes complications. Chronic hyperglycemia increases oxidative stress, significantly modifies the structure and function of proteins and lipids, and induces glycoxidation and peroxidation. Therefore, hyperglycemia causes auto-oxidation of glucose, glycation of proteins, and activation of polyol mechanism. Overproduction of intracellular reactive oxygen species contributes to several microvascular and macrovascular complications of DN. On the other hand, reactive oxygen species modulates signaling cascade of immune factors. An increase in reactive oxygen species can increase the production of inflammatory cytokines, and likewise, an increase in inflammatory cytokines can stimulate the production of free radicals. Some studies have shown that kidney inflammation is serious in promoting the development and progression of DN. Inflammatory factors which are activated by the metabolic, biochemical, and hemodynamic derangements are known to exist in the diabetic kidney. This review discusses facts for oxidative stress and inflammatory factors in DN and encompasses the role of immune and inflammatory cells, inflammatory cytokines, and stress oxidative factors."}

A comparison is made between these two technologies in terms of infrastructure and maintenance, dosimetry, shielding requirements, staffing, costs, security, patient throughput and clinical use. Infrastructure and maintenance are more demanding for linacs due to the complex electric componentry. In dosimetry, a higher beam energy, modulated dose rate and smaller focal spot size mean that it is easier to create an optimised treatment with a linac for conformal dose coverage of the tumour while sparing healthy organs at risk. In shielding, the requirements for a concrete bunker are similar for cobalt-60 machines and linacs but extra shielding and protection from neutrons are required for linacs. Staffing levels can be higher for linacs and more staff training is required for linacs. Life cycle costs are higher for linacs, especially multi-energy linacs. Security is more complex for cobalt-60 machines because of the high activity radioactive source. Patient throughput can be affected by source decay for cobalt-60 machines but poor maintenance and breakdowns can severely affect patient throughput for linacs. In clinical use, more complex treatment techniques are easier to achieve with linacs, and the availability of electron beams on high - energy linacs can be useful for certain treatments. In summary, there is no simple answer to the question of the choice of either cobalt-60 machines or linacs for radiotherapy in low- and middle-income countries. In fact a radiotherapy department with a combination of technologies, including orthovoltage X-ray units, may be an option. Local needs, conditions and resources will have to be factored into any decision on technology taking into account the characteristics of both forms of teletherapy, with the primary goal being the sustainability of the radiotherapy service over the useful lifetime of the equipment."}

The aim of this analysis was to determine interobserver and intraobserver reliability of commonly used clinical tests in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). We studied subjects with symptomatic knee OA who were participants in an open-label clinical trial of intraarticular steroid therapy. Following standardization of the clinical test procedures, 2 clinicians assessed 25 subjects independently at the same visit, and the same clinician assessed 88 subjects over an interval period of 2-10 weeks; in both cases prior to the steroid intervention. Clinical examination included assessment of bony enlargement, crepitus, quadriceps wasting, knee effusion, joint-line and anserine tenderness, and knee range of movement (ROM). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), estimated kappa (\u03ba), weighted kappa (\u03ba\u03c9), and Bland-Altman plots were used to determine interobserver and intraobserver levels of agreement. Using Landis and Koch criteria, interobserver \u03ba scores were moderate for patellofemoral joint (\u03ba = 0.53) and anserine tenderness (\u03ba = 0.48); good for bony enlargement (\u03ba = 0.66), quadriceps wasting (\u03ba = 0.78), crepitus (\u03ba = 0.78), medial tibiofemoral joint tenderness (\u03ba = 0.76), and effusion assessed by ballottement (\u03ba = 0.73) and bulge sign (\u03ba\u03c9 = 0.78); and excellent for lateral tibiofemoral joint tenderness (\u03ba = 1.00), flexion (ICC = 0.97), and extension (ICC = 0.87) ROM.

This framework recognizes three levels of kinetics. First is the particokinetics associated with deposition of nanocarriers into tissues associated with drug effect and toxicity, their residence inside those tissues, and elimination of the nanocarriers from the body. Second is the release pattern in time of free drug from the nanocarriers. Third is the pharmacokinetics of free drug, as it relates to deposition and elimination processes in the target and toxicity associated tissues, and total body clearance. A figure of merit, the drug targeting index (DTI), is used to quantitate the benefit of nanocarrier based drug delivery by considering the effects of preferential deposition of nanoparticles into target tissues and relative avoidance of tissues associated with drug toxicity, compared to drug that is administered in its free form. General methods are derived for calculating DTI when appropriate particokinetic, pharmacokinetic, and drug release rate information is available, and it is shown that relatively simple algebraic forms result when some common assumptions are made. This approach may find use in developing and selecting nanocarrier formulations, either for populations or for individuals."}

Transfusion of the virus-specific donor T-lymphocytes represents an alternative to a highly toxic and often ineffective antiviral therapy. Potentially promising cell therapy approach comprises transfusion of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, specific to the viral antigens, immediately after their isolation from the donor's blood circulation without any in vitro expansion. Specific T-cells could be separated from potentially alloreactive lymphocytes using recombinant major histocompatibility complex (MHC) multimers, carrying synthetic viral peptides. Rapid transfusion of virus - specific T-cells to patients has several crucial advantages in comparison with methods based on the in vitro expansion of the cells. About 30% of hematopoietic stem cell donors and 46% of transplant recipients at the National Research Center for Hematology were carriers of the HLA-A*02 allele. Moreover, 94% of Russian donors have an immune response against the cytomegalovirus (CMV). Using recombinant HLA-A*02 multimers carrying an immunodominant cytomegalovirus peptide (NLV), we have shown that the majority of healthy donors have pronounced T-cell immunity against this antigen, whereas shortly after the transplantation the patients do not have specific T-lymphocytes. The donor cells have the immune phenotype of memory cells and can be activated and proliferate after stimulation with the specific antigen. Donor lymphocytes can be substantially enriched to significant purity by magnetic separation with recombinant MHC multimers and are not activated upon cocultivation with the antigen -presenting cells from HLA - incompatible donors without addition of the specific antigen. This study demonstrated that strong immune response to CMV of healthy donors and prevalence of HLA-A*02 allele in the Russian population make it possible to isolate a significant number of virus-specific cells using HLA-A*02-NLV multimers. After the transfusion, these cells should protect patients from CMV without development of allogeneic immune response."}

In AD a coexistence of perceptual impairment in face and voice processing has also been reported and this could contribute to the altered performance in complex semantic tasks. On the other hand, in SD both face and voice recognition disorders could be related to the prevalence of atrophy in the right temporal lobe (RTL). The aim of the present study was twofold: (1) to investigate famous faces and voices recognition in SD and AD to verify if the two diseases show a differential pattern of impairment, resulting from disruption of different cognitive mechanisms; (2) to check if face and voice recognition disorders prevail in patients with atrophy mainly affecting the RTL. To avoid the potential influence of primary perceptual problems in face and voice recognition, a pool of patients suffering from early SD and AD were administered a detailed set of tests exploring face and voice perception. Thirteen SD (8 with prevalence of right and 5 with prevalence of left temporal atrophy) and 25 CE patients, who did not show visual and auditory perceptual impairment, were finally selected and were administered an experimental battery exploring famous face and voice recognition and naming. Twelve SD patients underwent cerebral PET imaging and were classified in right and left SD according to the onset modality and to the prevalent decrease in FDG uptake in right or left temporal lobe respectively. Correlation of PET imaging and famous face and voice recognition was performed. Results showed a differential performance profile in the two diseases, because AD patients were significantly impaired in the naming tests, but showed preserved recognition, whereas SD patients were profoundly impaired both in naming and in recognition of famous faces and voices. Furthermore, face and voice recognition disorders prevailed in SD patients with RTL atrophy, who also showed a conceptual impairment on the Pyramids and Palm Trees test more important in the pictorial than in the verbal modality. Finally, in 12 SD patients in whom PET was available, a strong correlation between FDG uptake and face-to-name and voice-to-name matching data was found in the right but not in the left temporal lobe. The data support the hypothesis of a different cognitive basis for impairment of face and voice recognition in the two dementias and suggest that the pattern of impairment in SD may be due to a loss of semantic representations, while a defect of semantic control, with impaired naming and preserved recognition might be hypothesized in AD. Furthermore, the correlation between face and voice recognition disorders and RTL damage are consistent with the hypothesis assuming that in the RTL person -specific knowledge may be mainly based upon non-verbal representations."}

However, there is little evidence for a link between blood flow and skin physiology. Therefore, we conducted surveys of healthy volunteers to determine the relationship (s) between dry skin properties and cutaneous vascular function. Water content of the stratum corneum, transepidermal water loss, and visual dryness score were investigated as dry skin parameters. Cutaneous blood flow in the resting state, the recovery rate (RR) of skin temperature on the hand after a cold-stress test, and the responsiveness of facial skin blood flow to local cooling were examined as indices of cutaneous vascular functions. The relationships between dry skin parameters and cutaneous vascular functions were assessed. The RR correlated negatively with the visual dryness score of skin on the leg but correlated positively with water content of the stratum corneum on the arm. No significant correlation between the resting state of blood flow and dry skin parameters was observed. In both the face and the body, deterioration in skin dryness from summer to winter was significant in subjects with low RR. The RR correlated well with the responsiveness of facial skin blood flow to local cooling, indicating that the RR affects systemic dry skin conditions. These results suggest that the RR but not blood flow at the resting state is associated with dry skin conditions and is involved in skin homeostasis during seasonal environmental changes."}

Recent studies have shown that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is associated with tooth loss or soft diet in young animal model, and that BDNF expression is decreased in patients with Alzheimer's disease. However, single or combined effect of tooth loss and/or soft diet on brain function has not fully understood. Here we examined the effect of molar loss and powder diet on memory ability and the expression of BDNF mRNA in the hippocampus of adult C57BL/6J mice. Twenty eight-weeks-old C57BL/6J mice were divided into intact molar group and extracted molar group. They were randomly divided into the I/S group (Intact upper molar teeth / Solid diet feeding), the E/S group (Extracted upper molar teeth / Solid diet feeding), the I/P group (Intact upper molar teeth / Powder diet feeding), and the E/P group (Extracted upper molar teeth / Powder diet feeding). The observation periods were 4 and 16-week. To analyze the memory ability, the step-through passive avoidance test was conducted. BDNF-related mRNA in the hippocampus was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). At 4 weeks later, we performed memory test and isolated brains to analyze. There were no differences in memory function and BDNF mRNA level between these four groups. However, at 16 weeks later, E/S and E/P group showed memory impairment, and decreased level of BDNF mRNA. Whereas, the powder diet had no effect on memory function and BDNF mRNA level even at 16 weeks later.

The college offers PhD programs in these five disciplines: Cancer Biology, Medicinal Chemistry, Pharmaceutics, Pharmacognosy, and Pharmacology. One of the Pharmacognosy dissertations focused on plant-derived natural products with potential anti-inflammatory and cancer chemopreventive activities. Physalis peruviana (Pp) L. originated in tropical South America. It has become naturalized and is found readily on the Island of Hawai'i. The edible fruits are commonly known as cape gooseberry or poha in Hawai'i. In part of our study, three new withanolides, physaperuvin G (1), physaperuvins I-J (2-3), along with four known withanolides, namely, 4\u03b2-hydroxywithanolide E (4), withaperuvin C (5), and physalactone (6), coagulin (7) were isolated from the aerial parts of P. peruviana. In addition, two known compounds, phyperunolide F (8), and withanolide S (9), were isolated and identified from the poha berry fruits. The structures and absolute stereochemistry of new compounds from poha were elucidated by several spectroscopy methods: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and mass spectrometry analyses. All isolated poha compounds (aerial parts and fruits) were evaluated for their anti-inflammatory activity with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cells, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1)-activated nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) with transfected human embryonic kidney cells 293. Most of the isolated natural compounds showed activity with these assays. Additional studies were performed with models of colon cancer. Specifically, 4\u03b2-hydroxywithanolide E (4HWE) inhibited the growth of colon cancer monolayer and spheroid cultures. The compound induced cell cycle arrest at low concentrations and apoptosis at higher concentrations. These data suggest the ingestion of poha berries may have some effect on the prevalence of colon cancer. Additionally, poha isolates compounds were evaluated for their growth inhibitory effects with U251MG glioblastoma and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells that harbor aberrantly-active signal transducer and activation of transcription 3 (STAT3), compared to normal NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts.

Although the etiology of abruption is not fully understood, acute stimuli, such as ischemia and/or inflammation, are associated with rupture of the decidual artery, resulting in placental separation. Ischemia and inflammation are acute biologic effects of air pollution. Using a case-crossover design, we tested the hypothesis that a short-term increase in exposure to air pollutants is a potential trigger of placental abruption. We received data for western Japan (Kyushu-Okinawa Districts) from the Japan Perinatal Registry Network database. From 2005 to 2010, 821 singleton pregnant women with placental abruption were identified. We assigned daily concentrations of air pollutants, including nitrogen dioxide (NO2), suspended particulate matter, ozone, and sulfur dioxide (SO2), from the nearest monitoring station to the respective delivery hospital of each woman. Because information on the onset day of abruption was not obtained, we assumed the case day to be 1 day before the day of delivery. Exposure to NO2 at 2 days' lag was associated with placental abruption (temperature adjusted odds ratio per 10 ppb increase = 1.4; 95% confidence interval = 1.1, 1.8). The association patterns were similar, when we restricted to participants who delivered by emergency cesarean (1.4, 1.1, 1.9), or who delivered after 35 weeks of gestation (1.4, 1.0, 2.0). There was no association with suspended particulate matter, ozone, or SO2.

Depending on tissue types, GAGs exhibit structural heterogeneity such as the position and degree of sulfation or within their disaccharide units composition being heparin, heparan sulfate, chondroitine sulfate, dermatan sulfate, keratan sulfate, and hyaluronic acid. They are covalently linked to a core protein (proteoglycans) or as free chains (hyaluronan). GAGs affect cell properties and functions either by direct interaction with cell receptors or by sequestration of growth factors. These evidences of divert biological roles of GAGs make their characterization at cell and tissue levels of importance. Thus, non-invasive techniques are interesting to investigate, to qualitatively and quantitatively characterize GAGs in vitro in order to use them as diagnostic biomarkers and/or as therapeutic targets in several human diseases including cancer. Infrared and Raman microspectroscopies and imaging are sensitive enough to differentiate and classify GAG types and subtypes in spite of their close molecular structures. Spectroscopic markers characteristic of reference GAG molecules were identified. Beyond these investigations of the standard GAG spectral signature, infrared and Raman spectral signatures of GAG were searched in complex biological systems like cells. The aim of the present review is to describe the implementation of these complementary vibrational spectroscopy techniques, and to discuss their potentials, advantages and disadvantages for GAG analysis. In addition, this review presents new data as we show for the first time GAG infrared and Raman spectral signatures from conditioned media and live cells, respectively."}

Preclinical studies strongly suggest that deregulation of HIF, and particularly HIF2, drives pVHL -defective renal carcinogenesis. Although HIF2\u03b1 was classically considered undruggable, structural and chemical work by Rick Bruick and Kevin Gardner at University of Texas Southwestern laid the foundation for the development of small molecule direct HIF2\u03b1 antagonists (PT2385 and the related tool compound PT2399) by Peloton Therapeutics that block the dimerization of HIF2\u03b1 with its partner protein ARNT1. These compounds inhibit clear cell renal cell carcinoma growth in preclinical models, and PT2385 has now entered the clinic. Nonetheless, the availability of such compounds, together with clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-based gene editing approaches, has revealed a previously unappreciated heterogeneity among clear cell renal carcinomas and patient -derived xenografts with respect to HIF2 dependence, suggesting that predictive biomarkers will be needed to optimize the use of such agents in the clinic."}

More accurate reconstructions of historical states are critical to understanding the processes governing past, current, and future forest dynamics. Here we present new gridded (8x8km) reconstructions of pre-settlement (1800s) forest composition and structure from the upper Midwestern US (Minnesota, Wisconsin, and most of Michigan), using 19th Century Public Land Survey System (PLSS), with estimates of relative composition, above-ground biomass, stem density, and basal area for 28 tree types. This mapping is more robust than past efforts, using spatially varying correction factors to accommodate sampling design, azimuthal censoring, and biases in tree selection. We compare pre-settlement to modern forests using US Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data to show the prevalence of lost forests (pre-settlement forests with no current analog), and novel forests (modern forests with no past analogs). Differences between pre-settlement and modern forests are spatially structured owing to differences in land-use impacts and accompanying ecological responses. Modern forests are more homogeneous, and ecotonal gradients are more diffuse today than in the past. Novel forest assemblages represent 28% of all FIA cells, and 28% of pre-settlement forests no longer exist in a modern context. Lost forests include tamarack forests in northeastern Minnesota, hemlock and cedar dominated forests in north-central Wisconsin and along the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and elm, oak, basswood and ironwood forests along the forest - prairie boundary in south central Minnesota and eastern Wisconsin. Novel FIA forest assemblages are distributed evenly across the region, but novelty shows a strong relationship to spatial distance from remnant forests in the upper Midwest, with novelty predicted at between 20 to 60km from remnants, depending on historical forest type. The spatial relationships between remnant and novel forests, shifts in ecotone structure and the loss of historic forest types point to significant challenges for land managers if landscape restoration is a priority. The spatial signals of novelty and ecological change also point to potential challenges in using modern spatial distributions of species and communities and their relationship to underlying geophysical and climatic attributes in understanding potential responses to changing climate. The signal of human settlement on modern forests is broad, spatially varying and acts to homogenize modern forests relative to their historic counterparts, with significant implications for future management."}

The purpose of this study was to determine the self-reported prevalence of prescription drug use, including medical and nonmedical use, among a nationally representative sample of drivers and to report related driver characteristics. As part of the 2013-2014 National Roadside Survey, drivers from 60 sites were randomly recruited and asked to complete a survey on prescription drug use. Almost 20% of drivers reported using a prescription drug within the past 2 days, with the most common drug class being sedatives (8.0%), followed by antidepressants (7.7%), narcotics (7.5%), and stimulants (3.9%). Drivers who reported prescription drug use were significantly more likely to be female, older, non-Hispanic White, and report disability. Three of four drivers who reported medication use (78.2%) said the drug was prescribed for their use; the odds of using without a prescription were significantly higher for males, Black/African American, and Hispanic drivers, and lower for older drivers. Among those with a prescription, taking more than prescribed was most common for narcotics (6.8%), followed by sedatives (4.8%), stimulants (3.8%), and antidepressants (1.5%). These findings help to identify drivers using potentially impairing prescription drugs, both medically and nonmedically, and may inform the targeting of interventions to reduce impaired driving related to medications."}

Our group and others previously reported that prophylactic enrichment of dietary omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) markedly ameliorate cognitive deficits after TBI. However, it remains unclear whether a clinically relevant therapeutic regimen with n-3 PUFAs administered after TBI would still offer significant improvement of long-term cognitive recovery. In the present study, we employed the decline of spatial cognitive function as a main outcome after TBI to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of post - TBI n-3 PUFA treatment and the underlying mechanisms. Mice were subjected to sham operation or controlled cortical impact, followed by random assignment to receive the following four treatments: (1) vehicle control; (2) daily intraperitoneal injections of n-3 PUFAs for 2 weeks, beginning 2 h after TBI; (3) fish oil dietary supplementation throughout the study, beginning 1 day after TBI; or (4) combination of treatments (2) and (3). Spatial cognitive deficits and chronic brain tissue loss, as well as endogenous brain repair processes such as neurogenesis, angiogenesis, and oligodendrogenesis, were evaluated up to 35 days after TBI. The results revealed prominent spatial cognitive deficits and massive tissue loss caused by TBI. Among all mice receiving post-TBI n-3 PUFA treatments, the combined treatment of fish oil dietary supplement and n-3 PUFA injections demonstrated a reproducible beneficial effect in attenuating cognitive deficits although without reducing gross tissue loss. Mechanistically, the combined treatment promoted post-TBI restorative processes in the brain, including generation of immature neurons, microvessels, and oligodendrocytes, each of which was significantly correlated with the improved cognitive recovery. These results indicated that repetitive and prolonged n-3 PUFA treatments after TBI are capable of enhancing brain remodeling and could be developed as a potential therapy to treat TBI victims in the clinic."}

Due to the complexity of the process, the investigation of the constituent profile during fermentation is difficult. Metabolomics, the comprehensive study of low molecular weight compounds in biological samples, is thought to be a promising strategy for deep understanding of the constituent contribution to food flavor characteristics. Therefore, metabolomics is suitable for the analysis of soy sauce fermentation. Unfortunately, only few and unrefined studies of soy sauce fermentation using metabolomics approach have been reported. Therefore, we investigated changes in low molecular weight hydrophilic and volatile compounds of soy sauce using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS)- based non-targeted metabolic profiling. The data were analyzed by statistical analysis to evaluate influences of yeast and lactic acid bacterium on the constituent profile. Consequently, our results suggested a novel finding that lactic acid bacterium affected the production of several constituents such as cyclotene, furfural, furfuryl alcohol and methional in the soy sauce fermentation process."}

Participants performed 6x100 m sprints at 60-70% of their maximal 100 m sprinting speed twice a week for 6 weeks, either with (IG; n=12) or without pBFR (CG; n=12). The 100 m dash time significantly decreased more in the IG (-0.38\u00b10.24 s) than in the CG (-0.16\u00b10.17 s). The muscle thickness of the rectus femoris increased only in the IG, while no group by time interactions were found for the muscle thickness of the biceps femoris and the biceps brachii. The maximal isometric force, measured using a leg press, did not change in either group. However, the rate of force development improved in the IG. Growth hormone, testosterone, insulin-like growth factor 1, and cortisol concentrations did not significantly differ between both groups at any measurement time point (pre, 1 min, 20 min, 120 min, and 24 h after the six all-out sprints of the first training session). The muscle damage marker h-FABP increased significantly more in the CG than in the IG. The pBFR improved the 100 m dash time significantly more than low - intensity sprint interval training alone. Other noted benefits of training with pBFR were a decreased level of muscle damage, a greater increase of the rectus femoris muscle thickness, and a higher rate of force development. However, the tested hormones were unable to explain the additional beneficial effects."}

However, little is known about the effects of this sedation on the brain connectivity patterns in the damaged brain essential for differential diagnosis. In this study, we aimed to assess these effects. Using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging 3T data obtained over several years of scanning patients for diagnostic and research purposes, we employed a seed-based approach to examine resting state connectivity in higher-order (default mode, bilateral external control, and salience) and lower-order (auditory, sensorimotor, and visual) resting state networks and connectivity with the thalamus, in 20 healthy unsedated controls, 8 unsedated patients with DOC, and 8 patients with DOC sedated with propofol. The DOC groups were matched for age at onset, etiology, time spent in DOC, diagnosis, standardized behavioral assessment scores, movement intensities, and pattern of structural brain injury (as assessed with T1-based voxel-based morphometry). DOC were associated with severely impaired resting state network connectivity in all but the visual network. Thalamic connectivity to higher-order network regions was also reduced. Propofol administration to patients was associated with minor further decreases in thalamic and insular connectivity. Our findings indicate that connectivity decreases associated with propofol sedation, involving the thalamus and insula, are relatively small compared with those already caused by DOC -associated structural brain injury. Nonetheless, given the known importance of the thalamus in brain arousal, its disruption could well reflect the diminished movement obtained in these patients. However, more research is needed on this topic to fully address the research question."}

Mutations in KLHL3 cause constitutively increased renal salt reabsorption and impaired K(+) secretion, resulting in hypertension and hyperkalemia. Although clinical studies have shown that dietary K(+) intake affects blood pressure, the mechanisms have been obscure. In this study, we demonstrate that the KLHL3 ubiquitin ligase complex is involved in the low- K(+) -mediated activation of Na-Cl cotransporter (NCC) in the kidney. In the distal convoluted tubules of mice eating a low-K(+) diet, we found increased KLHL3 phosphorylation at S433 (KLHL3(S433-P)), a modification that impairs WNK binding, and also reduced total KLHL3 levels. These changes are accompanied by the accumulation of the target substrate WNK4, and activation of the downstream kinases SPAK (STE20 / SPS1 -related proline-alanine-rich protein kinase) and OSR1 (oxidative stress-responsive 1), resulting in NCC phosphorylation and its accumulation at the plasma membrane. Increased phosphorylation of S433 was explained by increased levels of active, phosphorylated protein kinase C (but not protein kinase A), which directly phosphorylates S433. Moreover, in HEK cells expressing KLHL3 and WNK4, we showed that the activation of protein kinase C by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate induces KLHL3(S433-P) and increases WNK4 levels by abrogating its ubiquitination. These data demonstrate the role of KLHL3 in low- K(+) -mediated induction of NCC; this physiologic adaptation reduces distal electrogenic Na(+) reabsorption, preventing further renal K(+) loss but promoting increased blood pressure."}

The Washington State Comprehensive Hospital Abstract Reporting System includes claims from all hospital discharges in Washington. We identified patients with FG between 2007 and 2013, based on diagnosis and treatment codes. Analyses were stratified by center volume (low-volume centers [LVCs] or high-volume centers [HVCs]), and transfer status. Variables of interest included number of debridements, septic shock, acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure, length of hospitalization, and death. We identified 165 FG patients. Only 1 HVC treated more than 2 FG patients per year. Overall mortality was 6.7%. Most patients (57%) were treated entirely at LVCs; 87% of patients treated at the HVC were transferred from an LVC. High-volume center -treated patients had similar baseline comorbidities (p = 0.77) and similar mortality (p = 0.87), despite higher rates of septic shock (p < 0.01) and respiratory failure (p = 0.01) compared with LVC patients.

The absence of a continuous in vitro culture system for any species of Pneumocystis has led to limited understanding of these fungi, especially for the discovery of new therapies. We recently reported that Pneumocystis carinii, Pneumocystis murina, and most significantly, Pneumocystis jirovecii lack both enzymes necessary for myo-inositol biosynthesis but contain genes with homologies to fungal myo-inositol transporters. Since myo-inositol is essential for eukaryotic viability, the primary transporter, ITR1, was functionally and structurally characterized in P. carinii The predicted structure of P. carinii ITR1 (PcITR1) contained 12 transmembrane alpha-helices with intracellular C and N termini, consistent with other inositol transporters. The apparent Km was 0.94 \u00b1 0.08 (mean \u00b1 standard deviation), suggesting that myo-inositol transport in P. carinii is likely through a low-affinity, highly selective transport system, as no other sugars or inositol stereoisomers were significant competitive inhibitors. Glucose transport was shown to use a different transport system. The myo-inositol transport was distinct from mammalian transporters, as it was not sodium dependent and was cytochalasin B resistant. Inositol transport in these fungi offers an attractive new drug target because of the reliance of the fungi on its transport, clear differences between the mammalian and fungal transporters, and the ability of the host to both synthesize and transport this critical nutrient, predicting low toxicity of potential inhibitors to the fungal transporter. myo-Inositol is a sugarlike nutrient that is essential for life in most organisms. Humans and microbes alike can obtain it by making it, which involves only 2 enzymes, by taking it from the environment by a transport process, or by recycling it from other cellular constituents. Inspection of the genomes of the pathogenic fungi of the genus Pneumocystis showed that these pneumonia - causing parasites could not make myo-inositol, as they lacked the 2 enzymes. Instead, we found evidence of inositol transporters, which would import the sugar from the lungs where the fungi reside. In the present report, we characterized the transport of myo-inositol in the fungus and found that the transporter was highly selective for myo-inositol and did not transport any other molecules. The transport was distinct from that in mammalian cells, and since mammals can both make and transport myo-inositol, while Pneumocystis fungi must transport it, this process offers a potential new drug target."}

The results indicated that scoparone suppresses the LPS - stimulated increase of neuroinflammatory responses and inhibited the pro-inflammatory cytokine production in the BV-2 microglial cells. A mechanistic study showed that scoparone specifically inhibited the LPS - stimulated activation via a major regulation of IRF-3 and a regulation of ERK, whereby the phosphorylation in the BV-2 microglial cells is blocked.

The described procedure for efficient genome editing can be applied to any cell type to study physiological and pathophysiological functions in the context of precisely engineered genotypes."}

While the evaluation of RV performance at rest has been implemented in the clinical setting, it is unknown whether this assessment during exercise may provide additional benefit. With this aim, we evaluated the exercise - induced pulmonary arterial systolic pressure (PASP) increase during exercise in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as an expression of RV contractile reserve. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) with synchronic echocardiography was performed in 81 patients. Patients were classified into two groups according to an exercise - induced PASP increase above 30mmHg (High PSAP) or below 30mmHg (Low PSAP) during maximal exercise. Patients were then followed for three years. Sixteen patients (20%) had low PSAP and 65 (80%) showed high PSAP. These were not significant clinical and functional differences. Low PSAP was associated with a significantly lower peak VO2 (mean (SD), 35 (2) % predicted) compared to high PSAP response (peak VO2 45 (3) % predicted), p=0.045. Factors associated with mortality were age and exercise - induced PASP. Seventeen patients died during the three years of follow-up (7 (39%) in the low PSAP group and only 10 (1%) in the high PSAP group, p=0.041). Cardiopulmonary exercise testing with a synchronic echocardiography may be a useful tool for the assessment of RV contractile reserve in severe COPD patients. Exercise - induced PSAP emerges as a possible prognostic factor in these patients."}

To carry out the ecohydrological modeling, the following information was used: bathymetry, physical and hydraulic features, and the Habitat Suitability Index for species of the Hypostomus auroguttatus. In the River2D, the Weighted Usable Areas were determined from the average long-term streamflows with percentage from 10% to 100%. Those streamflows were simulated for the later construction of optimization matrices that maximize the habitat area throughout the year. For H. auroguttatus Juvenile, higher values of Weighted Usable Area were associated with the percentage of 60% and 70% of the average long-term streamflows in October and September, respectively. For H. auroguttatus Adult, the highest value of Weighted Usable Area was associated with the percentage of 100% of the average long-term streamflow in September. The environmental flows found for this stretch of the Formoso River varied over the year. The lowest environmental flow was observed in December (2.85 m3 s-1), while the highest was observed in May (4.13 m3 s-1).

Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to compute hazard ratios (HRs) for diabetes in relation to breast cancer mortality and all-cause mortality, with adjustment for age, stage, treatment modality, estrogen receptor (ER) status, and body mass index. There were 368 deaths during follow-up, of which 273 were due to breast cancer. Breast cancer mortality was significantly increased in women who had been diagnosed with diabetes at least 5 years before breast cancer occurrence, HR 1.86 (95% CI 1.20-2.89), with elevations observed for both ER+ and ER- breast cancer. All-cause mortality was also higher in diabetics, with HRs of 1.54 (95% CI 1.12-2.07) overall and 2.26 (95% CI 1.62-3.15) for \u22655-year duration of diabetes relative to non-diabetics.

The classic triad of oral and genital ulcerations in conjunction with uveitis was originally described by the Turkish dermatologist Hulusi Behcet in 1937, but associated symptoms of the cardiovascular, central nervous, pulmonary, and gastrointestinal systems were later identified. In fact, Behcet's disease with neurological involvement (neuro-Behcet's disease) is not uncommon. Patients with neuro-Behcet's disease typically exhibit a diverse array of symptoms, most commonly in the brainstem and diencephalic regions. Herein, we report an unusual case of neuro-Behcet's disease in a patient who presented with a solitary cerebellar hemorrhage. A 39-year-old Asian woman was admitted to our hospital with complaints of a sudden speech difficulty that had manifested the same morning, and dizziness and mild vomiting experienced over the previous 3 days. Magnetic resonance images revealed target-like hemorrhagic lesions in the right hemisphere of the cerebellum. Risk factors that may result in cerebellar hemorrhage, such as high blood pressure or bleeding diathesis, were ruled out, and subsequent brain angiograms were normal. These findings suggest that the patient's cerebellar hemorrhage could have been due to intracranial vasculitis in a rare, if not unique, complication of neuro-Behcet's disease."}

Reportedly, bacterial resistance to rifampicin is associated with polymorphisms in the target gene rpoB or the presence of enzymes that modify and thereby inactivate rifampicin. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the MAB_0591 (arrMab)-encoded rifampicin ADP-ribosyltransferase (Arr_Mab) in innate high-level rifampicin resistance in M. abscessus. Recombinant Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains expressing MAB_0591 were generated, as was an M. abscessus deletion mutant deficient for MAB_0591. MIC assays were used to study susceptibility to rifampicin and C25 carbamate -modified rifamycin derivatives. Heterologous expression of MAB_0591 conferred rifampicin resistance to E. coli and M. tuberculosis Rifamycin MIC values were consistently lower for the M. abscessus \u0394arrMab mutant as compared with the M. abscessus ATCC 19977 parental type strain. The rifamycin WT phenotype was restored after complementation of the M. abscessus \u0394arrMab mutant with arrMab Further MIC data demonstrated that a C25 modification increases rifamycin activity in WT M. abscessus However, MIC studies in the M. abscessus \u0394arrMab mutant suggest that C25 modified rifamycins are still subject to modification by Arr_Mab CONCLUSIONS: Our findings identify Arr_Mab as the major innate rifamycin resistance determinant of M. abscessus.

Ectopic location of these adenomas is an extremely rare condition that may compromise the diagnosis and surgical success. We present the first case of an ectopic intracavernous ACTH-secreting macroadenoma totally resected with endoscopic endonasal surgery (EES). A 36 year old female presented with Cushing syndrome. Increased ACTH, serum cortisol and free urine cortisol levels were identified, however the pituitary MRI failed to reveal a pituitary tumor; instead, a parasellar lesion in the left cavernous sinus (CS) was noticed. Inferior petrosal sinus sampling demonstrated a significant central -to- peripheral and lateralized left-sided ACTH gradient. The patient underwent EES. No tumor was found in the sella, however, the left CS was widely explored and a tumor was found lateral to the paraclival segment of the carotid artery. There were no complications following EES. Pathology confirmed the diagnosis of an ACTH-secreting adenoma. During the immediately postoperative course serum cortisol levels dropped below 5 mcg/dl. Postoperative MRI demonstrated complete tumor resection. At 20 months follow-up, the patient remains in clinical and biochemical remission of Cushing's Disease. Only 12 cases of ectopic intracavernous ACTH-secreting adenomas have been reported to date and all were microadenomas. The presence of an ectopic ACTH-secreting macroadenoma in the CS represents a surgical challenge. EES is the ideal approach for complete resection of ectopic intracavernous adenomas allowing for a wide exploration of the CS with no surgical complications."}

Thyroid-specific cancer mortality may be the most ambitious endpoint for obtaining estimates of screening effect. Numerous observations have accumulated over the years, indicating that thyroid cancer mortality endpoint has been difficult to study and is confounded by population heterogeneity, provision of randomization, and requirement of large cohorts with sufficiently long follow-up due to the excellent prognosis of the cancer. Accordingly, it may be important to reconsider how to best measure thyroid cancer screening efficacy. Recommendations against thyroid cancer screening should be based upon trials designed to evaluate its effectiveness not only in significant reduction in cancer mortality, but also of other distinct endpoint s. It is desirable to evaluate derivative endpoints that can reliably predict reductions in mortality. The term \"derivative\" means a variable that is related to the true endpoint and is likely to be observable before the primary endpoint. Derivative endpoints may include thyroid cancer incidence, the proportion of early-stage tumors detected, more treatable stage, the identification of small tumors (to maintain in observation), decrease in the number of people who develop metastatic disease, the increased chance of lesser extent surgery, and the application of minimally invasive approaches, as well as no need for lifelong thyroid replacement therapy, a consistent follow-up, low-dose or no RAI administration and risk factor assessments where case findings should be continuous. The Korean guidelines for thyroid cancer national-level screening were published by a relevant group of multidisciplinary thyroid experts. It was concluded that the evidence is insufficient to balance the benefits and harms of thyroid cancer screening. However, the paper seems to raise the necessary investments in future research and demand a complete analysis for derivative endpoints, and offer screening participants with complete information necessary to make decisions that will provide them with the most value when a small thyroid cancer is screen- identified."}

In zebrafish, the adult body stripes are generated by coordinated rearrangement of three distinct pigment cell-types, black melanocytes, shiny iridophores and yellow xanthophores. A stem cell origin of melanocytes and iridophores has been proposed although the potency of those stem cells has remained unclear. Xanthophores, however, seemed to originate predominantly from proliferation of embryonic xanthophores. Now, data from Singh et al. shows that all three cell-types derive from shared stem cells, and that these cells generate peripheral neural cell-types too. Furthermore, clonal compositions are best explained by a progressive fate restriction model generating the individual cell-types. The numbers of adult pigment stem cells associated with the dorsal root ganglia remain low, but progenitor numbers increase significantly during larval development up to metamorphosis, likely via production of partially restricted progenitors on the spinal nerves."}

Existing small-molecule modulators of V-ATPase either are restricted to targeting one membranous subunit of V-ATPase or have poorly understood mechanisms of action. Small molecules with novel and defined mechanisms of inhibition are thus needed to functionally characterize V-ATPase and to fully evaluate the therapeutic relevance of V-ATPase in human diseases. We have discovered electrophilic quinazolines that covalently modify a soluble catalytic subunit of V-ATPase with high potency and exquisite proteomic selectivity as revealed by fluorescence imaging and chemical proteomic activity-based profiling. The site of covalent modification was mapped to a cysteine residue located in a region of V-ATPase subunit A that is thought to regulate the dissociation of V-ATPase. We further demonstrate that a previously reported V-ATPase inhibitor, 3-bromopyruvate, also targets the same cysteine residue and that our electrophilic quinazolines modulate the function of V-ATPase in cells. With their well-defined mechanism of action and high proteomic specificity, the described quinazolines offer a powerful set of chemical probes to investigate the physiological and pathological roles of V-ATPase."}

In radiation therapy of GBM the relevant metabolic tumor volumes (MTVs) are related to aberrant levels of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) and choline (Cho). The corresponding clinical target volumes (CTVs) for radiation therapy are based on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (CE-T1w) and T2-weighted (T2w)/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI. Necrotic portions, enhancing lesion, and edema were manually contoured on CE-T1w / T2w images for 17 GBM patients. Clinical target volumes and MTVs for NAA (MTVNAA) and Cho (MTVCho) were constructed. Imaging and metabolic features related to size, shape, and signal intensities of the volumes were extracted. Tumors were also scored categorically for 10 semantic imaging traits by a neuroradiologist. All features were investigated for redundancy. Two-way correlations between imaging and CTVs / MTVs features were visualized as heatmaps. Associations between MTVNAA and MTVCho and imaging features were studied using Spearman correlation. Forty-eight imaging features were extracted per patient. Half of the imaging traits were replaced with automatically extracted continuous variables. Twenty features were extracted from CTVs and MTVs. A series of semantic imaging traits were replaced with automatically extracted continuous variables. There were multiple (22) significant correlations of imaging measures with CTVs / MTVNAA, whereas there were only 6 with CTVs / MTVCho.

We devised an arterial spin labeling (ASL) method based on the principle of MR fingerprinting (MRF), referred to as MRF-ASL. By taking advantage of the rich information contained in MRF sequence, up to seven hemodynamic parameters can be estimated concomitantly. Feasibility demonstration, flip angle optimization, comparison with Look-Locker ASL, reproducibility test, sensitivity to hypercapnia challenge, and initial clinical application in an intracranial steno-occlusive process, Moyamoya disease, were performed to evaluate this technique. Magnetic resonance fingerprinting ASL provided estimation of up to seven parameters, including B1+, tissue T1, cerebral blood flow (CBF), tissue bolus arrival time (BAT), pass-through arterial BAT, pass-through blood volume, and pass-through blood travel time. Coefficients of variation of the estimated parameters ranged from 0.2 to 9.6%. Hypercapnia resulted in an increase in CBF by 57.7%, and a decrease in BAT by 13.7 and 24.8% in tissue and vessels, respectively. Patients with Moyamoya disease showed diminished CBF and lengthened BAT that could not be detected with regular ASL.

Because few data exist about the sensitivity of Branchinecta spp. to toxic effects of contaminants, it is difficult to determine whether they are adequately protected by water quality criteria. A series of acute (24-h) lethality/immobilization tests was conducted with 3 species of fairy shrimp (B. lynchi, Branchinecta lindahli, and Thamnocephalus platyurus) and 10 chemicals with varying modes of toxic action: ammonia, potassium, chloride, sulfate, chromium(VI), copper, nickel, zinc, alachlor, and metolachlor. The same chemicals were tested in 48- h tests with other branchiopods (the cladocerans Daphnia magna and Ceriodaphnia dubia) and an amphipod (Hyalella azteca), and in 96- h tests with snails (Physa gyrina and Lymnaea stagnalis). Median effect concentrations (EC50s) for B. lynchi were strongly correlated (r(2) = 0.975) with EC50s for the commercially available fairy shrimp species T. platyurus for most chemicals tested. Comparison of EC50s for fairy shrimp and EC50s for invertebrate taxa tested concurrently and with other published toxicity data indicated that fairy shrimp were relatively sensitive to potassium and several trace metals compared with other invertebrate taxa, although cladocerans, amphipods, and mussels had similar broad toxicant sensitivity. Interspecies correlation estimation models for predicting toxicity to fairy shrimp from surrogate species indicated that models with cladocerans and freshwater mussels as surrogates produced the best predictions of the sensitivity of fairy shrimp to contaminants. The results of these studies indicate that fairy shrimp are relatively sensitive to a range of toxicants, but Endangered Species Act -listed fairy shrimp of the genus Branchinecta were not consistently more sensitive than other fairy shrimp taxa.

Tensile strength (\u03c3), Young's modulus (E), and elongation at break (%) values were calculated as 0.29\u00b10.03MPa and 0.21\u00b10.03; 0.38\u00b10.02 and 1.95\u00b10.4; and 240\u00b150% and 24\u00b12% for PGS and PGS / \u03b2-TCP bi-layered constructs, respectively. Morphology was characterized by using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and micro-computed tomography (\u03bc-CT). Tomography data revealed an open porosity of 35% for the construct, mostly contributed from the ceramic phase since the elastomer side has no pore. Homogeneous \u03b2-TCP distribution within the elastomeric structure was observed. Cell culture studies confirmed biocompatibility with poor elastomer - side and good bone - side cell attachment. In a further study to investigate the osteogenic properties, the construct were loaded with BMP-2 and/or TGF-\u03b21. The PGS / \u03b2-TCP bi-layered constructs with improved mechanical and biological properties have the potential to be used in bone-soft tissue interface applications where soft tissue penetration is a problem."}

However, which factors contribute to the deterioration of cardiometabolic health in postmenopausal women is debated as the menopausal transition is also associated with increased age and fat mass. Furthermore, indications of reduced cardiometabolic adaptations to exercise in postmenopausal women add to the adverse health profile. We sought to evaluate risk factors for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in late premenopausal and early postmenopausal women, matched by age and body composition, and investigate the effect of high-intensity training. A 3-month high-intensity aerobic training intervention, involving healthy, nonobese, late premenopausal (n = 40) and early postmenopausal (n = 39) women was conducted and anthropometrics, body composition, blood pressure, lipid profile, glucose tolerance, and maximal oxygen consumption were determined at baseline and after the intervention. At baseline, the groups matched in anthropometrics and body composition, and only differed by 4.2 years in age (mean [95% confidence limits] 49.2 [48.5-49.9] vs 53.4 [52.4-54.4] years). Time since last menstrual period for the postmenopausal women was (mean [95% confidecnce limits] 3.1 [2.6-3.7] years). Hormonal levels (estrogen, follicle stimulation hormone, luteinizing hormone) confirmed menopausal status. At baseline the postmenopausal women had higher total cholesterol (P < .001), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (P < .05), and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (P < .001) than the premenopausal women. The training intervention reduced body weight (P < .01), waist circumference (P < .01), and improved body composition by increasing lean body mass (P < .001) and decreasing fat mass (P < .001) similarly in both groups. Moreover, training resulted in lower diastolic blood pressure (P < .05), resting heart rate (P < .001), total cholesterol (P < .01), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (P < .01), total cholesterol / high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol index (P < .01), and improved plasma insulin concentration during the oral glucose tolerance test (P < .05) in both groups. Cardiovascular risk factors are similar in late premenopausal and early postmenopausal women, matched by age and body composition, with the exception that postmenopausal women have higher high- and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels. A 3-month intervention of high-intensity aerobic training reduces risk factors for type 2 .diabetes and cardiovascular disease to a similar extent in late premenopausal and early postmenopausal women."}

The aims of this study were to investigate the relationships between preoperative physical signs and postoperative functional outcomes in patients with OPLL and to clarify whether physical signs could predict functional outcomes. Fifty-five patients with OPLL who had undergone cervical laminoplasty were included in this study. Six physical signs including hyperreflexia, Babinski sign, sensory disturbance, grip strength, 10-s grip and release test, and bladder dysfunction, and four other factors including age, duration of symptoms, history of minor trauma and preoperative Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score were investigated as potential predictive prognostic factors using both univariate and multivariate analyses. The mean recovery rate of JOA score was 62.5 \u00b1 32.5%. The neurological recovery rate was negatively associated with age (P = 0.002), the duration of symptoms (P = 0.002) and Babinski sign (P = 0.007), whereas it was positively correlated with grip strength (P = 0.011). Multiple logistic regression analyses revealed that age (Odds ratio: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.81-0.99) and Babinski sign (Odds ratio: 0.18, 95% CI: 0.04-0.89) were factors associated with functional outcomes. Satisfactory functional outcomes could be expected for patients who are young and do not exhibit the Babinski sign, showing that the Babinski sign could be useful as an indicator of the window of opportunity for achieving satisfactory functional outcomes."}

This study provides the first data on the microbiota living inside the gut of the larvae of M. dusmeti, as well as the microbiota in the hollow where these larvae develop. Bacteria were identified by amplification and partial sequencing of the V1-V3 regions and the complete nucleotide sequence of 16S rRNA genes. We found eight species of bacteria living in tree hollows and three species in the gut of M. dusmeti larvae: Bacillus cereus, Bacillus toyonensis, and Lysinibacillus sphaericus The filter-feeding mechanism characteristic of M. dusmeti larvae is selective in enabling ingestion of bacteria only above 2.1 \u00b5m in diameter."}

The sample was composed of 184 adolescents divided into three groups (impact sports [n = 102]; swimming [n = 35]; non-sports [n = 47]). The occurrence of stress fracture was reported by participants and coaches. As potential confounders we considered age, sex, resistance training, body composition variables and age at peak of height velocity. There were 13 adolescents who reported fractures during the 9- month period. Bone mineral density values were higher in adolescents engaged in impact sports (P-value = 0.002). Independently of confounders, the risk of stress fracture was lower in adolescents engaged in impact sports than in non-active adolescents (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.23 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.05 to 0.98]), while swimming practice was not associated to lower risk of fracture (HR = 0.49 [95% CI = 0.09 to 2.55]). In conclusion, the findings from this study indicate the importance of sports participation among adolescents in the reduction of stress fracture risk, especially with impact sports. More importantly, these results could be relevant for recognising adolescents in danger of not reaching their potential for peak bone mass and later an increased risk of fractures."}

The technological advancements that triggered an industrial complex and ended World War II demanded radiation safety on an unprecedented scale. Until then, protective measures against radiation were largely absent in laboratories. Over the subsequent decades, health physicists began protecting people and the environment in a wide range of settings including medical, research, and industrial. The use of radioactive materials and radiation-generating devices is prevalent today. Radiation doses occur continuously including during airline flights, in our homes, during medical procedures, and in energy production. Radiation is integral to numerous applications including those in medicine, dentistry, manufacturing, construction, scientific research, nuclear electric power generation, and oil and gas exploration. Activities that were once groundbreaking have now become routine and scripted. At higher doses, health effects are understood and avoided. Instruments for the detection and measurement of radiation are at times smarter than their users. Ironically, the same health physics community that has been successful in demonstrating that exposures to radiation and to radioactive materials can be effectively managed is shrinking at an increasingly rapid rate. This paper highlights the creation of past and current jobs, predicts the future opportunities in the profession, and makes recommendations necessary to protect the disappearing specialties."}

We aim to investigate if ITPR3 genetic polymorphisms are associated with the risk of cervical cancer in Taiwanese women. ITPR3 rs3748079 A/G and rs2229634 C/T polymorphisms were genotyped in a hospital-based study of 462 women with cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) and 921 age-matched healthy control women. The presence and genotypes of HPV in CSCC was determined. No significant association of individual ITPR3 variants were found among controls, CSCC, and HPV-16 positive CSCC. However, we found a significant association of haplotype AT between CSCC and controls (OR = 2.28, 95% CI 1.31-3.97, P = 2.83 \u00d7 10-3) and the OR increased further in CSCC patients infected with HPV-16 (OR = 2.89, 95% CI 1.55-5.37, P = 4.54 \u00d7 10-4).

Because of the high likelihood of secondary findings associated with this technique, the process of informing patients is beset with new challenges. One of them is regarding the type of secondary findings that ought to be disclosed to patients. The aim of this research is to propose a practical implementation of the notion of actionability, a common criteria justifying the disclosure of secondary findings but whose interpretation varies greatly among professionals. We distinguish three types of actionability corresponding to (1) well-established medical actions, (2) patient -initiated health-related actions and (3) life-plan decisions. We argue that actionability depends on the characteristics of the mutation or gene and on the values of patients. In discussing the return of secondary findings, it is important that the physician tries to get an impression of the specific situation and values of patients. Regarding variants of uncertain clinical significance in actionable genes, we found that different understandings of autonomy lead to different conclusions and that, for some of them, it may be legitimate to refrain from returning uncertain information."}

Of 34 donors recruited having self-reported shrimp allergy, only 35% had significant levels of shrimp-specific IgE in serum and measurable basophil secretory responses to rPen a 1 (shrimp tropomyosin). We report that degranulation is linked to the number of Fc\u03b5RI occupied with allergen-specific IgE, as well as the dose and valency of Pen a 1. Using clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeat-based gene editing, human RBL(r\u03b1KO) cells were created that exclusively express the human Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 subunit. Pen a 1 - specific IgE was affinity purified from shrimp - positive plasma. Cells primed with a range of Pen a 1 - specific IgE and challenged with Pen a 1 showed a bell-shaped dose response for secretion, with optimal Pen a 1 doses of 0.1-10 ng/ml. Mathematical modeling provided estimates of receptor aggregation kinetics based on Fc\u03b5RI occupancy with IgE and allergen dose. Maximal degranulation was elicited when \u223c2700 I gE - Fc\u03b5RI complexes were occupied with specific IgE and challenged with Pen a 1 (IgE epitope valency of \u22658), although measurable responses were achieved when only a few hundred Fc\u03b5RI were occupied. Prolonged periods of pepsin -mediated Pen a 1 proteolysis, which simulates gastric digestion, were required to diminish secretory responses. Recombinant fragments (60-79 aa), which together span the entire length of tropomyosin, were weak secretagogues. These fragments have reduced dimerization capacity, compete with intact Pen a 1 for binding to IgE - Fc\u03b5RI complexes, and represent a starting point for the design of promising hypoallergens for immunotherapy."}

The present study aimed to identify key parameters influencing N utilization efficiency and develop prediction equations for manure N, feces N, and urine N outputs in sheep. Data used were collected from 82 sheep offered fresh perennial ryegrass () as the sole diet in 6 metabolism experiments (data from non-grass-only diets were not used). Sheep were from breeds of Highlander, Texel, Scottish Blackface, and Swaledale at the age of 5 to 18 mo and weighing from 24.5 to 62.7 kg. Herbage was harvested daily from 6 swards of contrasting harvest dates (May to December), offering wide variation in feed value to cover the range that would be offered in most practical farm situations. Before the commencement of each study, the experimental sward was harvested at a residual height of 4 cm and allowed to grow for 2 to 4 wk to target an average pregrazing sward height in a range of 8 to 15 cm depending on the time of year. Sheep were housed in individual pens for 14 d and then transferred to individual metabolism crates for 4 d with feed intake and feces and urine outputs measured. Data were analyzed using the linear mixed model procedure to develop prediction equations for feces N, urine N, and manure N outputs using N intake, herbage chemical composition, and digestibility with effects of sex, breed, and experimental periods removed. Nitrogen intake was the best single predictor for N output in feces, urine, and manure, and the value for prediction of manure N output was greater than those for feces N and urine N (0.86 vs. 0.70 and 0.77, respectively; < 0.001). Animal BW and herbage DM, ether extract, NDF, ADF, water soluble carbohydrate, and DE concentrations and N digestibility were also used to predict N outputs because N intake may not be available in commercial practice. The prediction equations for N utilizatio n efficiency indicated that increasing feeding level and ME concentration and reducing N concentration could improve N utilization efficiency and shift N excretion into feces rather than urine (< 0.001). The equations developed in the current study provide an approach for sheep producers to quantify N excretion against production and, consequently, to develop their own mitigation strategies to reduce the environmental impact of sheep production systems."}

Na\u00efve Bayesian formula is the highly accepted method to integrate different PPI datasets into a single weighted PPI network, but detecting proper weights in such network is still a major problem. In this paper, we proposed a new methodology to integrate various physical PPI datasets into a single weighted PPI network in a way that the detected modules in PPI network exhibit the highest similarity to available functional modules. We used the co-expression modules as functional modules, and we shown that direct functional modules detected from Gene Ontology terms could be used as an alternative dataset. After running this integrating methodology over six different physical PPI datasets, orthologous high-confidence interactions from a related organism and two AP-MS PPI datasets gained high weights in the integrated networks, while the weights for one AP-MS PPI dataset and two other datasets derived from public databases have converged to zero. The majority of detected modules shaped around one or few hub protein(s).

{"document_id": "28055142", "text": "Executive functions deficits impair extinction of generalization of fear of movement-related pain Generalization of fear of movement-related pain across novel but similar movements can lead to fear responses to movements that are actually not associated with pain. The peak-shift effect describes a phenomenon whereby particular novel movements elicit even greater fear responses than the original pain-provoking movement (CS+), because they represent a more extreme version of the CS+. There is great variance in the propensity to generalize as well as the speed of extinction learning when these novel movements are not followed by pain. It can be argued that this variance may be associated with executive function capacity, as individuals may be unable to intentionally inhibit fear responses. This study examined whether executive function capacity contributes to generalization and extinction of generalization as well as peak-shift of conditioned fear of movement-related pain and expectancy. Healthy participants performed a proprioceptive fear conditioning task. Executive function tests assessing updating, switching, and inhibition were used to predict changes in (extinction of) fear of movement-related pain and pain expectancy generalization. Low inhibitory capacity was associated with slower extinction of generalized fear of movement-related pain and pain expectancy. Evidence was found in favor of an area-shift, rather than a peak-shift effect, which implies that the peak conditioned fear response extended to, but did not shift to a novel stimulus. Participants with low inhibitory capacity may have difficulties withholding fear responses, leading to a slower decrease of generalized fear over time. The findings may be relevant to inform treatments. Low inhibitory capacity is not associated with slower generalization, but extinction of fear generalization. Fear elicited by a novel safe movement, situated outside the CS+/- continuum on the CS+ side, can be as strong as to the original stimulus predicting the pain-onset."}

Compelling evidence has demonstrated that interventions investing in maternal health in the first 1000 days of life are beneficial for both mothers and their children. One such potential intervention is deworming integrated into maternal postpartum care in areas where soil - transmitted helminth (STH) infections are endemic. From February to August 2014, 1010 mother - infant pairs were recruited into a trial aimed at assessing the effectiveness of maternal postpartum deworming on infant and maternal health outcomes. Following delivery, mothers were randomly assigned to receive either single- dose 400 mg albendazole or placebo. Participants were followed-up at 1 and 6 months postpartum. There was no statistically significant difference in mean weight gain between infants in the experimental and control groups (mean difference: -0.02; 95% CI: -0.1, 0.08) at 6 months of age. Further, deworming had no effect on measured infant morbidity indicators. However, ad hoc analyses restricted to mothers who tested positive for STHs at baseline suggest that infants of mothers in the experimental group had greater mean length gain in cm (mean difference: 0.8; 95% CI: 0.1, 1.4) and length-for-age z-score (mean difference: 0.5; 95% CI: 0.2, 0.8) at 6 months of age. In a study population composed of both STH-infected and uninfected mothers, maternal postpartum deworming was insufficient to impact infant growth and morbidity indicators up to 6 months postpartum. Among STH-infected mothers, however, important improvements in infant length gain and length-for-age were observed. The benefits of maternal postpartum deworming should be further investigated in study populations having higher overall prevalences and intensities of STH infections and, in particular, where whipworm and hookworm infections are of public health concern.

On the one hand, this technique allows a better and direct visualization of vascular and solid organ lesions. On the other hand, the invasiveness of the procedure -which requires surgical denudation (inguinal and/or cervical) and the insertion of surgical cannulas -leads to many relatives refusing scientific autopsies.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of the minimally-invasive MPMCTA approach and to compare its performance to the current reference-standard (the conventional approach). We included consecutively 16 corpses divided in two groups according to the contrast enhancement approach: radiological catheters (n=8), and surgical cannulas (n=8). Corpses were chosen and assigned randomly from our local data. The quality of the imaging procedure was compared according to four items: global vascular opacification, cerebral venous opacification, and lower limbs opacification (arterial and venous). A minimally-invasive approach for scientific autopsies is feasible through a radiological catheter.

This study aimed to examine the differences in the correlations between physical activity and multiple neurocognitive domains in inpatients and outpatients with schizophrenia and obtain suggestions for further study to facilitate this field. Twenty-nine patients with schizophrenia were examined (16 inpatients and 13 outpatients, 56.0 \u00b1 11.4 years of age).

For cSSSIs, there was no significant difference in clinical cure between ceftaroline and vancomycin plus aztreonam (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.97-1.05; I(2) = 0%). No differences were found for overall mortality, serious adverse events, discontinuation due to adverse events, and overall adverse events. Conclusion Ceftaroline is a viable therapeutic alternative for patients with CAP and cSSSIs, yet identified risks of bias and poor external validity preclude it from being recommended as a first-line agent."}

We hypothesized that the bulbospinal neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) are affected by the levels of glucose, insulin, or incretins (glucagon like peptide-1 [GLP-1] or glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide [GIP]) in patients with DM. To investigate whether RVLM neurons are activated by glucose, insulin, GLP-1, or GIP, we examined changes in the membrane potentials of bulbospinal RVLM neurons using whole-cell patch-clamp technique during superfusion with various levels of glucose or these hormones in neonatal Wistar rats. A brainstem - spinal cord preparation was used for the experiments. A low level of glucose stimulated bulbospinal RVLM neurons. During insulin superfusion, almost all the RVLM neurons were depolarized, while during GLP-1 or GIP superfusion, almost all the RVLM neurons were hyperpolarized. Next, histological examinations were performed to examine transporters for glucose and receptors for insulin, GLP-1, and GIP on RVLM neurons. Low - level glucose - depolarized RVLM neurons exhibited the presence of glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3). Meanwhile, insulin - depolarized, GLP-1 - hyperpolarized, and GIP - hyperpolarized RVLM neurons showed each of the respective specific receptor. These results indicate that a low level of glucose stimulates bulbospinal RVLM neurons via specific transporters on these neurons, inducing hypertension. Furthermore, an increase in insulin or a reduction in incretins may also activate the sympathetic nervous system and induce hypertension by activating RVLM neurons via their own receptors."}

Abnormalities in movement patterns can be measured using motion capture techniques, but identifying compensation mechanisms remains challenging. In order to identify compensatory mechanisms in patients with drop foot, this study evaluated a sample of 15 such patients using a computerized gait analysis system, as compared to a group of 15 healthy subjects. Four classes of parameters were distinguished, falling in differing intervals of percentage differences between the groups in the study. The first class comprised two kinematic parameters for which the values of percentage differences in the control group were more than 100% greater than for the patient group. The second class comprised two kinetic parameters falling in the interval of 100-49%. In the third class, in the 49-20% interval the main differences were observed for spatiotemporal parameters, whereas in the 20-4% interval the differences were distributed similarly for kinematic, kinetic and spatiotemporal parameters. These differences in gait pattern between the groups may be related to both primary motor deficits and secondary compensatory mechanisms. Generally, we conclude that drop foot affects the patients ' overall kinematic and kinetic gait parameters, with compensation seen as a chain originating from a change of movement within the ankle joint."}

The purpose of this study was to investigate the antifungal activity of various probiotics against C. albicans and the inhibitory effects of probiotics on Candida biofilm on the denture surface. The spent culture media of various probiotics were investigated the antifungal efficacy against C. albicans. Candida biofilm was formed on a denture base resin and was then treated with Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus casei. Also, the biofilm s of L. rhamnosus and L. casei were formed and were sequentially treated with C. albicans. Colony-forming units of C. albicans on the denture surface were counted after spreading on agar plate. The denture base resin was treated with the spent culture media for 30 days, after which the denture surface roughness was analyzed with an atomic force microscope. L. rhamnosus and L. casei exhibited stronger antifungal activity than other probiotics. The spent culture medium of L. rhamnosus and L. casei exhibited the antifungal activity against blastoconidia and biofilm of C. albicans. L. rhamnosus and L. casei showed the antifungal activity against Candida biofilm, and the biofilm of L. rhamnosus and L. casei inhibited formation of Candida biofilm on denture surface. Neither of the probiotics affected the surface roughness of the denture base resin. L. rhamnosus and L. casei may be the ideal probiotics for the prevention and treatment of denture-related stomatitis."}

Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (7 indicator congeners), chlorinated pesticides hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethanes (DDTs) and flame retardants such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were determined by gas chromatography coupled mass spectrometry (GC/MS). A sampling rate (R) typical of urban sites (4m(3)/day) was used to estimate the atmospheric concentrations of individual compounds. PCB concentrations in the air (pg/m(3)) ranged from ~1-10 (TEM), ~1-40 (STG) and 4-30 (CON). Higher molecular weight PCBs (PCB -153, -180) were detected at industrial sites (in Concepci\u00f3n). The HCHs showed a prevalence of \u03b3-HCH across all sites, indicative of inputs from the use of lindane but a limited use of technical HCHs in Chile. DDTs were detected with a prevalence of p,p'-DDE accounting for ~50% of the total DDTs. PBDE concentrations in air (pg/m(3)) ranged from 1 to 55 (STG), 0.5 to 20 (CON) and from 0.4 to 10 (TEM), and were generally similar to those reported for many other urban areas globally. The pattern of PBDEs was different among the three cities; however, PBDE -209 was dominant at most of the sites. These results represent one of the few assessments of air concentrations of POPs across different urban areas within the same country. These data will support Chilean commitments as a signatory to the Stockholm Convention on POPs and for reporting as a member country of the Group of Latin America and Caribbean Countries (GRULAC) region."}

Animal studies suggest that ketamine attenuates central sensitization and hyperalgesia and thereby reduces postoperative opioid tolerance. We hypothesized that intraoperative ketamine would reduce immediate postoperative opioid consumption compared with placebo in chronic pain patients with opioid dependency undergoing lumbar spinal fusion surgery. Primary outcome was morphine consumption 0 to 24 hours postoperatively. Secondary outcomes were acute pain at rest and during mobilization 2 to 24 hours postoperatively (visual analogue scale), adverse events, and persistent pain 6 months postoperatively. One hundred fifty patients were randomly assigned to intraoperative S-ketamine bolus 0.5 mg/kg and infusion 0.25 mg\u00b7kg\u00b7h or placebo. Postoperatively, patients received their usual opioids, paracetamol and IV patient-controlled analgesia with morphine. In the final analyses, 147 patients were included. Patient-controlled analgesia IV morphine consumption 0 to 24 hours postoperatively was significantly reduced in the ketamine group compared with the placebo group: 79 (47) vs 121 (53) mg IV, mean difference 42 mg (95% confidence interval -59 to -25), P < 0.001. Sedation was significantly reduced in the ketamine group 6 and 24 hours postoperatively. There were no significant differences regarding acute pain, nausea, vomiting, hallucinations, or nightmares. Back pain at 6 months postoperatively compared with preoperative pain was significantly more improved in the ketamine group compared with the placebo group, P = 0.005. In conclusion, intraoperative ketamine significantly reduced morphine consumption 0 to 24 hours after lumbar fusion surgery in opioid - dependent patients. The trend regarding less persistent pain 6 months postoperatively needs further investigation."}

Acrylamide (ACR) has been classified as a neurotoxic agent in animals and humans. Mitochondrial oxidative stress and dysfunction is one of the most probable molecular mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases. Female Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to ACR (50mg/kg i.p. three times a week), AO (6ml/kg,o.p, per day) or together for 30days. The activities of cytosolic enzymes such as xanthine oxidase (XO), glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), mitochondrial oxidative stress, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) enzymes, mitochondrial metabolic function, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) level and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity were assessed in rat brain. Cytosolic and mitochondrial antioxidant enzymes were significantly diminished in the brains of rats treated with ACR compared to those in control. Besides, ACR treatment resulted in a significant reduction in brain ATP level, mitochondrial metabolic function, OXPHOS and TCA enzymes. Administration of AO restored both the cytosolic and mitochondrial oxidative stress by normalizing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) generating enzymes. In addition, improved mitochondrial function primarily enhancing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) generated enzymes activities and ATP level in the mitochondria. The reason for AO's obvious beneficial effects in this study may be due to synergistic effects of its different bioactive compounds which is especially effective on mitochondria. Modulation of the brain mitochondrial functions and antioxidant systems by AO may lead to the development of new mitochondria - targeted antioxidants in the future."}

The objectives of this study were to assess the bioavailability and transfer potential of various TMs present in water and sediments in a reservoir receiving landfill leachates. An active biomonitoring approach was adopted consisting of exposing naive laboratory organisms in cages deployed in the field. Aquatic insects such as Chironomus riparius larvae are good candidates since they represent key organisms in the trophic functioning of aquatic ecosystems. The results show that water, suspended particles, and sediments were significant ly contaminated by various TMs (As, Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn). Their contribution to the transfer of TMs depends, however, on the specific element considered, e.g., Cd in sediments or Pb in both suspended particles and sediments. The internal fate of TMs was investigated according to their fractionation between an insoluble and a cytosolic fraction. This approach revealed different detoxification strategies capable of preventing the induction of deleterious effects at the individual scale. However, the accumulation of several TMs in C. riparius larvae tissues may also represent a significant load potentially transferable to higher trophic levels."}

The present study investigated the effects of binge-like EtOH exposure in adolescent rats on the febrile response that was induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2). Male rats were exposed to EtOH from postnatal days 25 to 38 in a binge-like pattern. Fever was induced by LPS (5 and 50 \u03bcg/kg, intraperitoneally) and evaluated on postnatal days 51 and 63, or by IL-\u03b2 (3 ng) and evaluated on postnatal day 51. Hematological parameters, the status of peritoneal macrophages, and plasma and cerebrospinal IL-1\u03b2 levels were also evaluated on postnatal day 51. EtOH exposure during adolescence did not alter normal body temperature. However, a significant reduction in the febrile response that was induced by LPS at both doses was observed on postnatal day 51. However, no changes in the febrile response were observed on postnatal day 63 in EtOH-exposed animals. The febrile response that was induced by intracerebroventricular IL-1\u03b2 also significantly decreased in animals that received binge-like EtOH exposure during adolescence. Acute oral treatment with EtOH 24 h prior to LPS administration did not alter the febrile response that was induced by LPS. Binge-like EtOH exposure during adolescence did not alter hematological parameters or the number or viability of peritoneal macrophages. Binge-like EtOH exposure did not alter plasma IL-1\u03b2 levels but reduced the cerebrospinal fluid levels of this cytokine. These results suggest that binge-like EtOH exposure during adolescence causes changes in the central nervous system that can impair the febrile response that can be observed after the cessation of EtOH exposure. These changes were reversible and appeared to involve the LPS / IL-1\u03b2 system."}

The charts of children aged 0 to 17 years, consecutively evaluated for sexual victimization, in emergency department and outpatient settings were reviewed. Data extracted included age, sex, type of sexual contact, anogenital findings, previous sexual contact, toxicology results, and sites tested for NG and CT. Of the 1319 patients who were tested, 579 were tested at more than 1 site, and 120 had at least 1 infected site. Chlamydia trachomatis was identified in 104 patients, and NG was found in 33. In bivariate analysis, a positive test was associated with female sex, age older than 11 years, previous sexual contact, acute or healed genital injury, drug/alcohol intoxication, and examination within 72 hours of sexual contact. Fifty-one patients had positive anal tests, and 24 had positive oral tests. More than 75% of patients with positive extragenital tests had additional positive tests or anogenital injury. Most with a positive anal (59%) or oral (77%) test did not report that the assailant's genitals came into contact with that site. Positive tests for NG and CT in patients evaluated for sexual victimization may represent infection from sexual contact, contiguous spread of infection, or the presence of infected assailant secretions. Relying on patient reports of symptoms, or types of sexual contact, to determine need for testing may miss NG and CT infections in patients evaluated for sexual victimization."}

Here, we developed, optimized, and validated the analytical steps preceding PCR to maximize the detection of Clostridium botulinum group III in avian liver. These pre - PCR steps included enrichment incubation of the whole liver (maximum 25 g) at 37\u00b0C for at least 24 h in an anaerobic chamber and DNA extraction using an enzymatic digestion step followed by a DNA purification step. Conditions of sample storage before analysis appear to have a strong effect on the detection of group III C. botulinum strains and our results recommend storage at temperatures below -18\u00b0C. Short-term storage at 5\u00b0C is possible for up to 24 h, but a decrease in sensitivity was observed at 48 h of storage at this temperature. Analysis of whole livers (maximum 25 g) is required and pooling samples before enrichment culturing must be avoided. Pooling is however possible before or after DNA extraction under certain conditions. Whole livers should be 10-fold diluted in enrichment medium and homogenized using a Pulsifier\u00ae blender (Microgen, Surrey, UK) instead of a conventional paddle blender. Spiked liver samples showed a limit of detection of 5 spores /g liver for types C and D and 250 spores /g for type E. Using the method developed here, the analysis of 268 samples from 73 suspected outbreaks showed 100% specificity and 95.35% sensitivity compared with other PCR -based methods considered as reference.

However, the low quality of such images makes it difficult to analyze them and diagnose diseases. The purpose of this study, therefore, is to improve the contrast and quality of liver ultrasound images. In this study, a number of image contrast enhancement algorithms which are based on fuzzy logic were applied to liver ultrasound images - in which the view of kidney is observable - using Matlab2013b to improve the image contrast and quality which has a fuzzy definition; just like image contrast improvement algorithms using a fuzzy intensification operator, contrast improvement algorithms applying fuzzy image histogram hyperbolization, and contrast improvement algorithms by fuzzy IF-THEN rules. With the measurement of Mean Squared Error and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio obtained from different images, fuzzy methods provided better results, and their implementation - compared with histogram equalization method - led both to the improvement of contrast and visual quality of images and to the improvement of liver segmentation algorithms results in images. Comparison of the four algorithms revealed the power of fuzzy logic in improving image contrast compared with traditional image processing algorithms. Moreover, contrast improvement algorithm based on a fuzzy intensification operator was selected as the strongest algorithm considering the measured indicators. This method can also be used in future studies on other ultrasound images for quality improvement and other image processing and analysis applications."}

We also propose a novel antiviral immunomodulatory pathway controlled by interferon-\u03b2 (IFN-\u03b2) and mediated by immune-responsive gene 1 (IRG1) and itaconic acid, its product. Acanthamoeba polyphaga Mimivirus (APMV) was isolated from amoebae in a hospital while investigating a pneumonia outbreak. Mimivirus ubiquity and role as protist pathogens are well understood, and its putative status as a human pathogen has been gaining strength as more evidence is being found. The study of APMV and human cells interaction revealed that the virus is able to evade the IFN system by inhibiting the regulation of interferon -stimulated genes, suggesting that the virus and humans have had host-pathogen interactions. It also has shown that the virus is capable of growing on IFN-\u03b12, but not on IFN-\u03b2 - treated cells, hinting at an exclusive IFN-\u03b2 antiviral pathway. Our hypothesis based on preliminary data and published articles is that IFN-\u03b2 preferentially upregulates IRG1 in human macrophagic cells, which in turn produces itaconic acid. This metabolite links metabolism to antiviral activity by inactivating the virus, in a novel immunomodulatory pathway relevant for APMV infections and probably to other infectious diseases as well."}

Structural aspects of the electrostatic complexes probed at different length scales were investigated as a function of pH by means of different complementary techniques, namely, with dynamic light scattering, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), turbidity measurements, and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Irrespective of the applied techniques, the results consistently displayed that complexation between LF and PPI did occur. In an optimum narrow range of pH 5.0-5.8, a viscous liquid phase of complex coacervate was obtained upon mild centrifugation of the turbid LF - PPI mixture with a maximum Rh, turbidity and the \u03b6-potential being close to zero observed at pH 5.4. In particular, the SAXS data demonstrated that the coacervates were densely assembled with a roughly spherical size distribution exhibiting a maximum extension of \u223c80 nm at pH 5.4. Equally, AFM image analysis showed size distributions containing most frequent cluster sizes around 40-80 nm with spherical to elliptical shapes (axis aspect ratio \u2264 2) as well as less frequent elongated to chainlike structures.

Sixteen adult patients with craniopharyngiomas were eligible for analysis. They were treated with linear accelerator-based FSRT during 1999-2015. In all cases, diagnosis was confirmed by histological analysis. The prescription dose to the tumor was 54 Gy (median, range 48-54) in 1.8 or 2.0 Gy per fraction, and the maximum radiation dose to the optic nerves and chiasm was 54.2 Gy (median, range 48.6-60.0) for the cohort.

This study aimed to investigate the anti-tumor effects of SBE on hepatoma H22 -bearing mice and explore the underlying immunomodulatory function. The hepatoma H22 -bearing mice were treated by SBE for 30 days. The effect of SBE on the proliferation of HepG2 cells in vitro, the growth of transplanted tumor, the cytotoxicity of natural killer (NK) cells in spleen, the amount of CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) Treg cells and Th17 cells in tumor tissue, and the levels of IL-10, TGF-\u03b2, IL-17A, IL-2, and IFN-\u03b3 in serum of the hepatoma H22 -bearing mice was observered. IL-17A was injected to the SBE treated mice from day 9 post H22 inoculation to examine its effect on tumor growth. SBE treatment inhibited the proliferation of HepG2 cells in vitro with a dose-dependent manner and significantly suppressed the tumor growth of hepatoma H22 -bearing mice. Meanwhile, it increased NK cells' cytotoxicity in spleen, down-regulated the amount of CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) Treg cells and Th17 cells in tumor tissue, and decreased IL-10, TGF-\u03b2, and IL-17A levels (P < 0.01) whereas increased IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 levels (P < 0.01) in the serum of hepatoma H22 -bearing mice.

All specimen were evaluated by dedicated uropathologists. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses tested the effect of different histopathological variant on recurrence, cancer-specific mortality (CSM), and overall mortality (OM) after accounting for all available confounders. Of 1,067 patients, 729 (68.3%) harbored pure urothelial BCa while 338 (31.7%) were found to have a variant. Considering uncommon variants, 21 (2.0%) were sarcomatoid, 10 (0.9%) lymphoepitelial, 19 (1.8%) small cell, 109 (10.2%) squamous, 89 (8.3%) micropapillary, 23 (2.2%) glandular, 34 (3.2%) mixed variants, and 33 (3.1%) were found with other types of variants. With a median follow-up of 6.2 years, 343 recurrence, 365 CSM, and 451 OM were recorded, respectively. At multivariable Cox regression analyses, the presence of small cell variant was associated with higher recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.47, P<0.001), CSM (HR = 3.30, P<0.04), and OM (HR = 2.97, P<0.003) as compared with pure urothelial cancer. Conversely, no survival differences were recorded considering other histological variants (all P> 0.1). Our study confirms that histological variant is not an infrequent event at RC specimen.

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of a Japanese version of the short forms of PCS using a contemporary approach called Rasch analysis. A total of 216 patients with musculoskeletal disorders were recruited in this study. Participants completed study measures, which included the pain intensity, the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), and the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK). Furthermore, the four- item (items 3, 6, 8, and 11) and six- item (items 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, and 13) short forms of the Japanese version of PCS were measured. We used Rasch analysis to analyze the psychometric properties of the original, four- item, and six- item short forms of PCS. Rasch analysis showed that both short forms of PCS had acceptable internal consistency, unidimensionality, and no notable DIF and were functional on the category rating scale. However, four- item short form of PCS had two misfit items. Six- item short form of PCS has acceptable psychometric properties and is suitable for use in participants with musculoskeletal pain. Thus, six- item can be used as brief instruments to evaluate pain catastrophizing."}

Babesiosis is now endemic in Northeastern USA and affects people of all ages. Babesia species infect erythrocytes and can be transmitted through blood transfusion. Whole blood and blood products, which are not tested for Babesia, can cause transfusion - transmitted babesiosis (TTB) resulting in severe consequences in the immuno-compromised patients. The purpose of this study was epidemiological evaluation of babesiosis in a tick-infested state. We examined blood samples from 192 patients who visited clinics during the active tick-borne diseases season, using a newly developed qPCR assay that uses the specific molecular beacon probe. Due to the absence of clear symptomology, clinical laboratories did not test 131 samples by IFA, FISH or microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained blood smears. Babesia infection was detected in all age groups by FISH and microscopy; notably patients >40 years of age represented 64% of tested samples and 13% were younger patients. We tested all samples using qPCR and found that 38% were positive for Babesia. Of 28 samples that were positive by FISH, 27 (96%) were also positive by qPCR indicating high congruency between nucleic acid based tests. Interestingly, of 78 asymptomatic samples not tested by FISH, 22 were positive by our qPCR. Direct detection of Babesia relies upon microscopic examination of patient blood smears, which is labor intensive, difficult to scale up, requires specific expertise and is hence, often not performed. In fact, a clinical laboratory examined only 23 of 86 blood samples obtained from two different counties by microscopy. By considering individuals positive for Babesia infection when results from currently available microscopy, FISH or serological tests were positive, we found that our qPCR is highly sensitive (96.2%) and showed a specificity of 70.5% for Babesia. Robust qPCR using specific probes can be highly useful for efficient and appropriate diagnosis of babesiosis in patients in conjunction with conventional diagnostics, or as a stand-alone test, especially for donated blood screening. The use of a nucleic acid amplification test based screening of blood and blood products could prevent TTB."}

However, these studies have largely ignored three enigmatic genera because of scarce DNA source material and limited overlapping phylogenetic data: blood pheasants (Ithaginis), snow partridges (Lerwa), and long-billed partridges (Rhizothera). Thus, phylogenetic positions of these three genera remain uncertain in what is otherwise a well-resolved phylogeny. Previous studies using different data types place Lerwa and Ithaginis in similar positions, but the absence of overlapping data means the relationship between them could not be inferred. Rhizothera was originally described in the genus Perdix (true partridges), although a partial cytochrome b (CYB) sequence suggests it is sister to Pucrasia (koklass pheasant). To identify robust relationships among Ithaginis, Lerwa, Rhizothera, and their phasianid relatives, we used 3692 ultra-conserved element (UCE) loci and complete mitogenomes from 19 species including previously hypothesized relatives of the three focal genera and representatives from all major phasianid clades. We used DNA extracted from historical specimen toepads for species that lacked fresh tissue in museum collections. Maximum likelihood and multispecies coalescent UCE analyses strongly supported Lerwa sister to a large clade which included Ithaginis at its base, and also including turkey, grouse, typical pheasants, tragopans, Pucrasia, and Perdix. Rhizothera was also in this clade, sister to a diverse group comprising Perdix, typical pheasants, Pucrasia, turkey and grouse. Mitogenomic genealogies differed from UCEs topologies, supporting a sister relationship between Ithaginis and Lerwa rather than a grade. The position of Rhizothera using mitogenomes depended on analytical choices. Unpartitioned and codon-based analyses placed Rhizothera sister to a tragopan clade, whereas a partitioned DNA model of the mitogenome was congruent with UCE results. In all mitogenome analyses, Pucrasia was sister to a clade including Perdix and the typical pheasants with high support, in contrast to UCEs and published nuclear intron data. Due to the strong support and consistent topology provided by all UCE analyses, we have identified phylogenetic relationships of these three enigmatic, poorly-studied, phasianid taxa."}

The aim of this study was to investigate whether laser irradiation and melatonin would have synergistic effects on osteoblastic differentiation and mineralization under hypoxic conditions. MC3T3-E1 cells were exposed to 1% oxygen tension for the hypoxia condition. The cells were divided into four groups: G1 - osteoblast differentiation medium only (as the hypoxic condition), G2 - treatment with 50 \u03bcM melatonin only, G3 - laser irradiation (808 nm, 80 mW, GaAlAs diode) only, and G4 - treatment with 50 \u03bcM melatonin and laser irradiation (808 nm, 80 mW, GaAlAs diode). Immunoblotting showed that osterix expression was markedly increased in the melatonin - treated and laser-irradiated cells at 48 and 72 h. In addition, alkaline phosphatase activity significantly increased and continued to rise throughout the experiment. Alizarin Red staining showed markedly increased mineralized nodules as compared with only melatonin - treated or laser-irradiated cells at day 7, which significantly increased by day 14. Moreover, when melatonin - treated cells were laser-irradiated, the differentiation and mineralization of cells were found to involve p38 MAPK and PRKD1 signaling mechanisms. However, the enhanced effects of laser irradiation with melatonin were markedly inhibited when the cells were treated with luzindole, a selective melatonin receptor antagonist. Therefore, we concluded that laser irradiation could promote the effect of melatonin on the differentiation and mineralization of MC3T3-E1 cells under hypoxic conditions, and that this process is mediated through melatonin 1/2 receptors and PKRD / p38 signaling pathways."}

The aim of the study was to evaluate AQP2 as a predictor of renal insufficiency and death in patients with cirrhosis. Urine samples from 199 patients (90 patients without organ failure [Group 1], 58 patients with organ failure excluding renal failure [Group 2], and 51 patients with organ failure including renal failure [Group 3]) from the CANONIC study were analyzed for urine AQP2 and urine osmolality. There was no difference in AQP2 between the three groups. Urine osmolality was significantly lower in patients in Group 3 versus Group 1 and Group 2 (P = 0.0004). No relation was found between AQP2 and glomerular filtration rate or creatinine; however, AQP2 was a significant predictor of the development of renal insufficiency (P = 0.0485). In a univariate analysis, AQP2 was a significant predictor of 14 and 28-day survival, but this was not confirmed in multivariate analysis. Aquaporin-2 was not associated with disease severity or markers of renal function but was a predictor for the development of renal insufficiency and death. Therefore, its future use as marker of renal insufficiency could be promising, but further research is needed before it can be considered a clinical useful tool."}

To estimate the added effect of surgical fusion as compared to decompression surgery alone in symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis patients with spondylolisthesis. The optimal surgical management of lumbar spinal stenosis patients with spondylolisthesis remains controversial. Patients of the LSOS with confirmed DLSS and spondylolisthesis were enrolled in this study. The outcomes of this study were Spinal Stenosis Measure (SSM) symptoms (score range 1-5, best-worst) and function (1-4) over time, measured at baseline, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months follow-up. In order to quantify the effect of fusion surgery as compared to decompression alone and number of decompressed levels, we used mixed effects models and accounted for the repeated observations in main outcomes (SSM symptoms and SSM function) over time. In addition to individual patients ' random effects, we also fitted random slopes for follow-up time points and compared these two approaches with Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) and the chi-squared test. Confounders were adjusted with fixed effects for age, gender, BMI, diabetes, CIRS musculoskeletal disorders and duration of symptoms. One hundred and thirty-one patients undergoing decompression surgery alone (n = 85) or decompression plus fusion surgery (n = 46) were included in this study. In the multiple mixed effects model the adjusted effect of fusion versus decompression alone surgery on SSM symptoms was 0.06 (95% confidence interval, CI: -0.16 to 0.27) and -0.07 (95% CI: -0.25 to 0.10) on SSM function, respectively. Among the patients with degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis and spondylolisthesis our study confirms that in the two groups, decompression alone and decompression plus fusion, patients distinctively benefited from surgical treatment. When adjusted for confounders, fusion surgery was not associated with a more favorable outcome in both SSM scores as compared to decompression alone surgery. 3."}

The measured synergies contained a mix of both normal and abnormal patterns and were remarkably similar to those described in past work. Interestingly, we found that both normal and abnormal synergies were correlated with perilesional high gamma.

Here, a physiologically -motivated depth of anesthesia monitoring algorithm based on autoregressive-moving-average (ARMA) modeling and derivative measures of interest, Cortical State (CS) and Cortical Input (CI), is retrospectively applied in an exploratory manner to the NMDA receptor antagonist N2O, an adjuvant anesthetic gas used in clinical practice. Composite Cortical State (CCS) and Composite Cortical State distance (CCSd), two new modifications of CS, along with CS and CI were evaluated on electroencephalographic (EEG) data of healthy control individuals undergoing N2O inhalation up to equilibrated peak gas concentrations of 20, 40 or 60% N2O / O2. In particular, CCSd has been devised to vary consistently for increasing levels of anesthetic concentration independent of the anesthetic's microscopic mode of action for both N2O and propofol. The strongest effects were observed for the 60% peak gas concentration group. For the 50-60% peak gas levels, individuals showed statistically significant reductions in responsiveness compared to rest, and across the group CS and CCS increased by 39 and 42%, respectively, while CCSd was found to decrease by 398%. On the other hand a clear conclusion regarding the changes in CI could not be reached. These results indicate that, contrary to previous depth of anesthesia monitoring measures, the CS, CCS, and especially CCSd measures derived from frontal EEG are potentially useful for differentiating gas concentration and responsiveness levels in people under N2O. On the other hand, determining the utility of CI in this regard will require larger sample sizes and potentially higher gas concentrations. Future work will assess the sensitivity of CS -based and CI measures to other anesthetics and their utility in a clinical environment."}

We aimed to explore barriers to access and uptake of antiretroviral therapy (ART) among HIV-positive men who have sex with men in Hanoi. During 2015, we conducted qualitative interviews with 35 participants recruited using snowball sampling based on previous research and social networks. Key individual impediments to ART uptake included inadequate preparation for a positive diagnosis and the dual stigmatisation of homosexuality and HIV and its consequences, leading to fear of disclosure of HIV status. Health system barriers included lack of clarity and consistency about how to register for and access ART, failure to protect patient confidentiality and a reticence by providers to discuss sexual identity and same-sex issues. Results suggest fundamental problems in the way HIV testing is currently delivered in Hanoi, including a lack of client-centred counselling, peer support and clear referral pathways. Overcoming these barriers will require educating men who have sex with men about the benefits of routine testing, improving access to quality diagnostic services and building a safe, confidential treatment environment for HIV-positive men to access, receive and remain in care."}

Pull-down assays and surface plasmon resonance studies revealed that Cdc45 - bound RPA complexed with ssDNA in the 8-10 nucleotide binding mode, but dissociated when RPA covered a 30-mer. Real-time analysis of RPA - ssDNA binding demonstrated that Cdc45 catalytically loaded RPA onto ssDNA. This placement reaction required physical contacts of Cdc45 with the RPA70A subdomain. Our results imply that Cdc45 controlled stabilization of the 8- nt RPA binding mode, the subsequent RPA transition into 30-mer mode and facilitated an ordered binding to ssDNA. We propose that a Cdc45 -mediated loading guarantees a seamless deposition of RPA on newly emerging ssDNA at the nascent replication fork."}

The major clinical side effect is cardiotoxicity but the mechanism is largely unknown. On the basis that gene expression is known to be altered in multiple models of heart failure, we examined differential gene expression of iPSC -derived cardiomyocytes treated at day 11 with the ERBB2 targeted monoclonal antibody, trastuzumab for 48 h and the small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor of EGFR and ERBB2. Transcriptome sequencing was performed on four replicates from each group (48 h untreated, 48 h trastuzumab and 48 h lapatinib) and differential gene expression analyses were performed on each treatment group relative to untreated cardiomyocytes. 517 and 1358 genes were differentially expressed, p < 0.05, respectively in cardiomyocytes treated with trastuzumab and lapatinib. Gene ontology analyses revealed in cardiomyocytes treated with trastuzumab, significant down-regulation of genes involved in small molecule metabolism (p = 3.22 \ufffd\u2014 10(-9)) and cholesterol (p = 0.01) and sterol (p = 0.03) processing.

Recently, some investigations imply that simvastatin has the ability of accelerating hematoma absorption. Thus, this study was designed to examine the efficacy of simvastatin for IVH in rats. Intracerebral hemorrhage with ventricular extension was induced in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats after autologous blood injection. Simvastatin or vehicle was administered orally at 1 day after IVH and then daily for 1 week. MRI studies were performed to measure the volumes of intracranial hematoma and lateral ventricle at days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 after IVH. Motor and neurocognitive functions were assessed at days 1 to 7 and 23 to 28, respectively. Iron deposition, iron -related protein expression, ependymal damage, and histology were detected at day 28. Expression of CD36 scavenger receptor (facilitating phagocytosis) was examined at day 3 after IVH using western blotting and immunofluorescence. Simvastatin significantly increased hematoma absorption ratio, reduced ventricular volume, and attenuated neurological dysfunction post- IVH. In addition, less iron accumulation and more cilia survival was observed in the simvastatin group when compared with the control. What's more, higher expression of CD36 was detected around the hematoma after simvastatin administration. Simvastatin significantly enhanced brain hematoma absorption, alleviated hydrocephalus, and improved neurological recovery after experimental IVH, which may in part by upregulating CD36 expression.

Treatment of icaritin in both primary and established (HT-29) CRC cells induced feedback activation of autophagy, evidenced by p62 degradation, Beclin-1 and autophagy-related gene-5 (ATG-5) upregulation, as well as light chain 3B (LC3B)- GFP puncta formation. Pharmacological inhibiting of autophagy dramatically potentiated icaritin - induced CRC cell death and apoptosis. Meanwhile, shRNA -mediated knockdown of Beclin-1 or ATG-5 also sensitized icaritin - induced CRC cell death and apoptosis. Icaritin activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling in CRC cells, functioning as the upstream signaling for autophagy activation. shRNA / siRNA -mediated knockdown of AMPK\u03b11 inhibited icaritin - induced autophagy activation, but exacerbated CRC cell death. On the other hand, the AMPK activator compound 13 (C13) or the autophagy activator MHY1485 attenuated icaritin - induced cytotoxicity.

Its central part has sensory cells with rhabdomeres on 2, 3, or 4 sides, whereas those of the ventral retina have only two rhabdomeres on opposite sides. In addition, the rhabdomeres of the ventral retina are arranged in a specific way: Whereas in the most ventral part they form long tangential rows, those towards the center are detached and are arranged radially. All sensory cells are wrapped by unpigmented pigment cell processes. In agelenid spiders the axons of the sensory cells exit from the middle of the cell body; their fine structure and course through the eye cup is described in detail. In the central part of the retina efferent nerve fibres were found forming synapses along the distal region of the receptor cells. A muscle is attached laterally to each eye cup that allows mainly rotational movements of the eyes.

Inhibiting TCF8 expression with siRNA reversed EMT in podocytes in the presence of a high concentration of glucose and angiotensin.

In this review, we discuss several key host receptors and cognate adhesins that function in bacterial pathogenesis. In particular, we examine the elevated expression of host surface receptors such as CEACAM-1, CEACAM-6, ICAM-1 and PAFR in response to specific stimuli. We explore how upregulated receptors, in turn, expose the host to a range of bacterial infections in the respiratory tract. It is apparent that exploitation of receptor induction for bacterial adherence is not unique to one body system, but is also observed in the central nervous, gastrointestinal and urogenital systems. Prokaryotic pathogens which utilize this mechanism for their infectivity include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis and Escherichia coli. A number of approaches have been used, in both in vitro and in vivo experimental models, to inhibit bacterial attachment to temporally expressed host receptors. Some of these novel strategies may advance future targeted interventions for the prevention and treatment of bacterial disease."}

Enteric neural cells expressing the light-sensitive ion channel, channelrhodopsin, were isolated from the fetal or postnatal mouse bowel and transplanted into the distal colon of 3- to 4- week -old wild-type recipient mice. Intracellular electrophysiological recordings of responses to light stimulation of the transplanted cells were made from colonic smooth muscle cells in recipient mice. Electrical stimulation of endogenous enteric neurons was used as a control. The axons of graft -derived neurons formed a plexus in the circular muscle layer. Selective stimulation of graft -derived cells by light resulted in excitatory and inhibitory junction potentials, the electrical events underlying contraction and relaxation, respectively, in colonic muscle cells. Graft -derived excitatory and inhibitory motor neurons released the same neurotransmitters as endogenous motor neurons - acetylcholine and a combination of adenosine triphosphate and nitric oxide, respectively. Graft -derived neurons also included interneurons that provided synaptic inputs to motor neurons, but the pharmacologic properties of interneurons varied with the age of the donors from which enteric neural cells were obtained. Enteric neural cells transplanted into the bowel give rise to multiple functional types of neurons that integrate and provide a functional innervation of the smooth muscle of the bowel wall. Circuits composed of both motor neurons and interneurons were established, but the age at which cells are isolated influences the neurotransmitter phenotype of interneurons that are generated."}

Heating in general was greater at the lobe when the stent was oriented perpendicularly. Our study represents a new method for ex vivo quantification of stent heating. We have found that heating of stents was well below the Food and Drug Administration standards of 2\u00b0C. Thus, our study paves the way for in vivo testing of rTMS (\u226410 Hz) in the presence of implanted magnetic resonance imaging - compatible stents in animal studies. When planning human safety studies though, geometry, orientation, and location relative to the coil would be important to consider as well."}

The clinical data of 31 patients with chronic subdural hematoma treated by double YL-1 needle double skull drilling and 31 controls treated by traditional drilling and drainage were analyzed retrospectively. In the YL-1 needle group, only 1 patient was with hematoma recurrence, 1 patient was with intracranial pneumocephalus, and the remaining patients who were followed up for 3 months achieved a clinical cure. In the traditional drilling and drainage group, 13 patients were with hematoma recurrence within 3 months after the operation and 7 patients were with postoperative intracranial pneumocephalus. The method of double YL-1 needle is better than the traditional drilling and drainage method for the treatment of chronic subdural hematoma because it reduces the postoperative recurrence rate and complications."}

Therefore, in this study, we investigated the laxative effects of Urd on chronic constipation. The constipation phenotypes and their related mechanisms were investigated in the transverse colons of SD rats with loperamide (Lop)- induced constipation after treatment with 100 mg/kg of Urd. The number, weight and water contents of stools were significantly higher in the Lop + Urd treated group than the Lop + Vehicle treated group, while food intake and water consumption of the same group were maintained at a constant level. The thickness of the mucosa layer, muscle and flat luminal surface, as well as the number of goblet cells, paneth cells and lipid droplets were enhanced in the Lop + Urd treated group. Furthermore, the expression of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors M2 and M3 (mAChR M2 and M3) at the transcriptional and translational level was recovered in the Lop + Urd treated group, while some markers such as G\u03b1 and inositol triphosphate (IP3) in their downstream signaling pathway were completely recovered by Urd treatment. Moreover, the ability for mucin secretion and the expression of membrane water channel (aquaporine 8, AQP8) were increased significantly in the Lop + Urd treated group compared with Lop + Vehicle treated group. Finally, the activity of Urd was confirmed in primary smooth muscle of rat intestine cells (pRISMC) based on G\u03b1 expression and IP3 concentration. The results of the present study provide the first strong evidence that Urd can be considered an important candidate for improving chronic constipation induced by Lop treatment in animal models."}

In Arabidopsis thaliana, light-activated PHYs accumulate in the nucleus, where they regulate downstream signaling components, such as phytochrome interacting factors (PIFs). PIFs are transcription factors that act as repressors of photomorphogenesis; their inhibition by PHYs leads to substantial changes in gene expression. The nuclear function of PHYs, however, has so far been investigated in only a few non-seed plants. Here, we identified putative target genes of PHY signaling in the moss Physcomitrella patens and found light-regulated genes that are putative orthologs of PIF-controlled genes in Arabidopsis. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that an ancestral PIF-like gene was already present in streptophyte algae, i.e., before the water-to-land transition of plants. The PIF homologs in the genome of P. patens resemble Arabidopsis PIFs in their protein domain structure, molecular properties, and physiological effects, albeit with notable differences in the motif-dependent PHY interaction. Our results suggest that P. patens PIFs are involved in PHY signaling. The PHY-PIF signaling node that relays light signals to target genes has been largely conserved during land plant evolution, with evidence of lineage-specific diversification."}

However, in vitro preclinical models are essential tools for both the study of basic cancer biology and the promotion of translational research, including drug discovery and drug target identification. This protocol describes conditional reprogramming (CR), which involves coculture of irradiated mouse fibroblast feeder cells with normal and tumor human epithelial cells in the presence of a Rho kinase inhibitor (Y-27632). CR cells can be used for various applications, including regenerative medicine, drug sensitivity testing, gene expression profiling and xenograft studies. The method requires a pathologist to differentiate healthy tissue from tumor tissue, and basic tissue culture skills. The protocol can be used with cells derived from both fresh and cryopreserved tissue samples. As approximately 1 million cells can be generated in 7 d, the technique is directly applicable to diagnostic and predictive medicine. Moreover, the epithelial cells can be propagated indefinitely in vitro, yet retain the capacity to become fully differentiated when placed into conditions that mimic their natural environment."}

The aim of the study was to examine internal facilitation activities at 10 critical access hospitals in rural Iowa during their implementation of TeamSTEPPS, a patient safety intervention, and to identify characteristics that distinguish different types of facilitation activities. We followed 10 critical access hospitals for 2 years after the onset of implementation, conducting quarterly interviews with key informants. On the basis of the transcripts from the first two quarters, a coding template was developed using inductive analyses. The template was then applied deductively to code all interview transcripts. Using comparative analysis, we examined the characteristics that distinguish between the facilitation types. We identified four types of facilitation activities - Leadership, Buy-in, Customization, and Accountability. Individuals and teams engaged in different types of facilitation activities, both in a planned and an ad hoc manner. These activities targeted at both people and practices and exhibited varying temporal patterns (start and peak time). There are four types of facilitation activities that hospitals engage in while implementing evidence-based practices, offering a parsimonious way to characterize facilitation activities. New theoretical and empirical research opportunities are discussed.

Abnormal acoustic startle response (ASR) has been shown to be associated with PTSD, implicating it as a potential predictor of the development of PTSD -like behavior. Since poor extinction and retention of extinction learning are characteristic of PTSD patients, it is of interest to determine if abnormal ASR is predictive of development of such deficits. To determine whether baseline ASR has utility in predicting the development of PTSD -like behavior, the relationship between baseline ASR and freezing behavior following Pavlovian fear conditioning was examined in a group of adult, male Sprague-Dawley rats. Baseline acoustic startle response (ASR) was assessed preceding exposure to a Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigm where freezing behavior was measured during fear conditioning, extinction training, and extinction testing. Although there was no relationship between baseline ASR and fear memory following conditioning, rats with low baseline ASR had significantly lower magnitude of retention of the extinction memory than rats with high baseline ASR. The results suggest that baseline ASR has value as a predictive index of the development of a PTSD -like phenotype."}

We analyzed the development and recovery of kidney injury after lung transplantation and related AKI to whole-blood tacrolimus trough concentrations and other factors causing kidney injury. We retrospectively studied kidney injury in 186 lung-transplantation patients at the UMC Utrecht between 2001 and 2011. Kidney function and whole-blood tacrolimus trough concentrations were determined from day 1 to 14 and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperative. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), septic shock, and nephrotoxic medications were evaluated as covariates for AKI. We analyzed liver injury and drug-drug interactions. AKI was present in 85 (46%) patients. Tacrolimus concentrations were supra-therapeutic in 135 of 186 patients (73%).

However, its role and underlying mechanisms in zebrafish remain largely unknown. To elucidate the function of akt2 in zebrafish, we generated zebrafish lacking akt2 gene via CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Akt2 - null zebrafish exhibit partial lethality and severe growth deficiency, which is different from those observed in akt2 - null mice. Furthermore, akt2 - null zebrafish display deficiency in fin ray development, but their cartilage is not affected. Similar to observations in akt2 - null mice, akt2 - null zebrafish display impaired glucose homeostasis. However, in contrast to that in akt2 - null mice, insulin level is lower in akt2 - null zebrafish, implicating the symptoms of type I diabetes exhibited in akt2 - null zebrafish. In addition, transcriptome analysis reveals that the genes involved in metabolism and osteogenesis are disturbed in akt2 - null zebrafish. Taken together, these data not only support an important role of akt2 in zebrafish survival, growth, bone development and glucose homeostasis, but also suggest that akt2 has divergent functions between mice and zebrafish, even though they are evolutionarily conserved."}

Granule cells exhibited sparse firing, had a single place field, and showed only modest changes when the mouse was tested in different mazes in the same room. In contrast, mossy cells were more active, had multiple place fields and showed stronger remapping of place fields under the same conditions. Although the granule cell - mossy cell synapse was strong and facilitating, mossy cells rarely \"inherited\" place fields from single granule cells.

Co-crystallisation with a structurally -related ligand, granisetron, reveals an almost identical orientation (pdbid; 2YME). However, there is a >1000-fold difference in the affinity of tropisetron at 5-HT3 versus \u03b17 nACh receptors, and \u03b17 nACh receptors do not bind granisetron. These striking pharmacological differences prompt questions about which receptor the crystal structures most closely represent and whether the ligand orientations are correct.

For 15 of the 23 cysteine substitutions, the effects on tropisetron and granisetron were different. Structure-activity relationships on synthesised derivatives of both ligands were also consistent with different orientations, revealing that contrary to the crystallographic evidence from AChBP, the two ligands adopt different orientations in the 5-HT3 receptor binding site.

Results: The prepared emulsions varied in their consistency from solid rubber-like, over soft elastic, to fluid (watery or oily). With droplet sizes >100 nm, all the emulsions belonged to the common type of macroemulsions. The emulsions of the first generation generally showed broader droplet-size ranges compared with the second generation, especially when less defined components such as petrolatum or waxes were present in the lipophilic fraction of the first generation of emulsions. Some of the prepared emulsions showed a yield point and were Bingham fluids. Tribometric adhesion was tested via probe tack tests. Compared with the \" second generation \" (containing less viscous components), the \" first generation \" emulsions were much more adhesive (31-93 mN), a finding attributable to their highly viscous components, i.e., wax, petrolatum, gelatin and poly(vinyl alcohol). In the second generation emulsions, we attained much lower adhesivenesses, ranging between 1-18 mN. The adhesive performance was drastically reduced in the emulsions that contained albumin as the protein component or that lacked protein. Tribometric shear tests were performed at moderate normal loads. Our measured friction forces (4-93 mN in the first and 0.1-5.8 mN in the second generation emulsions) were comparatively low. Differences in shear performance were related to the chemical composition and emulsion structure. Conclusion: By varying their chemical composition, synthetic heterogeneous adhesive emulsions can be adjusted to have diverse consistencies and are able to mimic certain rheological and tribological properties of natural tarsal insect adhesives."}

Of the 55 patients, bilateral tubal patency was observed in 44 (80.0%), unilateral tubal patency and the other partial occlusion in 7 (12.7%), unilateral partial occlusion and the other complete occlusion in 3 (5.4%), and bilateral complete occlusion in 1 (1.8%). The fimbrial parts were observed in 105 fallopian tubes, among which 101 were seen with the finger-like fimbriae floated and moved in the pelvic cavity, whereas 4 tubes were not because of adhesion to the pelvic cavity (n = 3) or the ovary and intestine (n = 1). More than three visible, quite long, and distributed evenly finger-like projection s were present for the patent fimbrial parts; however, fewer, flat, and not evenly distributed finger-like projection s were present for the adhesive tubes. No serious complications occurred during or after this procedure. Combination of 3D HyCoSy with normal saline injected into the pelvic cavity may be a feasible and safe procedure to assess tubal patency and adhesions of the fimbrial parts."}

If being empathic is important in the context of patient care, it is a quality that is already present in students or is learned by students during their practicum in the company of experienced clinicians. This study aimed to compare self-reported empathy ratings between different groups of medical students and one cohort of nursing students who were either exposed or not exposed to explicit empathy training or learning in clinical settings in the presence of patients. The Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (JSPE) was completed before and after groups of medical and nursing students had been exposed to various extended periods of practicum. Some medical student cohorts undertook brief empathy training, whereas others had no exposure. The nursing student cohort had no formal, explicit empathy training. Irrespective of profession, length of practicum or exposure to specific empathy training, there were no significant differences in the self-reported JSPE scores across the seven different cohorts of students. Empathy is a quality that is already present in students or is learned by students during their practicum DISCUSSION: If empathy is caught rather than taught, then brief efforts to enhance empathy may be futile. To optimise the inherent empathic qualities of aspirant health professionals, explicit consideration should be given to how empathy is influenced by the practicum experience."}

Bacterial resistance is often caused by molecular changes at the bacterial surface, which alter the nature of specific drug-target interactions. Here, we identify a novel mechanism by which drug-target interactions in resistant bacteria can be enhanced. We examined the surface forces generated by four antibiotics; vancomycin, ristomycin, chloroeremomycin and oritavancin against drug-susceptible and drug-resistant targets on a cantilever and demonstrated significant differences in mechanical response when drug-resistant targets are challenged with different antibiotics although no significant differences were observed when using susceptible targets. Remarkably, the binding affinity for oritavancin against drug-resistant targets (70 nM) was found to be 11,000 times stronger than for vancomycin (800 \u03bcM), a powerful antibiotic used as the last resort treatment for streptococcal and staphylococcal bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Using an exactly solvable model, which takes into account the solvent and membrane effects, we demonstrate that drug-target interactions are strengthened by pronounced polyvalent interactions catalyzed by the surface itself. These findings further enhance our understanding of antibiotic mode of action and will enable development of more effective therapies."}

We aimed to investigate whether oral methotrexate increases the efficacy of intra-articular corticosteroid therapy. We did this prospective, open-label, randomised trial at ten hospitals in Italy. Using a concealed computer-generated list, children younger than 18 years with oligoarticular - onset disease were randomly assigned (1:1) to intra-articular corticosteroids alone or in combination with oral methotrexate (15 mg/m(2); maximum 20 mg). Corticosteroids used were triamcinolone hexacetonide (shoulder, elbow, wrist, knee, and tibiotalar joints) or methylprednisolone acetate (ie, subtalar and tarsal joints). We did not mask patients or investigators to treatment assignments. Our primary outcome was the proportion of patients in the intention-to-treat population who had remission of arthritis in all injected joints at 12 months. This trial is registered with European Union Clinical Trials Register, EudraCT number 2008-006741-70. Between July 7, 2009, and March 31, 2013, we screened 226 participants and randomly assigned 102 to intra-articular corticosteroids alone and 105 to intra-articular corticosteroids plus methotrexate. 33 (32%) patients assigned to intra-articular corticosteroids alone and 39 (37%) assigned to intra-articular corticosteroids and methotrexate therapy had remission of arthritis in all injected joints (p=0\u00b748). Adverse events were recorded for 20 (17%) patients who received methotrexate, which led to permanent treatment discontinuation in two patients (one due to increased liver transaminases and one due to gastrointestinal discomfort). No patient had a serious adverse event. Concomitant administration of methotrexate did not augment the effectiveness of intra-articular corticosteroid therapy.

Identification of methylated genes and their relationship to clinical features can contribute to the prognosis and early detection of tumors. In this study, we explored the methylation status of APC and BRCA1 genes and their relationship to clinical factors in breast cancer patients. BRCA1 and APC promoter methylation was examined by methylation - specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA) assay in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) breast tissue from 75 patients. APC promoter methylation was detected in 30.67% breast cancer tissues and BRCA1 was methylated in 9.33% of breast tumors. Methylation of APC was associated with low histological grade (p = 0.006) and methylation of BRCA1 was related with lymph node metastasis (p = 0.017). These findings suggest that the methylation status of APC and BRCA1 can be a predictive marker for early detection and better management of breast cancer patients."}

We measured strain-stiffening of recombinantly produced fibrinogen upon clotting. Factor XIII and molecular heterogeneity alter clot elasticity at the protofibril and fiber level. This highlights the hitherto unknown role of molecular composition in fibrin clot mechanics. Background Fibrin plays a crucial role in haemostasis and wound healing by forming strain-stiffening fibrous networks that reinforce blood clots. The molecular origin of fibrin's strain-stiffening behavior remains poorly understood, primarily because plasma fibrinogen is a complex mixture of heterogeneous molecular variants and is often contaminated by plasma factors that affect clot properties. Objectives and methods To facilitate mechanistic dissection of fibrin nonlinear elasticity, we produced a homogeneous recombinant fibrinogen corresponding to the main variant in human plasma, termed rFib610. We characterized the structure of rFib610 clots using turbidimetry, microscopy and X-ray scattering. We used rheology to measure the strain-stiffening behavior of the clots and determined the fiber properties by modeling the clots as semi-flexible polymer networks. Results We show that addition of FXIII to rFib610 clots causes a dose-dependent stiffness increase at small deformations and renders the strain-stiffening response reversible. We find that \u03b3-chain cross-linking contributes to clot elasticity by changing the force-extension behavior of the protofibrils, whereas \u03b1-chain cross-linking stiffens the fibers, as a consequence of tighter coupling between the constituent protofibrils. Interestingly, rFib610 protofibrils have a 25% larger bending rigidity than plasma -purified fibrin protofibrils and a delayed strain-stiffening, indicating that molecular heterogeneity influences clot mechanics at the protofibril scale. Conclusions Fibrinogen molecular heterogeneity and FXIII affect the mechanical function of fibrin clots by altering the nonlinear viscoelastic properties at the protofibril and fiber scale. This work provides a starting point to investigate the role of molecular heterogeneity of plasma fibrinogen in fibrin clot mechanics and haemostasis."}

Each participant completed two 15-min visual search task sets at each curvature setting. The 600-mm and 1200-mm settings yielded better results than the flat setting in terms of legibility and perceived visual fatigue. Relative to the corresponding centre zone, the outermost zones of the 1200-mm and flat settings showed a decrease of 8%-37% in legibility, whereas those of the flat setting showed an increase of 26%-45% in perceived visual fatigue. Across curvature s, legibility decreased by 2%-8%, whereas perceived visual fatigue increased by 22% during the second task set. The two task sets induced an increase of 102% in the eye complaint score and a decrease of 0.3 Hz in the critical fusion frequency, both of which indicated an increase in visual fatigue. In summary, a curvature of around 600 mm, central display zones, and frequent breaks are recommended to improve legibility and reduce visual fatigue."}

Participants included 40 children (mean age = 12.76 years, SD = 4.01) posttreatment (mean time since diagnosis = 1.99 years, SD = 0.21) for pediatric brain tumor. Parents rated children 's behavioral adjustment and adaptive functioning and provided demographic and developmental histories. Diagnostic and treatment -related information was abstracted from medical records. Ratings of adaptive and behavioral functioning approximately 2 years postdiagnosis were within the average range, although the percentage of children exceeding clinical cutoffs for impairment in adaptive skills exceeded expectation, particularly practical skills. Premorbid behavior problems and tumor size predicted posttreatment adaptive functioning. After accounting for adaptive functioning near diagnosis, premorbid behavior problems predicted declines in adaptive functioning 2 years postdiagnosis. After accounting for adjustment near diagnosis, no variables predicted declines in behavioral adjustment. Children may be vulnerable to reduced adaptive functioning following pediatric brain tumor treatment, especially in practical skills. Assessing prediagnosis functioning and diagnostic and treatment -related variables may improve our ability to predict those at greatest risk, although those factors may be less helpful in identifying children likely to develop behavioral difficulties. Screening of these factors in tertiary care and long-term follow-up settings may improve identification of those at greatest need for support services."}

Cross-sectional analysis of 3330 US adults aged \u226540 years participating in NHANES 2013-2014 with evaluable Vertebral Fracture Assessment (VFA). VFA was graded by semiquantitative measurement. BMD and an osteoporosis questionnaire were collected. Overall spine fracture prevalence was 5.4 % and similar in men and women. Prevalence increased with age from <5 % in those <60 to 11 % in those 70-79 and 18 % in those \u226580 years. Fractures were more common in non-Hispanic whites and in people with lower body mass index and BMD. Among subjects with spine fracture, 26 % met BMD criteria for osteoporosis. Prevalence was higher in subjects who met National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) criteria for spine imaging (14 vs 4.7 %, P < 0.001). Only 8 % of people with a spine fracture diagnosed by VFA had a self-reported fracture, and among those who self-reported a spine fracture, only 21 % were diagnosed with fracture by VFA. Spine fracture prevalence is similar in women and men and increases with age and lower BMD, although most subjects with spine fracture do not meet BMD criteria for osteoporosis. Since most (>90 %) individuals were unaware of their spine fractures, lateral spine imaging is needed to identify these women and men.

Optogenetical protein pairs, CRY2 linked to DNMT3A - CD or TET1 - CD and CIB1 fused to a Transcription Activator-Like Element (TALE) locating an Ascl1 promoter region, were designed for site specific epigenetic editing. A differentially methylated region at the Ascl1 promoter, isolated from murine dorsal root ganglion (hypermethylated) and striated cells (hypomethylated), was targeted with these optogenetic-epigenetic constructs. Optimized blue-light illumination triggered the co-localization of TALE constructs with DNMT3A - CD or TET1 - CD fusion proteins at the targeted site of the Ascl1 promoter. We found that this spatiotemporal association of the fusion proteins selectively alters the methylation state and also regulates gene activity. This proof of concept developed herein holds immense promise for the ability to regulate gene activity via epigenetic modulation with spatiotemporal precision."}

NHS England's policy document, The Five Year Forward View (' 5YFV ') of 2014 placed less emphasis on competition without altering the legislation. We explored how commissioners and providers understand the complex regulatory framework, and how they behave in relation to competition and cooperation. We carried out detailed case studies in four clinical commissioning groups, using interviews and documentary analysis to explore the commissioners ' and providers ' understanding and experience of competition and cooperation. We conducted 42 interviews with senior managers in commissioning organisations and senior managers in NHS and independent provider organisations (acute and community services). Neither commissioners nor providers fully understand the regulatory regime in respect of competition in the NHS, and have not found that the regulatory authorities have provided adequate guidance. Despite the HSCA 2012 promoting competition, commissioners chose mainly to use collaborative strategies to effect major service reconfigurations, which is endorsed as a suitable approach by providers. Nevertheless, commissioners are using competitive tendering in respect of more peripheral services in order to improve quality of care and value for money. Commissioners regard the use of competition and cooperation as appropriate in the NHS currently, although collaborative strategies appear more helpful in respect of large-scale changes.

Study staff also visited 106 roadside stands and collected data on availability and characteristics of antibiotics in the stands. 78% had shared antibiotics in their lifetime, most often with family members. In multivariable analysis, agreement with the belief that it is safe to prematurely stop an antibiotic course (OR: 2.8, CI: 1.3-5.8) and concerns about antibiotic side effects (OR: 2.1, CI: 1.1-4.4) were significantly associated with increased odds of reported antibiotic sharing. Antibiotic sharing was not associated with sociodemographic characteristics or antibiotic knowledge. Antibiotics were widely available in 60% of sampled sari-sari stands, in which 59% of antibiotics were missing expiration dates. Amoxicillin and cephalexin were the most commonly available antibiotics for sale at the stands (60% and 21%, respectively). Antibiotic sharing was common and was associated with misconceptions about proper antibiotic use. Antibiotics were widely available in sari-sari stands, and usually without expiration information.

Immunohistochemical (IHC) determination of Ki-67 score or labelling index, by estimating the fraction of Ki67 positively stained tumour cells, is the most widely practiced method to assess tumour proliferation (Dowsett et al. 2011). Accurate manual counting of these cells (specifically nuclei) due to complex and dense distribution of cells, therefore, becomes critical and presents a major challenge to pathologists. In this paper, we suggest a hybrid clustering algorithm to quantify the proliferative index of breast cancer cells based on automated counting of Ki-67 nuclei. The proposed methodology initially pre-processes the IHC images of Ki-67 stained slides of breast cancer. The RGB images are converted to grey, L*a*b*, HSI, YCbCr, YIQ and XYZ colour space. All the stained cells are then characterized by two stage segmentation process. Fuzzy C-means quantifies all the stained cells as one cluster. The blue channel of the first stage output is given as input to k-means algorithm, which provides separate cluster for Ki-67 positive and negative cells. The count of positive and negative nuclei is used to calculate the F-measure for each colour space. A comparative study of our work with the expert opinion is studied to evaluate the error rate. The positive and negative nuclei detection results for all colour space s are compared with the ground truth for validation and F-measure is calculated. The F-measure for L*a*b* colour space (0.8847) provides the best statistical result as compared to grey, HSI, YCbCr, YIQ and XYZ colour space. Further, a study is carried out to count nuclei manually and automatically from the proposed algorithm with an average error rate of 6.84% which is significant. The study provides an automated count of positive and negative nuclei using L*a*b* colour space and hybrid segmentation technique. Computerized evaluation of proliferation index can aid pathologist in assessing breast cancer severity. The proposed methodology, further, has the potential advantage of saving time and assisting in decision making over the present manual procedure and could evolve as an assistive pathological decision support system."}

Effects of ASA dosage on the metabolic profile have not been fully understood. The purpose of our study is to establish a rapid and reliable method to quantify ASA metabolites in biological matrices, especially for glucuronide metabolites whose standards are not commercially available. Then we applied this method to evaluate the effects of ASA dosage on the metabolic and excretion profile of ASA metabolites in rat urine. Salicylic acid (SA), gentisic acid (GA) and salicyluric acid (SUA) were determined directly by UHPLC-MS / MS, while salicyl phenolic glucuronide (SAPG) and salicyluric acid phenolic glucuronide (SUAPG) were quantified indirectly by measuring the released SA and SUA from SAPG and SUAPG after \u03b2-glucuronidase digestion. SUA and SUAPG were the major metabolites of ASA in rat urine 24 h after ASA administration, which accounted for 50% (SUA) and 26% (SUAPG). When ASA dosage was increased, the contributions dropped to 32% and 18%, respectively. The excretion of other three metabolites (GA, SA and SAPG) however showed remarkable increases by 16%, 6% and 4%, respectively. In addition, SUA and SUAPG were mainly excreted in the time period of 12-24 h, while GA was excreted in the earlier time periods (0-4 h and 4-8 h). SA was mainly excreted in the time period of 0-4 h and 12-24 h. And the excretion of SAPG was equally distributed in the four time periods. We went further to show that the excretion of five metabolites in rat urine was delayed when ASA dosage was increased. In conclusion, we have developed a rapid and sensitive method to determine the five ASA metabolites (SA, GA, SUA, SAPG and SUAPG) in rat urine. We showed that ASA dosage could significantly influence the metabolic and excretion profile of ASA metabolites in rat urine."}

We identified a negative epistatic interaction involving naturally occurring variants in the MLH1 and PMS1 mismatch repair (MMR) genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae We hypothesized that this MMR incompatibility, created through mating between divergent S. cerevisiae, yields mutator progeny that can rapidly but transiently adapt to an environmental stress. Here we analyzed the MLH1 and PMS1 genes across 1010 S. cerevisiae natural isolates spanning a wide range of ecological sources (tree exudates, Drosophila, fruits, and various fermentation and clinical isolates) and geographical sources (Europe, America, Africa, and Asia). We identified one homozygous clinical isolate and 18 heterozygous isolates containing the incompatible MMR genotype. The MLH1 - PMS1 gene combination isolated from the homozygous clinical isolate conferred a mutator phenotype when expressed in the S288c laboratory background. Using a novel reporter to measure mutation rates, we showed that the overall mutation rate in the homozygous incompatible background was similar to that seen in compatible strains, indicating the presence of suppressor mutations in the clinical isolate that lowered its mutation rate. This observation and the identification of 18 heterozygous isolates, which can lead to MMR incompatible genotypes in the offspring, are consistent with an elevated mutation rate rapidly but transiently facilitating adaptation. To avoid long-term fitness costs, the incompatibility is apparently buffered by mating or by acquiring suppressors. These observations highlight effective strategies in eukaryotes to avoid long-term fitness costs associated with elevated mutation rates."}

We developed a consensus target predictor using the random forest framework and calculated the number of predicted miRNA - mRNA interactions in various subsets of miRNAs (serum, non - serum) and mRNAs (immune related, nonimmune related). Immune - related mRNAs were predicted to be targeted by serum miRNA more than other mRNAs. Moreover, serum miRNAs were predicted to target many more immune - related mRNA targets than non - serum miRNAs; however, these two biases in immune - related mRNAs and serum miRNAs appear to be completely independent. Immune - related mRNAs have more miRNA binding sites in general, not just for serum miRNAs; likewise, serum miRNAs target many more mRNAs than non - serum miRNAs overall, regardless of whether they are immune related or not. Nevertheless, these two independent phenomena result in a significantly larger number of predicted serum miRNA - immune mRNA interactions than would be expected by chance."}

Female ICR/CD1 mice (8 weeks old, n = 24) received an obesogenic diet (22% fat for 4 weeks and 60% fat for 14 weeks). After 6 weeks, mice were split in three groups (n = 8/ group): no supplementation, 2-OHOA supplementation (1500 mg kg(-1)) and n-3 PUFA supplementation (EPA + DHA, 3000 mg kg(-1) diet). Eight mice were fed standard diet for the whole duration of the study (control group). At the end of the experiment, the following variables were assessed in spleens: levels of reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione, GSH / GSSG, xanthine oxidase (XO) activity, lipid peroxidation, lymphocyte chemotaxis, natural killer (NK) activity and mitogen (ConA and LPS)-induced lymphocyte proliferation. Obese animals presented higher GSSG levels (P = 0.003), GSSG / GSH ratio (P = 0.013), lipid peroxidation (P = 0.004), XO activity (P = 0.015) and lymphocyte chemotaxis (P < 0.001), and lower NK activity (P = 0.003) and proliferation in response to ConA (P < 0.001) than controls. 2-OHOA reversed totally or partially most of the changes (body weight, fat content, GSSG levels, GSH / GSSG, lipid peroxidation, chemotaxis and proliferation, all P < 0.05), while n-3 PUFA reversed the increase in XO activity (P = 0.032). In conclusion, 2-OHOA, and to a lesser extent n-3 PUFA, could ameliorate the oxidative stress and alteration of leukocyte function in spleen of obese mice. Our findings support a link between obesity and immunosenescence and suggest a potential therapeutic tool for obesity -related immune dysfunction. This article is protected by copyright.

These organisms produce spores containing an outer layer, the exosporium. The exosporium is the site of interactions between the spore and the soil environment and between the spore and the infected host during the initial stages of infection. The composition and assembly process of the exosporium are poorly understood. This is partly due to the extreme stability of the exosporium that has proven to be refractive to existing methods to deconstruct the intact structure into its component parts. Although more than 20 proteins have been identified as exosporium - associated, their abundance, relationship to other proteins and the processes by which they are assembled to create the exosporium are largely unknown. In this issue of Molecular Microbiology, Terry, Jiang, and colleagues in Per Bullough's laboratory show that the ExsY protein is a major structural protein of the exosporium basal layer of B. cereus family spores and that it can self-assemble into complex structures that possess many of the structural features characteristic of the exosporium basal layer. The authors refined a model for exosporium assembly. Their findings may have implications for exosporium formation in other spore forming bacteria, including Clostridium species."}

Male C57BL/6J wildtype mice were subjected to 6-weeks of voluntary wheel running or normal cage activities with or without simvastatin treatment (20 mg/kg/d, n = 7-8 per group). Adaptations in in vivo fatigue resistance were determined by a treadmill running test, and by ankle plantarflexor contractile assessment. The tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, and plantaris muscles were evaluated for exercised -induced mitochondrial adaptations (i.e., biogenesis, function, autophagy). There was no difference in weekly wheel running distance between control and simvastatin - treated mice (P = 0.51). Trained mice had greater treadmill running distance (296%, P<0.001), and ankle plantarflexor contractile fatigue resistance (9%, P<0.05) compared to sedentary mice, independent of simvastatin treatment. At the cellular level, trained mice had greater mitochondrial biogenesis (e.g., ~2-fold greater PGC1\u03b1 expression, P<0.05) and mitochondrial content (e.g., 25% greater citrate synthase activity, P<0.05), independent of simvastatin treatment. Mitochondrial autophagy -related protein contents were greater in trained mice (e.g., 40% greater Bnip3, P<0.05), independent of simvastatin treatment. However, Drp1, a marker of mitochondrial fission, was less in simvastatin treated mice, independent of exercise training, and there was a significant interaction between training and statin treatment (P<0.022) for LC3-II protein content, a marker of autophagy flux. These data indicate that whole body and skeletal muscle adaptations to endurance exercise training are attainable with simvastatin treatment, but simvastatin may have side effects on muscle mitochondrial maintenance via autophagy, which could have long-term implications on muscle health."}

To assess the accuracy of femoral tunnel placement in an MPFL reconstruction cohort and to determine the correlation between tunnel accuracy and a validated disease - specific, patient -reported quality-of-life outcome measure. Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Between June 2008 and February 2014, a total of 206 subjects underwent an MPFL reconstruction. Lateral radiographs were measured to determine the accuracy of the femoral tunnel by measuring the distance from the center of the femoral tunnel to the Sch\u00f6ttle point. Banff Patella Instability Instrument (BPII) scores were collected a mean 24 months postoperatively. A total of 155 (79.5%) subjects had adequate postoperative lateral radiographs and complete BPII scores. The mean duration of follow-up (\u00b1 SD) was 24.4 \u00b1 8.2 months (range, 12-74 months). Measurement from the center of the femoral tunnel to the Sch\u00f6ttle point resulted in 143 (92.3%) tunnel s being categorized as \" good \" or \" ideal .\" There were 8 failures in the cohort, none of which occurred in malpositioned tunnels. The mean distance from the center of the MPFL tunnel to the center of the Sch\u00f6ttle point was 5.9 \u00b1 4.2 mm (range, 0.5-25.9 mm). The mean postoperative BPII score was 65.2 \u00b1 22.5 (range, 9.2-100).

Thumb MCP arthrodesis following traumatic injuries is inadequately described and recent studies have questioned the outcome of this treatment. The purpose of this study was to report outcome and disability following thumb MCP joint arthrodesis in the treatment of chronic instability after traumatic injuries. A retrospective review of 26 patients operated on with MCP joint arthrodesis, median follow-up 42 months (8-104 months). Subjective outcome was assessed using the disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand-questionnaire (DASH). In addition, patient satisfaction, pain, stiffness, and impairment of activities of daily living were assessed on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) followed by a question stating whether they would undergo the same procedure again. Two patients (7.7%) needed re-operation due to nonunion. Four patients (15.4%) needed hardware removal. Median DASH - score was 18 (25-75% range 6-47), with lower DASH score s being better. Score s were significantly worse in gender and age matched individuals (p<0.05). Median VAS for pain was 3.7 (range 0-8). More than 50% of patients reported mild, moderate or severe pain, but all patients reported that they were willing to undergo the same procedure again. Our data suggest, that patients with post-traumatic thumb injuries managed with thumb MCP joint arthrodesis perform worse than gender and age matched individuals.

In these patients, removal of autoantibodies treats the disease and outcomes are closely linked to early intervention. The discovery of these autoantibodies in isolated psychiatric syndromes has raised the possibility that these patients may derive similar benefits from immunotherapy, a potentially transformational approach to the treatment of mental illness. Although open-label case series suggest impressive therapeutic outcomes, the pathological relevance of these autoantibodies outside of canonical presentations is debated. The advent of diagnostic criteria for AE attempts to facilitate its prompt identification but risks prematurely neglecting the potential scientific and clinical significance of isolated syndromes that do not satisfy these criteria. Here, we propose using a syndrome - level taxonomy that has occasional, but not necessary, overlap with AE: synaptic and neuronal autoantibody - associated psychiatric syndromes or \" SNAps \". This will prevent confusion with AE and act heuristically to promote active investigation into this rare example of psychopathology defined on a molecular level. We suggest that this concept would have application in other autoantibody - associated syndromes including seizure, cognitive, and movement disorders, in which similar issues arise. We review putative direct and indirect mechanisms and outline experimentally testable hypotheses that would help to determine prospectively in whom autoantibody detection is relevant, and as important, in whom it is not. We summarize a pragmatic approach to autoantibody testing and management in severe mental illness in order to promptly diagnose AE and advocate a research - orientated experimental medicine paradigm for SNAps, where there is greater equipoise. We conclude that SNAps remains a nascent area of clinical neuroscience with great potential and in ongoing need of psychiatry -led basic and clinical research."}

Remarkably, anucleate platelets express the NF-\u03baB machinery, whose role in platelets remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the contribution of NF-\u03baB in the release of cytokines and serotonin by human platelets, following selective stimulation of TLR2 and protease activated receptor 1 (PAR1), a classical and non-classical pattern-recognition receptor, respectively, able to participate to the innate immune system. We discovered that platelet PAR1 activation drives the process of NF-\u03baB phosphorylation, in contrast to TLR2 activation, which induces a slower phosphorylation process. Conversely, platelet PAR1 and TLR2 activation induces similar ERK1/2, p38, and AKT phosphorylation. Moreover, we found that engagement of platelet TLR2 with its ligand, Pam3CSK4, significantly increases the release of sCD62P, RANTES, and sCD40L; this effect was attenuated by incubating platelets with a blocking anti-TLR2 antibody. This effect appeared selective since no modulation of serotonin secretion was observed following platelet TLR2 activation. Platelet release of sCD62P, RANTES, and sCD40L following TLR2 or PAR1 triggering was abolished in the presence of the NF-\u03baB inhibitor Bay11-7082, while serotonin release following PAR1 activation was significantly decreased. These new findings support the concept that NF-\u03baB is an important player in platelet immunoregulations and functions."}

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from 13 patients with GD without eye manifestations; 10 patients with active GO; and 12 patients with nodular goiter (NG). All the patients from GD, GO, and NG were subclinical hyperthyroid. We analyzed the expression of Treg cell markers (CD4, CD25, CD127(-), Foxp3) on T cells and their ability to respond to IGF-1 stimulation. In patients with GD without GO, we found lowered percentages of CD4(+) Foxp3(+) cells, as compared to nodular goiter 1.77 vs. 5.42% (p=0.0276). Similarly, significantly reduced frequencies of CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(-)Foxp3(+) and CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(-) cells were observed in GD patients as compared to nodular goiter patients with hyperthyreosis, (0.7 vs. 1.48%) (p=0.0071) and (14.5 vs. 37.2%) (p=0.0051), respectively.

Decreased frequencies of peripheral blood CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(-)Foxp3(+) in patients with GD and GO could be an useful marker of autoimmune process and perhaps a possible target for future therapies.

To date, there is no therapy to treat this condition. The amount of residual frataxin critically affects the severity of the disease; thus, attempts to restore physiological frataxin levels are considered therapeutically relevant. Frataxin levels are controlled by the ubiquitin-proteasome system; therefore, inhibition of the frataxin E3 ligase may represent a strategy to achieve an increase in frataxin levels. Here, we report the identification of the RING E3 ligase RNF126 as the enzyme that specifically mediates frataxin ubiquitination and targets it for degradation. RNF126 interacts with frataxin and promotes its ubiquitination in a catalytic activity - dependent manner, both in vivo and in vitro.

Our objective was to examine the effects of a computer-based educational intervention designed for general practitioners (GPs) to promote active aging. The Promoting Active Aging (PRACTA) study consisted of a baseline questionnaire, implementation of an intervention, and a follow-up questionnaire that was administered 1 month after the intervention. A total of 151 primary care facilities (response rate 151/767, 19.7%) and 503 GPs (response rate 503/996, 50.5%) agreed to participate in the baseline assessment. At the follow-up, 393 GPs filled in the questionnaires (response rate, 393/503, 78.1%), but not all of them took part in the intervention. The final study group of 225 GPs participated in 3 study conditions: e-learning (knowledge plus skills modelling, n=42), a pdf article (knowledge only, n=89), and control (no intervention, n=94). We measured the outcome as scores on the Patients Expectations Scale, Communication Scale, Attitude Toward Treatment and Health Scale, and Self-Efficacy Scale. GPs participating in e-learning demonstrated a significant rise in their perception of older patients ' expectations for disease explanation (Wald \u03c7(2)=19.7, P<.001) and in perception of motivational aspect of older patients ' attitude toward treatment and health (Wald \u03c7(2)=8.9, P=.03) in comparison with both the control and pdf article groups. We observed additional between- group differences at the level of statistical trend. GPs participating in the pdf article intervention demonstrated a decline in self-assessed communication, both at the level of global scoring (Wald \u03c7(2)=34.5, P<.001) and at the level of 20 of 26 specific behaviors (all P<.05). Factors moderating the effects of the intervention were the number of patients per GP and the facility's organizational structure. Both methods were suitable, but in different areas and under different conditions. The key benefit of the pdf article intervention was raising doctors ' reflection on limitations in their communication skills, whereas e-learning was more effective in changing their perception of older patients ' proactive attitude, especially among GPs working in privately owned facilities and having a greater number of assigned patients. Although we did not achieve all expected effects of the PRACTA intervention, both its forms seem promising in terms of enhancing the competencies of doctors in communication with and activation of older patients."}

To optimize postoperative opioid dosage and better understand opioid consumption patterns after DRF - ORIF, we conducted a prospective study with the hypothesis that opioid consumption would increase with worsening fracture classification and various patient demographics. All patients who underwent DRF - ORIF were consecutively enrolled over a 6-month period. Information collected included patient demographics, fracture type, anesthesia type, amount and type of opioid prescribed, number of pills taken, reason for stopping, and adverse events. Statistical analysis was performed. Ninety-eight patients (79 female, 19 male) were eligible for the study. Mean age was 58 years. Of the 98 patients, 45 received general anesthesia, and 53 received regional anesthesia with a single-shot peripheral nerve block. Mean opioid consumption (morphine equivalence) over a mean of 4.8 postoperative days (range, 0-16 days) was 58.5 mg (range, 0-280 mg). There were no significant differences in opioid consumption between the general and regional anesthesia groups. Mean opioid consumption for the 3 fracture-type groups (AO/OTA [Arbeitsgemeinschaft f\u00fcr Osteosynthesefragen/Orthopaedic Trauma Association] classification) was 57.7 mg (class A), 60.3 mg (class B), and 62.0 mg (class C). Demographic analysis revealed an inverse relationship between age and opioid use. Similarly, there was a trend toward more opioid consumption among self-pay and Medicaid patients. Opioid consumption after DRF - ORIF was equivalent for general and regional anesthesia. A significant relationship was found between increasing age and decreasing opioid consumption. Worsening fracture classification and self-payment / Medicaid payment trended toward increasing opioid consumption. Mean overall opioid consumption (morphine equivalence) was 58.5 mg, or 14.6 pills of oxycodone/acetaminophen 5/325 mg. Surgeons should take these findings into account when optimizing opioid prescribing after DRF repair."}

Via its numerous collateral branches, the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve innervates a very extensive territory including the posterior surface of the thigh, the infragluteal fold, the skin over the ischial tuberosity, but also the lateral anal region, scrotum or labium majus via its perineal branch. We described the pathophysiological features of cluneal neuralgia, the surgical technique and our preliminary results. We performed a transmuscular approach leading to the fat of the deep gluteal region. Exploration was continued cranially underneath the piriformis, looking for potential entrapments affecting the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve and the sciatic nerve. Nerve decompression on the lateral surface of the ischial tuberosity was then performed. A constant anatomical finding must be highlighted: the presence of a lateral fibrous expansion from the ischium passing behind the nerves and vessels, especially the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve and its perineal branches. In our patients, release of this expansion allowed decompression of the nerve trapped by this expansion. Cluneal neuralgia constitutes a distinct entity of perineal pain, which must be identified and distinguished from pudendal neuralgia. Surgery should be performed via a transgluteal approach. A lateral ischial obstacle must be investigated, in the form of a constant fibrous expansion, which, like a retinaculum, can cause nerve entrapment."}

The process serves as a main route for the elimination of superfluous and damaged cellular constituents, thereby mediating macromolecular and organellar turnover. In addition to maintaining cellular homeostasis, autophagy is involved in various other cellular and developmental processes by degrading specific regulatory proteins, and contributing to the clearance of intracellular pathogens. The physiological roles and pathological involvement of autophagy can be effectively studied in divergent eukaryotic model systems ranging from yeast to mice. Such a tractable animal model applied only recently for autophagy researchis the zebrafish Danio rerio, which also facilitates the analysis of more specific biological processes such as tissue regeneration. In this chapter, we overview the main methods and tools that are used to monitor autophagic structures and to assay autophagic responses in this vertebrate organism. We place emphasis on genetic (functional) approaches applied for exploring novel cellular and developmental roles of the autophagic process."}

All patients aged \u226518 years with at least one recorded body mass index (BMI) measurement between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2012 were included. Information retrieved from the databases included primary care data, medical prescriptions, specialist consultations and hospital discharge records from 2009-2013. Costs associated with these data were also calculated. Data are presented for two time periods (1 year after BMI measurement and study end). Primary -to estimate health resources consumption and the associated economic impact on the Italian NHS. Secondary -the prevalence and characteristics of subjects by BMI category. 20 159 adult subjects with at least one documented BMI measurement. Subjects with BMI \u226530 kg/m(2) were defined as obese. The prevalence of obesity was 22.2% (N=4471) and increased with age. At the 1-year observation period, obese subjects who did not receive treatment for their obesity experienced longer durations of hospitalisation (median length: 5 days vs 3 days), used more prescription drugs (75.0% vs 57.7%), required more specialised outpatient healthcare (mean number: 5.3 vs 4.4) and were associated with greater costs, primarily owing to prescription drugs and hospital admissions (mean annual cost per year per patient: \u20ac460.6 vs \u20ac288.0 for drug prescriptions, \u20ac422.7 vs \u20ac 279.2 for hospitalisations and \u20ac283.2 vs \u20ac251.7 for outpatient care), compared with normal weight subjects. Similar findings were observed for the period up to data cut-off (mean follow-up of 2.7 years). Untreated obesity has a significant economic impact on the Italian healthcare system, highlighting the need to raise awareness and proactively treat obese subjects."}

The individuals were randomly categorized into two groups of 30 members; one receiving two 250-mg tablets of magnesium oxide (MG) daily and the other receiving placebo (PG) for 8 wk. The Beck Depression Inventory-II was conducted and the concentration of serum magnesium was measured. At the end of intervention, 88.5% of the MG and 48.1% of the PG (P = 0.002) had a normal level of magnesium. The mean changes of serum magnesium were significantly different across the two groups. After the intervention, the mean Beck score significantly declined. However, in the MG, this reduction was more significant than in the PG (P = 0.02), so that the mean changes in this group experienced 15.65 \u00b1 8.9 reduction, but in the PG, it declined by 10.40 \u00b1 7.9.

Twenty healthy, young adults completed five conditions: (1) walking at a self - selected speed (spontaneous single-task), (2) seated resting (baseline), (3) performing cognitive task while seated (cognitive single-task), (4) walking while simultaneously performing the cognitive task (dual-task), and (5) single-task walking at a speed that matched the participant's dual-task gait speed (matched single-task). Rate of oxygen consumption (V\u0307O2) was recorded during all conditions. Gait speed and cost of walking (Cw; oxygen consumed per distance traveled) were recorded during all walking conditions. Reaction time and accuracy of responses in the cognitive task were recorded during all cognitive task conditions. Data from the fifth minute of each 5- min condition were analyzed. There was no difference in V\u0307O2 between the dual-task and matched single-task walking conditions. V\u0307O2 in the seated cognitive condition was significantly smaller than both walking conditions, but was not significantly different than zero. Cw was significantly greater during the matched single-task walking condition than during the dual-task walking condition. However, the difference in Cw was so small that it is unlikely to be clinically significant (0.008 mLO2/kg/m, 95% CI 0.002-0.014). Cognitive processing while walking may not increase energy demands of walking in healthy young adults. Maintaining non-preferred gait speed (matched speed) overground continuously for 5 min may require attentional resources, and thereby increase metabolic costs relative to walking at habitual speed."}

Twenty-two groups with 120 fifth- year students were each assigned paper-based problem-based learning and video -based problem-based learning using patient -simulated videos. We compared target achievement rates in questionnaires using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and discussion contents diversity using the Mann-Whitney U test.

Video -based problem-based learning displayed significantly higher achievement rates for imagining authentic patients (p=0.001), incorporating a comprehensive approach including psychosocial aspects (p<0.001), and satisfaction with sessions (p=0.001). No significant differences existed in the discussion contents diversity regarding the International Classification of Primary Care Second Edition codes and chapter types or in the rate of psychological codes.

While most genetic studies focused on some particular Chinese populations based on autosomal or Y-chromosomal genetic markers, the forensic characteristics and phylogenetic analyses of the seventh largest Chinese population (Yi ethnicity) on the X-chromosomal genetic markers are scarce. Here, allele frequencies and forensic statistical parameters for 19 X-chromosomal short tandem repeat loci (DXS7424-DXS101, DXS6789-DXS6809, DXS7423-DXS10134, DXS10103-HPRTB-DXS10101, DXS10159-DXS10162-DXS10164, DXS10148-DXS10135-DXS8378, and DXS7132-DXS10079-DXS10074-DXS10075) of 331 Chinese Yi individuals were obtained. All 19 X-chromosomal short tandem repeat (STR) loci in females were consistent with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test. A total of 214 alleles were identified with the corresponding allele frequencies spanned from 0.0019 to 0.6106.

The Snf5/SMARCB1/INI1 subunit of SWI/SNF is a tumor suppressor frequently lost in pediatric rhabdoid cancers. We examined the effects of Snf5 loss on the composition, nucleosome binding, recruitment, and remodeling activities of yeast SWI/SNF. The Snf5 subunit is shown by crosslinking-mass spectrometry (CX-MS) and subunit deletion analysis to interact with the ATPase domain of Snf2 and to form a submodule consisting of Snf5, Swp82, and Taf14. Snf5 promotes binding of the Snf2 ATPase domain to nucleosomal DNA and enhances the catalytic and nucleosome remodeling activities of SWI/SNF. Snf5 is also required for SWI/SNF recruitment by acidic transcription factors. RNA-seq analysis suggests that both the recruitment and remodeling functions of Snf5 are required in vivo for SWI/SNF regulation of gene expression. Thus, loss of SNF5 alters the structure and function of SWI/SNF."}

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) has demonstrated evidence of changes in metabolic patterns in individuals with PD. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the presence of PD could be \" predicted \" based on resting fluctuations in the blood oxygenation level dependent signal. We utilized RS-fMRI to measure the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and the fractional ALFF (fALFF) in 51 patients with PD and 50 age - and sex -matched healthy controls. Compared with the healthy controls, the individuals with PD exhibited altered ALFFs in the bilateral lingual gyrus and left putamen and an altered fALFF in the right cerebellum posterior lobe. Support vector machines (SVMs), which comprise a supervised pattern recognition method that enables predictions at the individual level, were trained to separate individuals with PD from healthy controls based on the ALFF and fALFF. Using the leave-one-out cross-validation method to analyze our sample, we reliably distinguished the participants with PD from the controls with 92% sensitivity and 87% specificity. Overall, these findings suggest that the SVM - neuroimaging approach may be of particular clinical value because it enables the accurate identification of PD at the individual level.

Post - fertilization demethylation of paternal and maternal genomes is considered to occur by an active and passive mechanism respectively, in most mammals but sheep; in this species no loss of methylation was observed in either pronucleus. Post - fertilization reprogramming relies on methylating and demethylating enzymes and co-factors that are stored during oocyte growth, concurrently with the re-methylation of the oocyte itself. The crucial remodelling of the oocyte epigenetic baggage often overlaps with potential interfering events such as exposure to assisted reproduction technologies or environmental changes. Here, we report a temporal analysis of methylation dynamics during folliculogenesis and early embryo development in sheep. We characterized global DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation by immunofluorescence and relatively quantified the expression of the enzymes and co-factors mainly responsible for their remodelling (DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins and methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) proteins). Our results illustrate for the first time the patterns of hydroxymethylation during oocyte growth. We observed different patterns of methylation and hydroxymethylation between the two parental pronuclei, suggesting that male pronucleus undergoes active demethylation also in sheep. Finally, we describe gene -specific accumulation dynamics for methylating and demethylating enzymes during oocyte growth and observe patterns of expression associated with developmental competence in a differential model of oocyte potential. Our work contributes to the understanding of the methylation dynamics during folliculogenesis and early embryo development and improves the overall picture of early rearrangements that will originate the embryo epigenome."}

Since then, the disease has spread rapidly through Italy's main olive oil producing region. The epidemiology of the outbreak is largely unstudied, with the list of X. fastidiosa hosts and vectors in Europe likely incomplete, and the role humans play in dispersal unknown. These knowledge gaps have led to management strategies based on general assumptions that require, among others, local vector control and, in certain areas, the destruction of infected plants and healthy ones around them in an attempt to eradicate or halt the spreading pest. Here we show that, regardless of epidemiological uncertainties, the mere distribution of olive orchards in Southern Italy makes the chances of eradicating X. fastidiosa from the region extremely slim. Our results imply that Southern Italy is becoming a reservoir for X. fastidiosa. As a consequence, management strategies should keep the prevalence of X. fastidiosa in the region as low as possible, primarily through vector control, lest the pathogen, that has also been detected in southern France and the island of Mallorca (Spain), continues spreading through Italy and Europe."}

The performance in plaque detection has not been compared between the modalities. The aim of the current study was to compare the performance of MRI and ultrasound in detecting carotid artery plaques and measuring extent of atherosclerosis. Subjects with at least one plaque (height \u22652\u00b75 mm) on ultrasound were imaged using MRI. The number of plaques and their height was measured in both modalities; plaque area and volume were analysed on ultrasound and MRI, respectively. Thirty-eight subjects were included. MRI detected plaques in 95% of carotid arteries with a plaque height of \u22652\u00b75 mm on ultrasound and in all carotid arteries with a plaque exceeding 2\u00b75 mm. MRI detected 53% of the plaques with a height below 2\u00b75 mm. The plaque height measured with both techniques correlated significantly, 0\u00b759, P<0\u00b70001. Ultrasound -derived plaque height and plaque area correlated similarly to MRI -derived plaque volume, r = 0\u00b752; P<0\u00b70001 and r = 0\u00b747; P = 0\u00b7001, respectively. We conclude that MRI has a similar sensitivity to ultrasound in finding carotid artery plaques that are 2\u00b75 mm or higher. In smaller plaques, MRI detects fewer plaques. Multiple carotid plaques seen on ultrasound most often are a misinterpretation of the anatomy and correspond to a single plaque. Plaque height on ultrasound is comparable to plaque height on MRI and correlates fairly well with plaque volume on MRI making it an interesting proxy for plaque burden."}

Monitoring colony recovery from bleaching disturbances over multiyear time frames is important for improving predictions of future coral community changes. However, there are currently few multiyear studies describing long-term outcomes for coral colonies following acute bleaching events. We recorded colony pigmentation and size for bleached and unbleached groups of co-located conspecifics of three major reef-building scleractinian corals (Orbicella franksi, Siderastrea siderea, and Stephanocoenia michelini; n = 198 total) in Bocas del Toro, Panama, during the major 2005 bleaching event and then monitored pigmentation status and changes live tissue colony size for 8 years (2005-2013). Corals that were bleached in 2005 demonstrated markedly different response trajectories compared to unbleached colony groups, with extensive live tissue loss for bleached corals of all species following bleaching, with mean live tissue losses per colony 9 months postbleaching of 26.2% (\u00b15.4 SE) for O. franksi, 35.7% (\u00b14.7 SE) for S. michelini, and 11.2% (\u00b13.9 SE) for S. siderea.

Following this event, all species again lost tissue, with previously unbleached colony species groups experiencing greater declines than conspecific sample groups, which were previously bleached, indicating a possible positive acclimative response. However, despite this beneficial effect for previously bleached corals, all groups experienced substantial net tissue loss between 2005 and 2013, indicating that many important Caribbean reef-building corals will likely suffer continued tissue loss and may be unable to maintain current benthic coverage when faced with future thermal stress forecast for the region, even with potential benefits from bleaching -related acclimation."}

The backing layer consists of Ethocel\u2122 Standard 10 Premium and the mucoadhesive layer was prepared using a mixture of Methocel\u2122 E15 Premium LV, polyvinyl alcohol and Macrogol 400. The wafers were characterized regarding their appearance, mechanical properties and dissolution profiles as well as the influence of backing layer thickness on drug transfer and their ability of unidirectional drug release. The wafers with backing layer thickness of 500\u03bcg Ethocel \u2122/cm(2) presented adequate mechanical properties, a drug transfer about 73% and unidirectional drug release."}

The Cambodian Government aims to eliminate all forms of malaria by 2025. The country's malaria incidence is highly variable at provincial level, but less is known at village level. This study used passive case detection (PCD) data at village level in Ratanakiri Province from 2010 to 2014 to describe incidence trends and identify high-risk areas of malaria to be primarily targeted towards malaria elimination. In 2010, the Cambodian malaria programme created a Malaria Information System (MIS) to capture malaria information at village level through PCD by village malaria workers and health facilities. The MIS data of Ratanakiri Province 2010-2014 were used to calculate annual incidence rates by Plasmodium species at province and commune levels. For estimating the trend at provincial level only villages reporting each year were selected. The communal incidences and the number of cases per village were visualized on a map per Plasmodium species and per year. Analysis of spatial clustering of village malaria cases by Plasmodium species was performed by year. Overall, malaria annual incidence rates per 1000 inhabitants decreased from 86 (2010) to 30 (2014). Falciparum incidence decreased (by 79% in 2014 compared to 2010; CI 95% 76-82%) more rapidly than vivax incidence (by 19% in 2014 compared to 2010; CI 95% 5-32%). There were ten to 16 significant spatial clusters each year. Big clusters tended to extend along the Cambodian-Vietnamese border and along the Sesan River. Three clusters appeared throughout all years (2010-2014): one with 21 villages appeared each year, the second shrunk progressively from 2012 to 2014 and the third was split into two smaller clusters in 2013 and 2014. The decline of malaria burden can be attributed to intensive malaria control activities implemented in the areas: distribution of a long-lasting insecticidal net per person and early diagnosis and prompt treatment. Dihydro-artemisinin piperaquine was the only first-line treatment for all malaria cases. No radical treatment with primaquine was provided for Plasmodium vivax cases, which could explain the slow decrease of P. vivax due to relapses. To achieve malaria elimination by 2025, priority should be given to the control of stable malaria clusters appearing over time."}

Both diseases can lead to nutritional compromise and negative impacts upon self-esteem and quality of life. As complex chronic diseases, they share common risk factors, such as a requirement for a pathogenic plaque biofilm, yet they exhibit distinct pathophysiologies. Multiple exposures contribute to their causal pathways, and susceptibility involves risk factors that are inherited (e.g. genetic variants), and those that are acquired (e.g. socio-economic factors, biofilm load or composition, smoking, carbohydrate intake). Identification of these factors is crucial in the prevention of both diseases as well as in their management. To systematically appraise the scientific literature to identify potential risk factors for caries and periodontal diseases. One systematic review (genetic risk factors), one narrative review (role of diet and nutrition) and reference documentation for modifiable acquired risk factors common to both disease groups, formed the basis of the report. There is moderately strong evidence for a genetic contribution to periodontal diseases and caries susceptibility, with an attributable risk estimated to be up to 50%. The genetics literature for periodontal disease is more substantial than for caries and genes associated with chronic periodontitis are the vitamin D receptor (VDR), Fc gamma receptor IIA (Fc-\u03b3RIIA) and Interleukin 10 (IL10) genes. For caries, genes involved in enamel formation (AMELX, AMBN, ENAM, TUFT, MMP20, and KLK4), salivary characteristics (AQP5), immune regulation and dietary preferences had the largest impact. No common genetic variants were found. Fermentable carbohydrates (sugars and starches) were the most relevant common dietary risk factor for both diseases, but associated mechanisms differed. In caries, the fermentation process leads to acid production and the generation of biofilm components such as Glucans. In periodontitis, glycaemia drives oxidative stress and advanced glycation end-products may also trigger a hyper inflammatory state. Micronutrient deficiencies, such as for vitamin C, vitamin D or vitamin B12, may be related to the onset and progression of both diseases. Functional foods or probiotics could be helpful in caries prevention and periodontal disease management, although evidence is limited and biological mechanisms not fully elucidated. Hyposalivation, rheumatoid arthritis, smoking/tobacco use, undiagnosed or sub-optimally controlled diabetes and obesity are common acquired risk factors for both caries and periodontal diseases."}

Injectable insulin has been typically utilized for the management of this chronic disease. However, lack of patient compliance with injectable formulations has spurred the development of oral insulin formulations, which although appealing, face several delivery challenges. We have developed novel mucoadhesive intestinal patches, several hundred micrometers in dimension (micropatches) that address the challenges of oral insulin delivery. The micropatches adhere to the intestinal mucosa, release their drug load rapidly within 30 min and are effective in lowering blood glucose levels in vivo. When insulin -loaded micropatches were administered with a permeation enhancer and protease inhibitor, a peak efficacy of 34% drop in blood glucose levels was observed within 3 h. Efficacy further improved to 41% when micropatches were administered in multiple doses. Here, we describe the design of micropatches as an oral insulin formulation and report their in vivo efficacy."}

Modern learning theory and cognitive and emotional processing theories highlight the importance of reducing avoidance, facilitating the constructive processing of feared experiences, and strengthening new inhibitory learning. We examined variables thought to be associated with unproductive and constructive processing of traumatic experiences in a sample of 81 youth with elevated PTSD symptoms, who received Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) for abuse or traumatic interpersonal loss. Sessions during the trauma narrative phase of TF-CBT were coded for indicators of unproductive processing (overgeneralization, rumination, avoidance) and constructive processing (decentering, accommodation of corrective information), as well as levels of negative emotion. In previous analyses of this trial (Ready et al., 2015), more overgeneralization during the narrative phase predicted less improvement in internalizing symptoms at posttreatment and a worsening of externalizing symptoms over the 12-month follow-up. In contrast, more accommodation predicted improvement in internalizing symptoms and also moderated the negative effects of overgeneralization on internalizing and externalizing symptoms. The current study examined correlates of overgeneralization and accommodation. Overgeneralization was associated with more rumination, less decentering, and more negative emotion, suggesting immersion in trauma -related material. Accommodation was associated with less avoidance and more decentering, suggesting a healthy distance from trauma -related material that might allow for processing and cognitive change. Decentering also predicted improvement in externalizing symptoms at posttreatment. Rumination and avoidance showed important associations with overgeneralization and accommodation, respectively, but did not predict treatment outcomes. This study identifies correlates of overgeneralization and accommodation that might shed light on how these variables relate to unproductive and constructive processing of traumatic experiences."}

We aimed to investigate effects of obesity on IL-33 / ST2 system in heart, adipose tissue and liver in a rodent model of obesity. The relationship of cardiac expression of IL-33 / ST2 system with natriuretic peptides (NPs) system and inflammatory mediators was also studied. mRNA expression of IL-33 / ST2 system was evaluated in cardiac, adipose and hepatic biopsies from obese Zucker rats (O) and controls (CO). Expression levels of sST2 was significantly lower in O rats compared with CO (p<0.05) in all tissues. Besides, the mRNA levels of IL-33 decreased significant in fat of O respect to CO, while, expression levels of ST2L was significantly higher in liver of CO than in O. A strong relationship of IL-33 / ST2 with NPs and classical inflammatory mediators was observed in cardiac tissue. Expression of sST2 in cardiac, adipose and liver tissue decreased in O compared with controls, suggesting an involvement for IL-33 / ST2 system in molecular mechanisms of obesity.

We evaluated the CXCR4 (CD184) expression in the harvest cells and in the post-transplant bone marrow (BM) and its relation to engraftment, as determined by the consensus criteria and chimerism. This is a prospective study which included 30 patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; 15 patients received autograft and 15 patients received allograft on dates between January 2012 and May 2014. We assessed CD184 (CXCR4) using flow cytometry in the harvest cells together with post-transplant BM assessment on Day 28 and Day 90 for complete morphologic, molecular studies, and detection of CD184 expression on CD34(+) cells with chimerism studies on total peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Diagnoses of the enrolled patients were as follows: seven (24.1%) with acute myeloid leukemia, eight (27.6%) with multiple myeloma, four (13.8%) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, three (10.3%) with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, two (6.9%) with myelodysplastic syndromes, two (6.9%) with aplastic anemia, two (6.9%) with chronic myeloid leukemia, one (3.4%) with Hodgkin lymphoma, and one (3.4%) with plasmacytomas. One patient died and was excluded from the study because there were not enough data about engraftment. There was no statistical significance between the level of CD184 in stem cell harvest and the prediction of successful engraftment (p>0.05) as well as in Day 28 BM sample (p>0.05), whereas there was a statistical significance between the level of CD184 in Day 90 BM sample and the occurrence of successful engraftment (p=0.002). SDF-1 / CXCR4 axis plays a crucial role in engraftment; however, more studies are warranted to assess their expression post-transplant.

Fifty-three haplotypes were identified from 98 sequences. Phylogenetic tree and haplotype network analyses revealed that global isolates of T. saginata were genetically divided into five groups (A, B, C1, C2 and D). Taenia saginata isolates from Lao PDR and northeastern Thailand belonged to either Group A or B. Taenia saginata from western Thailand clustered in groups C1, C2 and D, and populations from the northeast and western Thailand were found to be genetically distinct.

The lack of hormone receptors limits the treatment options available to patients with this diagnosis, forcing them to endure prolonged radiation and chemotherapy. Anti-angiogenesis is a chemotherapeutic strategy that targets the vasculature of tumors. Combretastatin A-4 (CA-4) is a well-known vasculature - disrupting agent, which has been shown to effectively kill a variety of cancers through inhibition of tubulin polymerization.

We have designed a novel dual action CA-4 prodrug, YK-5-252, which releases the drug through a disulfide bond cleavage mechanism and contains a near-infrared (NIR) fluorophore, which allows fluorescence monitoring of cleavage. This disulfide linkage causes CA-4 to become effective only when released by glutathione (GSH) reducing the toxicity of the drug while simultaneously releasing the NIR fluorophore. Therefore the prodrug, YK-5-252, represents a novel CA-4 analogue which has reduced toxicity and can be used for theranostics imaging."}

Described many decades ago, recent epidemiological studies reveal its important spread within Europe in the last years. To date, many epidemiological aspects related to life cycle, routes of transmission, incidence rates and associated risk factors are lacking; hence, the establishment of appropriate disease control programmes poses an important challenge. Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine the epidemiological pattern of the disease in an endemic herd reared under extensive conditions (Spanish Pyrenees) by identifying main factors associated with infection and clinical disease dynamics. The study population consisted of 276 Brown Swiss and Pirenaica adult animals and 145 calves born and weaned at the farm during the study. Three sampling time frames were used: January 2010, September 2010 and February 2011, which allowed us to differentiate two periods designated as mountain and valley periods. The data related to animals (breed, sex and age) and herd management (animal grouping and time in housing) were recorded. The data collection methodology was mainly based on clinical examinations and defining the serological status against bovine besnoitiosis by the immunofluorescent antibody testing of blood samples. The total prevalence among adult animals was 38.34% (CI 95%: 34.53-42.07), with 18.54% of seropositive animals showing clinical signs. In regard to the cumulative incidence, 34.57% of new infections were detected during the mountain period, in contrast to the 24.59% observed in the valley period. The incidence density was 0.058 and 0.061 new infections per animal - month for the mountain and valley periods, respectively. According to the seroepidemiological study, the seroconversion probability of B. besnoiti infection was directly associated with the number of seropositive cows with whom an animal had been stabled as well as the housing period duration, supporting horizontal transmission by close contact as one of the most important methods of disease spread. In addition, the risk of developing the clinical course increased with age, and the presence of clinical signs was related to higher antibody responses. Among calves (from 3.1 to 7.1 months old) sampled once at weaning, the total seroprevalence was 15.17% (CI 95%: 9.36-21.04), and the chronic stage was observed in three animals, supporting the ability of B. besnoiti to infect and even cause disease in animals less than 6 months old. Finally, the risk of calf seroconversion was positively related to the serological status of the cows, suggesting postnatal transmission between dams and offspring by contact during the suckling period."}

The dimensionality of the data as well as complex relationships between microbiota and host genomics pose considerable challenges for analysis. In this article, we apply a kernel RV coefficient (KRV) test to evaluate the overall association between host gene expression and microbiome composition. The KRV statistic can capture nonlinear correlations and complex relationships among the individual data types and between gene expression and microbiome composition through measuring general dependency. Testing proceeds via a similar route as existing tests of the generalized RV coefficients and allows for rapid p-value calculation. Strategies to allow adjustment for confounding effects, which is crucial for avoiding misleading results, and to alleviate the problem of selecting the most favorable kernel are considered. Simulation studies show that KRV is useful in testing statistical independence with finite samples given the kernels are appropriately chosen, and can powerfully identify existing associations between microbiome composition and host genomic data while protecting type I error. We apply the KRV to a microbiome study examining the relationship between host transcriptome and microbiome composition within the context of inflammatory bowel disease and are able to derive new biological insights and provide formal inference on prior qualitative observations."}

The samples were taken from porcine bone subjected to shallow burial and surface depositions at 28- day intervals for a period of 140 days. Results indicated that ICP-OES elemental profiling has potential to be developed as a forensic test for determining whether a bone sample originates from the early stages of soft tissue putrefaction. Significant changes in iron, sodium and potassium concentrations were found over 140 days. These elements are known to be primarily associated with proteins and/or tissue fluids within the bone. Changes in their respective concentrations may therefore be linked to dehydration over time and in turn may be indicative of time since deposition."}

Under such circumstances, the extinct donor of a genome found in the polyploid may be treated as a 'ghost' species in that its prior existence is recognized through the presence of its genome in the polyploid. In this study, we aimed to determine the polyploid origin of Oxyria sinensis (2n = 40) for which only one congeneric species is known, that is diploid O. digyna (2n = 14). Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), transcriptome, phylogenetic and demographic analyses, and ecological niche modelling were conducted for this purpose. GISH revealed that O. sinensis comprised 14 chromosomes from O. digyna and 26 chromosomes from an unknown ancestor. Transcriptome analysis indicated that following divergence from O. digyna, involving genome duplication around 12 million years ago (Ma), a second genome duplication occurred approximately 6 Ma to give rise to O. sinensis. Oxyria sinensis was shown to contain homologous gene sequences divergent from those present in O. digyna in addition to a set that clustered with those in O. digyna. Coalescent simulations indicated that O. sinensis expanded its distribution approximately 6-7 Ma, possibly following the second polyploidization event, whereas O. digyna expanded its range much later. It was also indicated that the distributions of both species contracted and re-expanded during the Pleistocene climatic oscillations. Ecological niche modelling similarly suggested that both species experienced changes in their distributional ranges in response to Quaternary climatic changes. The extinction of the unknown 'ghost' tetraploid species implicated in the origin of O. sinensis could have resulted from superior adaptation of O. sinensis to repeated climatic changes in the region where it now occurs."}

The clinical, histologic, and immunophenotypic features as well as EWSR1 rearrangement status of 19 gynecologic PNETs, including 10 ovarian, 8 uterine, and 1 vulvar tumors, are herein reported. Patient age ranged from 12 to 68 years, with a median age of 20 and 51 years among those with ovarian and uterine PNETs, respectively. Morphologic features of central nervous system (CNS) tumors were seen in 15 PNETs, including 9 medulloblastomas, 3 ependymomas, 2 medulloepitheliomas, and 1 glioblastoma, consistent with central PNET. The remaining 4 PNETs were composed entirely of undifferentiated small round blue cells and were classified as Ewing sarcoma/peripheral PNET. Eight PNETs were associated with another tumor type, including 5 ovarian mature cystic teratomas, 2 endometrial low-grade endometrioid carcinomas, and a uterine carcinosarcoma. By immunohistochemistry, 17 PNETs expressed at least 1 marker of neuronal differentiation, including synaptophysin, NSE, CD56, S100, and chromogranin in 10, 8, 14, 8, and 1 tumors, respectively. GFAP was positive in 4 PNETs, all of which were of central type. Membranous CD99 and nuclear Fli-1 staining was seen in 10 and 16 tumors, respectively, and concurrent expression of both markers was seen in both central and Ewing sarcoma/peripheral PNET s. All tumors expressed vimentin, whereas keratin cocktail (CAM5.2, AE1/AE3) staining was only focally present in 4 PNETs. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was successful in all cases and confirmed EWSR1 rearrangement in 2 of 4 tumors demonstrating morphologic features of Ewing sarcoma/peripheral PNET and concurrent CD99 and Fli-1 expression. In conclusion, central and Ewing sarcoma/peripheral PNETs may be encountered in the female genital tract with central PNETs being more common. Central PNETs show a spectrum of morphologic features that overlaps with CNS tumors but lack EWSR1 rearrangement s. GFAP expression supports a morphologic impression of central PNET and is absent in Ewing sarcoma/peripheral PNET. Ewing sarcoma/peripheral PNETs lack morphologic features of CNS tumors."}

Interestingly, the incidence of HO significantly increases with repeated operations and after resection of previous HO. Treatment of established heterotopic ossification is challenging because surgical excision is often incomplete, with evidence of persistent heterotopic bone. As a result, patients may continue to report the signs or symptoms of HO, including chronic pain, nonhealing wounds, and joint restriction. In this study, we designed a model of recurrent HO that occurs after surgical excision of mature HO in a mouse model of hind-limb Achilles' tendon transection with dorsal burn injury. We first demonstrated that key signaling mediators of HO, including bone morphogenetic protein signaling, are diminished in mature bone. However, upon surgical excision, we have noted upregulation of downstream mediators of osteogenic differentiation, including pSMAD 1 / 5. Additionally, surgical excision resulted in re-emergence of a mesenchymal cell population marked by expression of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-\u03b1 (PDGFR\u03b1) and present in the initial developing HO lesion but absent in mature HO. In the recurrent lesion, these PDGFR\u03b1 + mesenchymal cells are also highly proliferative, similar to the initial developing HO lesion. These findings indicate that surgical excision of HO results in recurrence through similar mesenchymal cell populations and signaling mechanisms that are present in the initial developing HO lesion. These results are consistent with findings in patients that new foci of ectopic bone can develop in excision sites and are likely related to de novo formation rather than extension of unresected bone.

Adding buffer salts to the formulation to attempt to mitigate this can impair matrix hydration and negatively impact drug release. An evaluation of the buffering of hydrophilic matrix tablets containing a pH - dependent solubility weak acid drug (flurbiprofen), identified as possessing a deleterious effect on hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) solubility, swelling and gelation, with respect to drug dissolution and the characteristics of the hydrophilic matrix gel layer in the presence of tromethamine as a buffer was undertaken. The inclusion of tromethamine as an alkalizing agent afforded pH - independent flurbiprofen release from matrices based on both HPMC 2910 (E series) and 2208 (K series), while concomitantly decreasing the apparent critical effect on dissolution mediated by this drug with respect to the early pseudo-gel layer formation and functionality. Drug release profiles were unaffected by matrix pH-changes resulting from loss of tromethamine over time, suggesting that HPMC inhibited precipitation of drug from supersaturated solution in the hydrated matrix. We propose that facilitation of diffusion-based release of potentially deleterious drugs in hydrophilic matrices may be achieved through judicious selection of a buffering species."}

In order to understand the responses of root system to mechanical stress induced by slope, samples of Spartium junceum L., growing in slope and in plane natural conditions, were compared in their morphology, biomechanical properties and anatomical features. Soils sampled in slope and plane revealed similar characteristics, with the exception of organic matter content and penetrometer resistance, both higher in slope. Slope significantly influenced root morphology and in particular the distribution of lateral roots along the soil depth. Indeed, first-order lateral roots of plants growing on slope condition showed an asymmetric distribution between up- and down-slope. Contrarily, this asymmetric distribution was not observed in plants growing in plane. The tensile strength was higher in lateral roots growing up-slope and in plane conditions than in those growing down-slope. Anatomical investigations revealed that, while roots grown up-slope had higher area covered by xylem fibers, the ratio of xylem and phloem fibers to root diameter did not differ among the three conditions, as also, no differences were found for xylem fiber cell wall thickness. Roots growing up-slope were the main contributors to anchorage properties, which included higher strength and higher number of fibers in the xylematic tissues. Results suggested that a combination of root - specific morphological, anatomical and biomechanical traits, determines anchorage functions in slope conditions."}

The disruption of thyroid hormones in the neonatal period may lead to permanent effects on thyroid hormone homeostasis as well as related developmental disorders, as thyroid hormones are essential for regulating the growth and differentiation of many tissues. To understand the long-term alteration in gene expressions by neonatal administration of thyroid hormone -like chemicals in general, we identified genes whose expression was altered in the liver, an important component of the thyroid hormone axis, by neonatal exposure to triiodothyronine (T3). T3 was administered to male F344 rats on postnatal days 1, 3, and 5 (week 0). At 8 weeks of age, cDNA microarray analysis was used to identify hepatic genes whose expression was altered by neonatal exposure to T3. Among the up-regulated genes that were identified, the expression of Olr59, Ethe1, and Slc10a2 increased specifically in rats neonatally exposed to T3. Interestingly, altered hepatic expression of these genes indeed increased when a hydroxylated polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE), OH-BDE42, which is capable of binding to the TR, was given neonatally. Our data demonstrated that neonatal exposure to thyroid hormones could affect the long-term expression of the genes, which could be useful markers for neonatal effects by thyroid hormone - disrupting chemicals.

Applicants to the University College of Teacher Education Styria (N = 243) completed personality scales as part of their college admission process. Half a year later, they retook the same personality scales in 1 of 3 randomly assigned experimental response conditions: honest, faking-good, or reproduce. Longitudinal means and covariance structure analyses showed that applicants ' response processes could be partially reproduced after half a year, and respondents seemed to rely on an honest response behavior as a frame of reference. Additionally, applicants ' faking behavior and instructed faking (faking-good) caused differences in the latent retest correlations and consistently affected measurement properties. The varying latent retest correlations indicated that faking can distort respondents ' rank-order and thus the fairness of subsequent selection decisions, depending on the kind of faking behavior. Instructed faking (faking-good) even affected weak measurement invariance, whereas applicants ' faking behavior did not. Consequently, correlations with personality scales -which can be utilized for predictive validity -may be readily interpreted for applicants. Faking behavior also introduced a uniform bias, implying that the classically observed mean raw score differences may not be readily interpreted."}

Malignant transformation and metastasis of meningiomas are rare. Moreover, most meningiomas are intracranial, and there are few reports on intraspinal meningiomas. This report aimed to describe the clinical features and pathological findings of a case of malignant transformation and distant metastasis of intraspinal meningioma, with a review of the literature. A 44-year-old man with a bilateral lower limb paresis was diagnosed with an intradural extramedullary tumor of the thoracic spine. Primary tumor resection was performed, and the histological findings revealed atypical meningioma. The meningioma recurred 2 years after the primary surgery, and a second resection was performed, but only partial resection was possible because of decreased motor evoked potential. At age 48, the patient's lower limb weakness returned, and a third resection was performed, and the histological finding remained atypical meningioma. At age 54, the tumor increased and stereotactic irradiation was performed. At age 60, the patient was diagnosed with metastatic tumors of the rib, lumbar vertebra, cervical spine, and sacrum. Biopsy of the rib metastatic tumor was performed, and the histological findings revealed anaplastic meningioma. This case is the first report of an intraspinal meningioma that transformed from atypical to anaplastic meningioma with distant hematogenous metastasis."}

This study analyzed the factors associated with SSI following HBPS in Japan, using a Japanese national database. Data on HBPS performed between 2012 and 2014 were extracted from a national monitoring system for HAI: The Japan Nosocomial Infections Surveillance. Using multivariate logistic regression, I assessed the factors associated with SSI. The cumulative incidence of SSI following HBPS was 15.6% (2873/18,398). The incidence of SSI after pancreatoduodenectomy was 28.0%, which was significantly higher than that after liver resection and other types of HBPS (8.8 and 15.5%, respectively). Among the four traditional risk factors, the American Society of Anesthesiologists score was ineffective for predicting SSI in the final model of all three types of surgery. Additional risk factors were identified, including age and male gender. The incidence of and factors associated with SSI after the three types of HBPS analyzed differed significantly. To accurately compare hospital performance in relation to SSI following HBPS, the operative procedure category in the surveillance system must be divided into three types."}

PC dysfunction is associated with disorders such as Crohn's disease and necrotizing enterocolitis, but the specific pathways regulating PC development and function are not fully understood. Here we tested the role of the neuregulin receptor ErbB3 in control of PC differentiation and the ISC niche. Intestinal epithelial ErbB3 knockout caused precocious appearance of PCs as early as postnatal day 7, and substantially increased the number of mature PCs in adult mouse ileum. ErbB3 loss had no effect on other secretory lineages, but increased expression of the ISC marker Lgr5. ErbB3 -null intestines had elevated levels of the Atoh1 transcription factor, which is required for secretory fate determination, while Atoh1(+) cells had reduced ErbB3, suggesting reciprocal negative regulation. ErbB3 -null intestinal progenitor cells showed reduced activation of the PI3K-Akt and ERK MAPK pathways. Inhibiting these pathways in HT29 cells increased levels of ATOH1 and the PC marker LYZ. Conversely, ErbB3 activation suppressed LYZ and ATOH1 in a PI3K - dependent manner. Expansion of the PC compartment in ErbB3 -null intestines was accompanied with elevated ER stress and inflammation markers, raising the possibility that negative regulation of PCs by ErbB3 is necessary to maintain homeostasis. Taken together, our data suggest that ErbB3 restricts PC numbers through PI3K -mediated suppression of Atoh1 levels leading to inhibition of PC differentiation, with important implications for regulation of the ISC niche."}

In this study, we aimed to investigate if the adverse effect of diabetes mellitus (DM) on early and late PCI outcomes is reduced with drug-eluting (DES) compared to bare-metal (BMS) stents. We reviewed the Mount Sinai Beth Israel Hospital first PCI experience for multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD, 1998-2009). Patients were excluded if they had single-vessel CAD, emergency, no stent, prior bypass graft or myocardial infarction <24h. Diabetes - effect was derived from 9- year all-cause mortality and re-intervention risk-adjusted hazard ratios [AHR (95% confidence intervals)] for DES (N=2679; 48% three-vessel; 39% DM) and BMS (N=2651; 40% three-vessel; 33% DM) and then stratified based on stent (DES / BMS) and vessel disease (two / three). Diabetes - effect on mortality was lower for DES (AHRDM/NoDM =1.41 [1.14-1.74]) versus BMS (AHRDM/NoDM =1.71 [1.50-2.01]), but this was predominantly driven by two-vessel patients. This diabetes effect was similar for first (DES1: AHRDM/NoDM =1.43 [1.14-1.79]) and second (DES2: AHRDM/NoDM =1.53 [0.77-3.07]) generation DES. Re-intervention comparisons were similarly increased by diabetes in all sub-cohorts. Our analysis of a large real-world PCI series indicates that diabetes is associated with worse 9- year mortality irrespective of stent type, albeit this is mitigated to varying degrees with DES, particularly in DES2 and in case of 2-vessel disease. A complementary stent - effect analysis confirmed DES -to- BMS and DES2 -to- DES1 superiority in both diabetics and non-diabetics."}

One monocot and two dicotyledon plants were grown in PAH - contaminated soil from a manufactured gas plant (MGP) site. A phytotoxicity assay confirmed greater soil decontamination in rhizospheres when compared to bulk soil controls. Bacteria were isolated from plant roots (rhizobacteria) and selected for growth on anthracene and chrysene on PAH - amended plates. Rhizosphere isolates metabolized 3- and 4-ring PAHs and PAH catabolic intermediates in liquid incubations.

We propose to use predictions of the risk of death from a joint model for a recurrent event and a terminal event, which account for disease relapse information. Two imputation methods were compared: sampling from the estimated parametric distribution of the survival time and sampling using its nonparametric estimation. The treatment effect and its standard error were estimated via multiple imputations.

Epithelia from the anterior eyes of chicken embryos were labeled with the fluorescent, lipophilic dye, 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI). DiI was placed on the epithelial surface of the developing anterior eye and its diffusion was monitored by fluorescence microscopy. Concomitant morphologic changes in the surface cells of these epithelial were examined by scanning electron microscopy. Immunofluorescence was used to analyze the expression of cytokeratin K3, ZO-1, N-cadherin and Connexin-43 and the function of gap junctions was analyzed using a cut-loading with the fluorescent dye rhodamine-dextran. Prior to embryonic day 8 (E 8), DiI placed on the surface of the CE spreads throughout all the epithelial cells of the anterior eye. When older eyes were similarly labeled, dye diffusion was restricted to the CE. Similarly, diffusion of DiI placed on the conjunctival surface after E 8 was restricted to the conjunctiva. Scanning electron microscopy showed that developmentally (1) physical separations progressively form between the cells of the CE and those of the conjunctiva, and (2) by E 8 these separations form a ring that completely encompasses the cornea. The functional restriction of gap junctions between these tissues did not occur until E 14.

The ryanodine receptors (RyR), intracellular Ca(2+)-release channels mainly expressed in excitable cell types including muscle and neurons, have however not yet been extensively studied in relation to autophagy. Yet, aberrant expression and excessive activity of RyRs in these tissues has been implicated in the onset of several diseases including Alzheimer's disease, where impaired autophagy regulation contributes to the pathology. In this study, we determined whether pharmacological RyR inhibition could modulate autophagic flux in ectopic RyR - expressing models, like HEK293 cells and in cell types that endogenously express RyR s, like C2C12 myoblasts and primary hippocampal neurons. Importantly, RyR3 overexpression in HEK293 cells impaired the autophagic flux. Conversely, in all cell models tested, pharmacological inhibition of endogenous or ectopically expressed RyRs, using dantrolene or ryanodine, augmented autophagic flux by increasing lysosomal turn-over (number of autophagosomes and autolysosomes measured as mCherry - LC3 punctae / cell increased from 70.37\u00b17.81 in control HEK RyR3 cells to 111.18\u00b17.72 and 98.14\u00b17.31 after dantrolene and ryanodine treatments, respectively). Moreover, in differentiated C2C12 cells, transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that dantrolene treatment decreased the number of early autophagic vacuoles from 5.9\u00b12.97 to 1.8\u00b11.03 per cellular cross section. The modulation of the autophagic flux could be linked to the functional inhibition of RyR channels as both RyR inhibitors efficiently diminished the number of cells showing spontaneous RyR3 activity in the HEK293 cell model (from 41.14%\u00b12.12 in control cells to 18.70%\u00b12.25 and 9.74%\u00b12.67 after dantrolene and ryanodine treatments, respectively).

Questionnaire-based screening for anxiety and depression symptoms (Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25) and previously diagnosed / treated depression at age 31 and 46. BMI, serum testosterone / free androgen index (FAI) and awareness of polycystic ovaries / PCOS on psychological distress were also assessed. Population-based prevalence of anxiety and/or depression in women with PCOS / PCOS symptoms at age s 31 and 46. Anxiety and/or depression symptoms, their coexistence and rate of depression were increased at age 31 and 46 in women with PCOS or isolated H compared with controls. High BMI or hyperandrogenism did not associate with increased anxiety or depression symptoms. The awareness of PCOS was associated with increased anxiety. Women with PCOS or isolated H present more often with anxiety and/or depression symptoms and their coexistence compared with controls. High BMI or hyperandrogenism did not provoke psychological distress in PCOS. The awareness of PCOS increased anxiety but did not associate with severe anxiety or depression."}

Here we report the first demonstration of single contig genome assembly using Oxford Nanopore native barcoding when applied to a multiplexed library of 12 samples and combined with existing Illumina short-read data. This paves the way for the closure of multiple bacterial genomes from a single MinION(TM) sequencing run, given the availability of existing short-read data. The strain we used, MHO_001, represents the important community-acquired methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus lineage USA300. Using a hybrid assembly of existing short read and barcoded long read sequences from multiplexed data, we completed a genome of the S. aureus USA300 strain MHO_001. The long-read data represented only ~5-10% of an average MinION(TM) run (~7x genomic coverage), but, using standard tools, this was sufficient to complete the circular chromosome of S. aureus strain MHO_001 (2.86 Mb) and two complete plasmids (27 Kb and 3 Kb). Minor differences were noted when compared to USA300 reference genome, USA300_FPR3757, including the translocation, loss and gain of mobile genetic elements. Here we demonstrate that MinION(TM) reads, multiplexed using native barcoding, can be used in combination with short-read data, to fully complete a bacterial genome. The ability to complete multiple genomes, for which short-read data is already available, from a single MinION(TM) run is set to impact on our understanding of accessory genome content, plasmid diversity and genome rearrangements."}

Our objective is to determine the effects of human - relevant exposure levels of DOX on follicular functions across developmental time. In vitro cultured multilayered secondary mouse follicles were treated with DOX at 0, 2, 20, 100, and 200 nM for 24 h, and follicle development, hormone secretion, and oocyte maturation were analyzed. DOX caused dose-dependent toxicity on follicle growth, survival, and secretion of 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2). At 200 nM, DOX induced DNA damage and apoptosis in follicle somatic cells first and then in oocytes, which was correlated with the uptake of DOX first to the somatic cells followed by germ cells. Follicles treated with DOX at 0, 2, and 20 nM showed similar oocyte metaphase II (MII) percentages after in vitro oocyte maturation; however, 20 nM DOX significantly increased the number of MII oocytes with abnormal spindle morphology and chromosome misalignment. In an effort to harmonize the in vitro study to in vivo treatment, dose-dependent toxicity on oocyte meiotic maturation was found in 16-day-old CD-1 mice treated with DOX at 0, 0.4, 2, and 10 mg/kg, consistent with the in vitro oocyte maturation outcomes. Our study demonstrates that DOX has dose-dependent toxicity on ovarian follicle development, hormone secretion, and oocyte maturation, which are three key factors to support the female reproductive and endocrine functions."}

Human prostate cancer DU145 cells were treated with different concentrations of fish oil, omega-3 PUFA (DHA, and Eicosapentaenoic acid, EPA), or omega-6 PUFA (Arachidonic acid, AA). Cell viability and apoptosis were evaluated by MTT assay and Hoechst staining. Pathway-focused gene expression profiling of DU145 cells was analyzed with the RT(2) Profile PCR Array System. The results were verified by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). AA exposure showed no obvious effect on viability of DU145 cells. However, exposure with fish oil, EPA, or DHA for 24 h significantly affected cell viability. The growth inhibition of DHA was more pronounced than that of EPA and showed a time-dependent increase. DHA exposure caused typical apoptotic characteristics. Ten genes were more expressed, while 5 genes were less expressed following DHA exposure. RT-qPCR confirmed the time dependent effect of DHA on the expression of these differentially expressed genes. KEGG pathway analysis showed that DHA may induce the apoptosis of cancer cells preferentially through mediating P53, MAPK, TNF, PI3K/AKT, and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways. Our study demonstrated the beneficial action of DHA on human prostate carcinoma cell line DU145. The pro-apoptotic effect of DHA on DU145 cells may involve mediation various pathways, especially P53, MAPK, TNF, PI3K/AKT, and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways. Molecular mechanisms of DHA on apoptosis of cancer cells still need to be further clarified."}

Medication reconciliation is a fundamental process that to be effective, it should be embraced during each single care transition. Our objectives were to investigate current medication reconciliation practices in the 2 Fondazione Toscana Gabriele Monasterio hospitals and comprehensively assess the quality of medication reconciliation practices between inpatient and outpatient care by analyzing the medication patterns 6 months before admission, during hospitalization, and 9 months after discharge for a selected group of patients with cardiovascular diseases. A retrospective observational study was conducted in the Cardiothoracic Department of the Fondazione Toscana Gabriele Monasterio hospitals. Medication history was reviewed for all the patients admitted from and discharged to the community, from January to March 2013. Patients were excluded if they had less than 4 drugs or less than 2 drugs for cardiovascular system in their prescription list at admission or if they died during follow-up. We selected 714 patients, and we obtained the clinical charts and all drug prescriptions collected during patients ' hospitalization by the electronic clinical recording system. We also analyzed the list of prescriptions of this sample of patients, from 6 months before admission to 9 months after discharge, extracted from the regional prescription registry. In the resulting sample, prescriptions were analyzed to assess unintentional discrepancies. The study included 298 patients (mean age, 71.2 years), according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Among 14,573 prescriptions analyzed, we found 4363 discrepancies (14.6 discrepancies per patient). Among these discrepancies, 1310 were classified as unintentional (4.4 discrepancies per patient). Among unintentional discrepancies, only 63 (4.8%) took place during hospitalization. Although at the hospital-home interface, 33.1% of unintentional discrepancies were detected through the comparison between the patients ' declared therapy and the previous medication consumption and 62.1% were identified in the comparison between the prescription at the discharge and the following medication pattern at home. Medication errors have important implications for patient safety, and their identification is a main target for improving clinical practice. The comparison between the medication patterns acquired through the regional prescription registry before and after hospitalization outlined critical touchpoint in the current medication reconciliation process, calling for the definition of shared medication reconciliation standards between hospitals and primary care services to minimize medication discrepancies and enhance patient safety."}

A retrospective clinical study was conducted among patients who had undergone rhinoseptoplasty using ACC or IHCC from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2014. Patients were followed up for more than 1 year after surgery and the histologic characteristics of ACC and IHCC were compared. The details of the surgical procedures and complications, including warping, infection, resorption, and/or donor-site morbidity, were evaluated by reviewing medical records and facial photographs. Patients ' subjective satisfaction with aesthetic and functional results was evaluated using a questionnaire. The details of the surgical procedures and complications, including warping, infection, resorption, and/or donor-site morbidity; patients ' subjective satisfaction with aesthetic and functional results ' objective evaluation of surgical outcomes, including symmetry, dorsal height, dorsal length, dorsal width, tip projection, tip rotation, tip width, and overall result; and histologic structures. Objective evaluation of surgical outcomes was graded using the Objective Rhinoplasty Outcome Score, which assessed symmetry, dorsal height, dorsal length, dorsal width, tip projection, tip rotation, tip width, and overall result. Histologic structures were evaluated using hematoxylin and eosin, Masson trichrome, Alcian blue, and Verhoeff elastic stains. A total of 63 patients (27 males and 36 females; mean [SD] age, 30.6 [9.5] years) had rhinoseptoplasty using ACC and 20 (9 males and 11 females; mean [SD] age, 35.4 [15.4] years) had rhinoseptoplasty using IHCC. Among observed complications, only notable resorption occurred more frequently in patients using IHCC (6 [30%]) than with ACC (2 [3%]) (P = .002). In subjective evaluations of aesthetic satisfaction, patients who received ACC showed significantly greater satisfaction (37 of 51 patients [73%] were very satisfied) than did those who received IHCC (6 of 20 [30%]) (P = .001). However, there was no between-group difference in subjective functional outcomes: 4 of 51 patients receiving ACC (8%) and 5 of 20 receiving IHCC (25%) were satisfied (P = .50) and 45 of 51 receiving ACC (88%) and 15 of 20 receiving IHCC (75%) were very satisfied (P = .15). Regarding objective aesthetic outcomes, all scores for both ACC and IHCC were more than 3.1 (between good and excellent). Histologic analyses showed larger, more evenly distributed, uniform chondrocytes and more collagens and proteoglycan contents in ACC than in IHCC. Compared with patients receiving IHCC, those receiving ACC for rhinoseptoplasty showed superior aesthetic satisfaction; ACC also had less frequent notable resorption.

Here, using gene knockouts in mice we evaluated genetic interaction between loss of Ret and loss of Sema3d, two Hirschsprung disease susceptibility genes. We intercrossed Ret and Sema3d double null heterozygotes to generate mice with the nine possible genotypes and assessed survival by counting various genotypes, myenteric plexus presence by acetylcholinesterase staining and embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) intestine transcriptome by RNA-sequencing. Survival rates of Ret wildtype, null heterozygote and null homozygote mice at E12.5, birth and weaning were not influenced by the genotypes at Sema3d locus and vice-versa. Loss of myenteric plexus was observed only in all Ret null homozygotes, irrespective of the genotypes at Sema3d locus, and Sema3d null heterozygote and homozygote mice had normal intestinal innervation. As compared to wildtype mice intestinal gene expression, loss of Ret in null homozygotes led to differential expression of \u223c300 genes, whereas loss of Sema3d in null homozygotes had no major consequence and there was no evidence supporting major interaction between the two genes influencing intestine transcriptome. Overall, given the null alleles and phenotypic assays used, we did not find evidence for genetic interaction between Ret and Sema3d affecting survival, presence of myenteric plexus or intestine transcriptome."}

This development of these checkpoint inhibitors has greatly influenced our approach to the treatment of lung cancer in first and second line. The limited toxicity profile and the ability to treat for prolonged periods, even in smokers, is a welcome expansion of the therapeutic arsenal of the oncologist. Areas covered: This review highlights the results of recent clinical trials on pembrolizumab for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. The authors discuss both first and second line treatment with pembrolizumab as monotherapy and in combination therapies. Additionally, implications of the PD-L1 immunohistochemistry assay with the 22C3 antibody and its use in clinical practice and trials is discussed. Expert commentary: A higher overall response, overall survival and a moderate toxicity profile is observed with the use of pembrolizumab, compared to chemotherapy, in both first and second line. These promising results have already translated into the registration of pembrolizumab in first and second line in patients with a high expression of PD-L1. However, as PD-L1 staining does not sufficiently discriminate responders from non-responders for all checkpoint inhibitors, there still is a need for a better predictive biomarker."}

The temporal relationship between the apical and radial meristems can help in the understanding of tree growth as a whole process. The aim of this study was to compare cambial phenology in black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) provenances classified as early and late bud flushing. The different phases of cambial phenology were assessed on wood microcores sampled weekly from April to October in 2014 and 2015 from 61 trees growing in a provenance trial in Quebec, Canada. Trees showing an early bud flush also exhibited early reactivation of xylem differentiation, although an average difference of 12 days for buds corresponded to small although significant differences of 4 days for xylem. Provenances with early bud flush had an early bud set and completed xylem formation earlier than late bud flush provenances. No significant difference in the period of xylem formation and total growth was observed between the flushing classes. Our results demonstrate that the ecotype differentiation of black spruce provenances represented by the phenological adaptation of buds to the local climate corresponds to specific growth dynamics of the xylem."}

High - efficiency screening methods which measure the kinetics of liposomes with a variety of compounds require the immobilization of liposomes. In this work, a method is described for immobilizing liposomes for interaction studies, based on the biophysical principles of this biosensor platform. The immobilization approach includes the loading of DSPE-PEG(2000) - biotin containing sterically stabilized micelles (SSMs) which are restructured in a buffer change step, resulting in an accessible substrate for liposome immobilization. Liposomes in a concentration of 5mM of varying composition and fluidity were immobilized on the sensor surface by inserting the hydrophobic residues of the former loaded SSMs. This proof of principle was carried out using Cytochrome C as a membrane-interacting model protein. The binding of Cytochrome C to the immobilized liposomes was demonstrated, and the derived kinetic and affinity constants were similar to values given in the literature. In order to obtain a detailed understanding of this surface, and to show the integrity of the liposomes, confocal fluorescence microscopy was used. Images of immobilized liposomes containing calcein in the aqueous core indicated intact vesicles. A combination of this simple liposome immobilization approach, the possibility of automation on BLI systems with high throughput within an acceptable timescale and excellent reproducibility makes this assay suitable for basic research as well as for industrial and regulatory applications."}

We have investigated the effects of chronic intrathecal (IT) administration using enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) to the brain of an LINCL mouse model, in which locomotor function declines dramatically prior to early death. Median lifespan was significantly extended from 126 days to >259 days when chronic IT treatment was initiated before the onset of disease. While treated animals lived longer and showed little sign of locomotor dysfunction as measured by stride length, some or all (depending on regimen) still died prematurely. One explanation is that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-mediated delivery may not deliver TPP1 to all brain regions. Morphological studies support this, showing delivery of TPP1 to ventral, but not deeper and dorsal regions. When IT treatment is initiated in severely affected LINCL mice, lifespan was extended modestly in most but dramatically extended in approximately one-third of the cohort. Treatment improved locomotor function in these severely compromised animals after it had declined to the point at which animals normally die. This indicates that some pathology in LINCL is reversible and does not simply reflect neuronal death."}

Collagen scaffolds are widely available and could be used intra-articularly, but no investigation has looked at the safety of collagen scaffolds within synovial joints. The aim of this study was to determine the safety of collagen scaffold implantation in a validated in vivo animal model of knee arthrofibrosis. A total of 96 rabbits were randomly and equally assigned to four different groups: arthrotomy alone; arthrotomy and collagen scaffold placement; contracture surgery; and contracture surgery and collagen scaffold placement. Animals were killed in equal numbers at 72 hours, two weeks, eight weeks, and 24 weeks. Joint contracture was measured, and cartilage and synovial samples underwent histological analysis. Animals that underwent arthrotomy had equivalent joint contractures regardless of scaffold implantation (-13.9\u00b0 versus -10.9\u00b0, equivalence limit 15\u00b0). Animals that underwent surgery to induce contracture did not demonstrate equivalent joint contracture s with (41.8\u00b0) or without (53.9\u00b0) collagen scaffold implantation. Chondral damage occurred in similar rates with (11 of 48) and without (nine of 48) scaffold implantation. No significant difference in synovitis was noted between groups. Absorption of the collagen scaffold occurred within eight weeks in all animals CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that intra-articular implantation of a collagen sponge does not induce synovitis or cartilage damage. Implantation in a native joint does not seem to induce contracture.

To assess whether B. dolosa significantly contributes to disease or is recognized by the host immune response, mice were infected with a sequenced outbreak B. dolosa strain, AU0158, and responses compared to the well-studied CF pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa In parallel, mice were also infected with a polar flagellin mutant of B. dolosa to examine the role of flagella in B. dolosa lung colonization. The results showed a higher persistence in the host by B. dolosa strains and yet neutrophil recruitment and cytokine production were lower compared to P. aeruginosa The ability of host immune cells to recognize B. dolosa was then assessed and B. dolosa induced a robust cytokine response in cultured cells and this effect was dependent on the flagella only when bacteria were dead. Together, these results suggest that B. dolosa can be recognized by host cells in vitro but may avoid or suppress the host immune response in vivo through unknown mechanisms. B. dolosa was then compared to other Burkholderia species and found to induce similar levels of cytokine production despite being internalized by macrophages more than B. cenocepacia strains.

Here, we show that human LGR5(+) colorectal cancer cells serve as CSCs in growing cancer tissues. Lineage - tracing experiments with a tamoxifen -inducible Cre knock-in allele of LGR5 reveal the self-renewal and differentiation capacity of LGR5(+) tumour cells. Selective ablation of LGR5(+) CSCs in LGR5 -i Caspase9 knock-in organoids leads to tumour regression, followed by tumour regrowth driven by re-emerging LGR5(+) CSCs. KRT20 knock-in reporter marks differentiated cancer cells that constantly diminish in tumour tissues, while reverting to LGR5(+) CSCs and contributing to tumour regrowth after LGR5(+) CSC ablation.

TaqMan probe-based quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was conducted to examine the levels of XRCC1-399 and ERCC1-118 SNPs in the peripheral blood of 50 patients with pathologically confirmed ESCC. In addition, the associations between different genotypes and short-term therapeutic efficacy [the complete remission (CR) rate], tumor metastasis and relapse, as well as the survival time following concurrent radiochemotherapy, were determined. A total of 50 ESCC patients who received concurrent radiochemotherapy were enrolled. It was found that the short-term therapeutic efficacy (CR rate) was higher in the group of patients carrying the homozygous mutation of XRCC1-399 (A / A genotype) than in the group of patients without the XRCC1-399 mutation (G / G genotype). In addition, the CR rate was significantly increased in patients carrying one or two ERCC1-118 C alleles (C / C or C / T genotype) compared with patients lacking the C allele (T / T genotype).

However, XRCC1-399 SNP had no effect on survival time (P>0.05). XRCCl-399 SNP was associated with the short-term therapeutic efficacy (the CR rate) and tumor metastasis / relapse in ESCC patients who received the docetaxel plus cisplatin (TP) regimen -based concurrent radiochemotherapy. By contrast, ERCC1-118 SNP was significantly associated with the short-term therapeutic efficacy (the CR rate) and survival time in ESCC patients who received TP regimen -based concurrent radiochemotherapy."}

Maximizing the geographic separation of right and left ventricular pacing lead sites has been suggested as one way to improve response. Cardiac CT provides an opportunity to explore 3-dimensional inter-lead distance (ILD) measures for the prediction of CRT response. The objective of this study was to investigate associations between standardized measures of ILD by cardiac CT and echocardiographic response to CRT. Forty-two consecutive patients undergoing CRT had serial clinical and echocardiographic evaluations performed in addition to a post-procedural cardiac -gated CT with blinded measurement of direct and circumferential (via the myocardium) ILD measures. Clinical response to CRT, the primary clinical outcome, was defined as a \u226515% reduction in LVESV using echocardiography at 6-months. The mean age and ejection fraction was 63.6 \u00b1 8.9 years and 25.2 \u00b1 7.8%, respectively. The primary outcome occurred in 35 of 42 patients (83%). Both direct and circumferential CT -based ILD measures were associated with the primary outcome by univariate analysis. Receiver Operator Characteristic analysis identified Circumferential ILD to have the strongest predictive accuracy (AUC 0.78). Inter- and intra-observer reproducibility of CT -derived ILD measures was excellent. Circumferential ILD measures on cardiac CT are predictive of clinical response to CRT. Incorporation of these measures into the selection of optimal pacing targets, particularly from pre-procedural CT coronary vein imaging may be of therapeutic benefit and warrants further investigation."}

The concentration of iodine in the thyroid is the most accurate indicator of iodine nutrition. This study aimed to evaluate whether the iodine stores in the thyroid cover the needs of the mother and the fetus in iodine - sufficient and MMID conditions by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. One hundred four-week-old female Wistar rats were randomly divided into MMID (low iodine intake [L]) and normal (normal iodine intake [N]) groups. The rats were fed for the next three months, and after pregnancy they were further divided into two subgroups, respectively: low iodine pregnancy (LP) and low iodine pregnancy with iodine supplement (LP+), and normal iodine intake pregnancy (NP) and normal iodine intake pregnancy with iodine supplement (NP+). The iodine intake of pregnant rats in the NP+ and LP+ groups was twice as much as in the NP and LP groups. The rats were sacrificed on gestational day 15 and postnatal day 7. The iodine concentration in the thyroid of the maternal and newborn rats, maternal serum, placenta, and amniotic fluid were determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. The concentration of iodine in the thyroid of the N group was significantly higher than that in the L group before pregnancy. The concentration of iodine in the maternal thyroids of the LP group decreased during pregnancy, whereas that of the NP group did not change significantly. There was no significant difference in the iodine concentration in the thyroid of mothers and offspring between the NP and NP+ groups, but it was significant between LP and LP+ groups. The concentration of iodine in amniotic fluid was significantly different between the four groups. There is sufficient iodine storage in the thyroid of maternal rats with normal iodine intake during pregnancy, and there is no need for iodine supplementation. However, iodine stores are insufficient in rats with MMID. Iodine supplementation can increase the iodine concentration in the thyroid of maternal rats with MMID and their offspring, as well as in the amniotic fluid during pregnancy."}

Rats were killed 30 days after pulp exposure, and jaws were subjected to histologic and immunohistochemical analyses. Immunohistochemical analyses were performed to detect tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase - positive osteoclasts and osteocalcin - positive osteoblasts on the bone surface of periapical area. Results were statistically evaluated by using analysis of variance and Tukey honestly significant difference, and P < .05 was considered statistically significant. The bone resorption lesion was significantly larger in the AP group compared with AP -O, C, and C-O groups (P < .05). The level of inflammatory cell infiltration was significantly elevated, and the number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase - positive osteoclasts was significantly higher in the periapical lesions of the AP group compared with AP -O, C, and C-O groups (P < .05). The number of osteocalcin - positive osteoblasts was significantly increased in the AP -O group compared with the AP group (P > .05).

Here we report that despite systematically testing different ways of measuring intracellular calcium and different MS protocols, it was not possible to detect any cellular or neuronal responses to MS in MagR - expressing HEK cells or primary neurons from the dorsal root ganglion and the hippocampus.

This comorbidity has been independently associated with adverse outcomes including an increase in mortality. Postoperative acute kidney injury has a complex pathophysiology with many risk factors, and therefore no single medication or therapy has been demonstrated to be effective for treatment or prevention. However, it has been established that the associated fluid overload is one of the major determinants of morbidity, particularly in infants after cardiac surgery. Therefore, in the absence of an intervention to prevent acute kidney injury, much of the effort to improve outcomes has focused on treating and preventing fluid overload. Early renal replacement therapy, often in the form of peritoneal dialysis, has been shown to be safe and beneficial in infants with oliguria after heart surgery. As understanding of the pathophysiology of acute kidney injury and the ability to confidently diagnose it earlier continues to evolve, it is likely that novel preventative and therapeutic interventions will be available in the future."}

Toward this aim, Systems Toxicology entails the integration of in vitro and in vivo toxicity data with computational modeling. This evolving approach depends critically on data reliability and relevance, which in turn depends on the quality of experimental models and bioanalysis techniques used to generate toxicological data. Systems Toxicology involves the use of large-scale data streams (\"big data \"), such as those derived from omics measurements that require computational means for obtaining informative results. Thus, integrative analysis of multiple molecular measurements, particularly acquired by omics strategies, is a key approach in Systems Toxicology. In recent years, there have been significant advances centered on in vitro test systems and bioanalytical strategies, yet a frontier challenge concerns linking observed network perturbations to phenotypes, which will require understanding pathways and networks that give rise to adverse responses. This summary perspective from a 2016 Systems Toxicology meeting, an international conference held in the Alps of Switzerland, describes the limitations and opportunities of selected emerging applications in this rapidly advancing field. Systems Toxicology aims to change the basis of how adverse biological effects of xenobiotics are characterized, from empirical end points to pathways of toxicity.

Rapid assessment by first responders / emergency nurses is required to reduce death and disability. Currently, no informatics tools for irritant gas syndrome agent s (IGSA) exposures exist to process victims efficiently, continuously monitor for latent signs/symptoms, or make triage recommendations. This study describes the first step in developing ED informatics tools for chemical incidents: validation of signs/symptoms that characterize an IGSA syndrome. Data abstracted from 146 patients treated for chlorine exposure in one emergency department during a 2005 train derailment and 152 patients not exposed to chlorine (a comparison group) were mapped to 93 possible signs/symptoms within 2 tools (WISER and CHEMM-IST) designed to assist emergency responders / emergency nurses with managing hazardous material exposures. Inferential statistics (\u03c7(2)/ Fisher's exact test) and diagnostics tests were used to examine mapped signs/symptoms of persons who were and were not exposed to chlorine. Three clusters of signs/symptoms are statistically associated with an IGSA syndrome (P < .01): respiratory (shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing, and choking); chest discomfort (tightness, pain, and burning), and eye, nose and/or throat (pain, irritation, and burning). The syndrome requires the presence of signs/symptoms from at least 2 of these clusters. The latency period must also be considered for exposed / potentially exposed persons. This study uses actual patient data from a chemical incident to characterize and validate signs/symptoms of an IGSA syndrome. Validating signs/symptoms is the first step in developing new ED informatics tools with the potential to revolutionize the process by which emergency nurses manage triage victims of chemical incidents."}

Morphological analysis showed that loss of Fyn function impaired multipolar - bipolar transition of newly generated neurons and neurite formation in the early phase of migration. Moreover, Fyn inhibition increased the length of leading process and decreased the branching number of the migrating cortical neurons.

The RNA or DNA of collagens were purified from sera, and detected by polymerase chain reaction or quantitated by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Among approximately 18 360 bases of full-length \u03b11(I) collagen DNA, various regions were detected by polymerase chain reaction in human sera. However, \u03b12(I) collagen DNA, \u03b11(I) collagen RNA or \u03b12(I) collagen RNA were not detectable. \u03b11(I) Collagen DNA in sera was quantitative using our method. The levels of serum \u03b11(I) collagen DNA were significantly increased in scleroderma patients compared with healthy control subjects or systemic lupus erythematosus patients. According to the receiver-operator curve analysis, serum \u03b11(I) collagen DNA levels were shown to be effective as a diagnostic marker of scleroderma. Furthermore, when we determined the association of serum \u03b11(I) collagen DNA levels with clinical / laboratory features in scleroderma patients, those with elevated \u03b11(I) collagen DNA levels showed significantly higher prevalence of pitting scars / ulcers. In summary, elevation of serum \u03b11(I) collagen DNA levels in scleroderma patients may be useful as the diagnostic marker, reflecting the presence of vasculopathy. Jou rna"}

Here, we have enhanced these surfaces with silver (Ag) to provide a second tier of MSI data from a single sample. MSI data was acquired through the application of laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry to biological samples imprinted onto desorption/ionization on silicon (DIOS) substrates. Following initial analysis, ultra-thin Ag layers were overlaid onto the followed by MSI analysis (Ag-DIOS MSI). This approach was first demonstrated for fingermark small molecules including environmental contaminants and sebum components. Subsequently, this bimodal method was translated to lipids and metabolites in fore-stomach sections from a 6-bromoisatin chemopreventative murine mouse model. DIOS MSI allowed mapping of common ions in fingermarks as well as 6-bromoisatin metabolites and lipids in murine fore-stomach. Furthermore, DIOS MSI was complemented by the Ag-DIOS MSI of Ag-adductable lipids such as wax esters in fingermarks and cholesterol in murine fore-stomach. Gastrointestinal acid condensation products of 6-bromoisatin, such as the 6,6'-dibromoindirubin mapped herein, are very challenging to isolate and characterize. By re-analyzing the same tissue imprints, this metabolite was readily detected by DIOS, placed in a tissue-specific spatial context, and subsequently overlaid with additional lipid distributions acquired using Ag-DIOS MSI. The ability to place metabolite and lipid classes in a tissue-specific context makes this novel method suited to MSI analyses where the collection of additional information from the same sample maximises resource use, and also maximises the number of annotated small molecules, in particular for metabolites that are typically undetectable with traditional platforms.

We found that care providers described the contact with Turkish and Moroccan parents as more difficult. They offered two reasons for this: (1) language barriers between care provider and parents hindered the exchange of information; (2) cultural barriers between care provider and parents about sharing the diagnosis and palliative perspective hindered communication. Care providers reported different solutions to deal with these barriers, such as using an interpreter and improving their cultural knowledge about their patients. They, however, were not using interpreters sufficiently and were unaware of the importance of eliciting parents ' perspectives. Communication techniques to overcome dilemmas between parents and care providers were not used and care providers were unaware of stereotypes and prejudice.

At child age 3.5 to 4 years, maternal -reported child eating behaviors and psychological problems were collected via valid tools, and child weight and height data were collected by trained study staff. Pearson's correlations and linear regressions examined associations between eating behaviors, psychological problems, and BMI z score. Multiple mediation models were tested by assessing indirect effects of psychological problems on BMI z score via obesogenic eating behaviors. Peer problems were associated with both higher food responsiveness and emotional overeating and directly with higher BMI z score. This relationship was partially mediated by emotional overeating. Both emotional overeating and food responsiveness fully mediated the association between emotional problems and BMI z score, and food responsiveness fully mediated the association between conduct problems and BMI z score. The findings suggest that children with psychological problems may also display obesogenic eating behaviors, which may result in higher BMI. This needs to be considered in the clinical management of both pediatric overweight / obesity and psychological problems."}

However, there is uncertainty regarding possible alterations in peripheral Hcy levels in BD. This study comprises a meta-analysis comparing serum and plasma Hcy levels in persons with BD and healthy controls. We conducted a systematic search for all eligible English and non-English peer-reviewed articles. Nine cross-sectional studies were included in the meta-analyses, providing data on 1547 participants. Random-effects meta-analysis showed that serum and plasma levels of Hcy were increased in subjects with BD in either mania or euthymia when compared to healthy controls, with a large effect size in the mania group (g=0.98, 95% CI: 0.8-1.17, P<0.001, n=495) and a small effect in the euthymia group (g=0.3, 95% CI: 0.11-0.48, P=0.002, n=1052). Our meta-analysis provides evidence that Hcy levels are elevated in persons with BD during mania and euthymia. Peripheral Hcy could be considered as a potential biomarker in BD, both of trait (since it is increased in euthymia), and also of state (since its increase is more accentuated in mania).

Three hundred Patients with AUD (74.9% smoking) were recruited from two inpatient detoxification units in psychiatric hospitals in Germany and their alcohol consumption was prospectively followed for 1 year. Data on different indicators of smoking behavior was gathered. Cox regression model was used to evaluate potential risk factors on time to relapse of alcohol consumption. Two hundred seventy-nine participants (n = 279) were included in the final analysis. Smoking increased the risk for alcohol relapse (hazard ratio = 3.962, 95% CI 1.582-9.921). However, this increased risk is slightly reduced with higher numbers of daily consumed cigarettes (hazard ratio per cigarette = .986, 95% CI .976-.995). Smoking reduced the probability of maintaining alcohol abstinence significantly, whereas higher number of cigarettes smoked daily diminished the increased risk of alcohol relapse in alcohol-dependent patients. Coordinated psychiatric and substance abuse interventions for different subgroups of patients with AUD in the post-acute treatment phase are necessary.

Encoding and retrieval are supported by the engagement of both distinct neural pathways across the cortex and common structures within the medial temporal lobes. However, the degree to which memory performance can be determined by neural processing that is common to encoding and retrieval remains to be determined. To identify neural signatures of successful memory function, we administered a delayed free-recall task to 187 neurosurgical patients implanted with subdural or intraparenchymal depth electrodes. We developed multivariate classifiers to identify patterns of spectral power across the brain that independently predicted successful episodic encoding and retrieval. During encoding and retrieval, patterns of increased high frequency activity in prefrontal, MTL, and inferior parietal cortices, accompanied by widespread decreases in low frequency power across the brain predicted successful memory function. Using a cross-decoding approach, we demonstrate the ability to predict memory function across distinct phases of the free-recall task. Furthermore, we demonstrate that classifiers that combine information from both encoding and retrieval states can outperform task-independent models. These findings suggest that the engagement of a core memory network during either encoding or retrieval shapes the ability to remember the past, despite distinct neural interactions that facilitate encoding and retrieval."}

Retrospective, single-center quasi-experimental study of hospitalized patients with SAB. During the intervention period, pharmacists were alerted to patients with SAB via a patient scoring tool integrated into the electronic medical record. Pharmacists utilized the scoring tool and the institution's evidence-based practice guideline to make standardized recommendations to promote adherence to SAB quality-of-care measures and encourage ID consultation. The primary outcome was overall compliance along with adherence to individual quality-of-care components. Secondary clinical outcomes were also analyzed. 84 patients were identified for study inclusion, 45 in the pre- intervention and 39 in the intervention group. As a whole, all four quality-of-care components for the management of SAB were significantly more frequently adhered to in the intervention group (68.9% vs. 92.3%; P=0.008). The incidence of ID consult improved significantly by almost 20% in the intervention group (75.6% vs. 94.9%, P=0.015). No statistically significant differences in duration of bacteremia, length-of-stay, infection -related length-of-stay, or readmission were observed between the groups. The incidence of all-cause mortality was 6-fold higher in the pre- intervention group compared to the intervention group (15.6% vs. 2.6%, P=0.063). An automated, pharmacist -driven intervention for the management of patients with SAB demonstrated a significant improvement in patients receiving an ID consult, targeted antimicrobial therapy, and adherence to all SAB quality-of-care measures. As antimicrobial stewardship becomes a mandatory aspect of healthcare in all hospitals in the U.S., ASPs will be forced to find ways to provide more efficient, impactful, disease state-based patient care.

Even in rat brain slices bathed in CaEDTA in ACSF, intracellular Zn(2+) level, which was measured with intracellular ZnAF-2, was increased in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare where perforant pathway - CA1 pyramidal cell synapses were contained after tetanic stimulation. These results suggest that intracellular Zn(2+) signaling, which originates in internal stores/ proteins, is involved in LTP at perforant pathway - CA1 pyramidal cell synapses. Because the influx of extracellular Zn(2+), which originates in presynaptic Zn(2+) release, is involved in LTP at Schaffer collateral - CA1 pyramidal cell synapses, synapse -dependent Zn(2+) dynamics may be involved in plasticity of postsynaptic CA1 pyramidal cells."}

However, their broad tissue presence and other evidence are indicative of nonimmune functions. We examined a role for immunoproteasomes in cellular responses to the endogenous and environmental carcinogen formaldehyde (FA) that binds to cytosolic and nuclear proteins producing proteotoxic stress and genotoxic DNA - histone crosslinks. We found that immunoproteasomes were important for suppression of a caspase-independent cell death and the long-term survival of FA-treated cells. All major genotoxic responses to FA, including replication inhibition and activation of the transcription factor p53 and the apical ATM and ATR kinases, were unaffected by immunoproteasome inactivity. Immunoproteasome inhibition enhanced activation of the cytosolic protein damage sensor HSF1, elevated levels of K48-polyubiquitinated cytoplasmic proteins and increased depletion of unconjugated ubiquitin. We further found that FA induced the disassembly of 26S immunoproteasomes, but not standard 26S proteasomes, releasing the 20S catalytic immunoproteasome. FA-treated cells also had higher amounts of small activators PA28\u03b1\u03b2 and PA28\u03b3 bound to 20S particles. Our findings highlight the significance of nonnuclear damage in FA injury and reveal a major role for immunoproteasomes in elimination of FA-damaged cytoplasmic proteins through ubiquitin - independent proteolysis."}

There is, however, limited research providing a comprehensive MSK pain profile of an obese cohort. This retrospective study utilized a patient database at a national weight management service (WMS). Following ethical approval, anonymized patient data were statistically analyzed to develop a pain profile, investigate relationships between pain, sleep, and function, and explore variables associated with having low back pain (LBP) and knee pain. Overall, 915 individuals attended the WMS from January 2011 to September 2015 [male, 35% (n=318; CI =32-38); female, 65% (n=597; CI =62-68); mean age 44.6]. Mean BMI was 50.7 kg/m2 [Class III obese (BMI \u226540 kg/m2), 92% (n=835; CI =91-94)]. Approximately 91% reported MSK pain: LBP, 69% (n=539; CI =65- 72) [mean NRS 7.4]; knee pain, 58% (n=447; CI =55-61) [mean NRS 6.8]. Class III obese and multi-site pain patients had lower QoL and physical activity levels, reduced sleep, and poorer physical function than less obese patients and those without pain (p<0.05). Relationships were found between demographic, pain, self-report, psychological, and functional measures (p<0.05). Patients who slept fewer hours and had poorer functional outcomes were more likely to have LBP; patients who were divorced, had lower QoL, and more frequent nocturia were more likely to have knee pain (p<0.05). Multi-site MSK pain is prevalent and severe in obese patients and is negatively associated with most self-report and functional outcomes. This high prevalence suggests pain management strategies must be considered when treating obesity."}

Five young (\u00d8 2.0 years) and five old (\u00d8 10.4 years) healthy and sound Beagle dogs were measured during locomotion on a treadmill by computer-assisted gait analysis. Angles of the shoulder, elbow, carpal, hip, stifle and tarsal joints were analyzed, including joint angle progression curves, minimum and maximum joint angles and range of motion (ROM). The old group showed a smaller maximum joint angle (p = 0.037) and ROM (p = 0.037) of the carpal joint and similar tendencies in the shoulder, elbow and carpal joint. The descriptive analysis of the progression curves revealed less flexion and extension of the joints of the forelimb. This indicates restricted joint mobility of the forelimb but primarily of the carpal joint. Findings in the joints of the hindlimb were not consistent; contrasting alterations may be due to a compensatory mechanism. As most alterations were found in the distal joints, these should receive particular attention when examining elderly dogs."}

Men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with primary prostate cryotherapy from 1993-2013 were selected from the Cryo On-Line Data Registry for a 1:1 matched comparison between those undergoing whole - gland and partial prostate cryotherapy (targeted-ablation, unilateral/bilateral nerve-sparing ablations). A propensity score was developed based on age, pre-biopsy serum PSA, biopsy Gleason score, clinical stage, prostate volume, neoadjuvant androgen deprivation status, year of surgery and pre-treatment potency. Outcomes were biochemical progression-free survival (BPFS) using ASTRO and Phoenix criteria, 12-month continence (strictly pad-free) and sexual function (potency sufficient for sexual intercourse). After propensity score - matching, BPFS was compared using Kaplan-Meier analysis and functional outcomes using chi-square tests. In all, 897 men were identified (731 whole - gland and 166 partial). Post-matching, 166 pairs of men were analysed (mean follow-up 31 months). The 2/5 year BPFS rate was 87.2%/76.4% for whole - gland vs. 80.7%/70.0% for partial ablation using Phoenix (p=0.26) and 72.3%/69.6% for whole gland vs. 82.1%/75.0% for partial ablation using ASTRO criteria (p=0.10). Of 164 pairs, the 12-month continence rate was similar 94.1% vs. 95.1% (p=0.803). Of 139 pairs, the 12-month rate of successful intercourse was 29.5% for whole - gland and 46.8% for partial ablation (OR 2.1, p=0.003). The incidence of post-treatment urinary retention was 6.0% and 6.6% (p=0.88) following whole - gland and partial ablation respectively and that of rectourethral fistula was 1.2% and 0% (p=0.50) Conclusion: Partial ablation results in better post-treatment sexual function compared to whole - gland ablation in men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer.

The pattern was characterized by relative hypermetabolism in pallidum, putamen, thalamus, brain stem, and cerebellum associated with hypometabolism in sensorimotor cortex, posterior parietal, occipital, and frontal cortices. The expression of PDRP - Slovenia discriminated PD patients from NCs (p < 0.0001) and correlated positively with patients ' clinical score (MDS-UPDRS-III, p = 0.03). Additionally, its topography agrees well with the original PDRP (p < 0.001) identified in American cohort of PD patients. We validated the PDRP - Slovenia expression on additional FDG-PET scans of 20 PD patients, 20 NCs, and 25 patients with atypical parkinsonism (AP). We confirmed that the expression of PDRP - Slovenia manifests good diagnostic accuracy with specificity and sensitivity of 85-90% at optimal pattern expression cutoff for discrimination of PD patients and NCs and is not expressed in AP.

Surgical site infection (SSI) following spine surgery is a morbid and expensive complication. The use of intrawound vancomycin is emerging as a solution to reduce SSI. The development of vancomycin-resistant pathogens is an understandable concern. To determine the occurrence of vancomycin-resistant SSI in patients with and without use of intrawound vancomycin. Patients undergoing elective spine surgery were dichotomized based on whether intrawound vancomycin was applied. Outcome was occurrence of SSI requiring return to the operating room within postoperative 90 days. The intrawound culture and vancomycin minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were reviewed. Analyses were conducted to compare the pathogen profile and MIC for vancomycin in patients who received vancomycin and those who did not. Of the total 2802 patients, 43% (n = 1215) had intrawound vancomycin application during the index surgery. The use of vancomycin was associated with significantly lower deep SSI rates (1.6% [n = 20] vs 2.5% [n = 40], P = .02). The occurrence of Staphylococcus aureus SSI was significantly lower in the patients who had application of intrawound vancomycin (32% vs 65%, P = .003). None of the patients who had application of intrawound vancomycin powder, and subsequently developed an S aureus SSI, demonstrated pathogens with resistance to vancomycin. All patients had MIC < 2 \u03bcg/mL, the vancomycin susceptibility threshold. The occurrence of gram-negative SSI (28% vs 7%) and culture negative fluid collection (16% vs 5%) was higher in the vancomycin cohort. The use of intrawound vancomycin during the index spine surgery was protective against SSI following spine surgery.

Cell counts and cytological features were evaluated in all initially nondiagnostic (ND) cases. ND cases were reclassified into TBS categories by 2 pathologists, and the results were compared with surgical outcomes. One hundred forty-six of the 151 cases initially classified as ND were available for review, and they had a mean cell count of 60.5 (standard deviation, 71.4). Interobserver agreement on the reclassification of ND cases was moderate (k = 0.57), and consensus yielded 48 ND cases (33%), 72 benign cases (49%), 24 cases of atypia of undetermined significance (16%), and 2 cases suspicious for malignancy (1%). Lowering the diagnostic threshold to any follicular cells yielded a sensitivity of 92%, a specificity of 60%, a positive predictive value of 59%, a negative predictive value of 92%, and a false-negative rate of 7.7%, whereas the values for the initially diagnostic cases were 93%, 58%, 59%, 93%, and 7.7%, respectively.

Due to the very short residence times at high temperatures during such measurements, thermal decomposition of silk protein can be significantly suppressed. FSC was performed at 2000K/s using the Mettler Flash DSC1 on fibroin films with masses around 130-270ng. Films were prepared with different crystalline fractions (ranging from 0.26 to 0.50) and with different crystal structures (Silk I, Silk II, or mixed) by varying the processing conditions. These included water annealing at different temperatures, exposure to 50% MeOH in water, or autoclaving. The resulting crystal structure was examined using wide angle X-ray scattering. Degree of crystallinity was evaluated from Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and from analysis of the heat capacity increment at the glass transition temperature. Silk fibroin films prepared by water annealing at 25\u00b0C were the least crystalline and had Silk I structure. FTIR and FSC studies showed that films prepared by autoclaving or 50% MeOH exposure were the most crystalline and had Silk II structure. Intermediate crystalline fraction and mixed Silk I / Silk II structure s were found in films prepared by water annealing at 37\u00b0C. FSC results indicate that Silk I I crystals exhibit endotherms of narrower width and have higher mean melting temperature Tm(II)=351\u00b12.6\u00b0C, compared to Silk I crystals which melt at Tm(I)=292\u00b13.8\u00b0C. Films containing mixed Silk I / Silk II structure showed two clearly separated endothermic peaks. Evidence suggests that the two types of crystal s melt separately and do not thermal ly interconvert on the extremely short time scale (0.065s between onset and end of melting) of the FSC experiment. Silkworm silk is a naturally occurring biomaterial. The fibroin component of silk forms two types of crystals. Silk properties depend upon the amount and type of crystals, and their stability. One measure of stability is crystal melting temperature. Crystal s which are more stable have a higher melting temperature. Until now, it has been challenging to study thermal behavior of silk crystal s because they degrade at high temperature. To avoid degradation, and study the melting properties of silk biomaterial, we heated silk at a very fast rate of 2000K/s using a special calorimeter. We have shown that the two crystal types have very different melting temperature s, indicating that one crystal type is much more stable than the other."}

In the present study we report on the effect of leonurine on ICR mice with adenomyosis induced by neonatal tamoxifen. MATERIAL AND METHODS After being treated with tamoxifen for 4, 8, and 12 weeks, we assessed body weight and pain modulation in mice in hotplate tests. The mice were divided into 5 groups: a low-dose leonurine treatment group, a high-dose leonurine treatment group, a valproic acid (VPA) treatment group, a vehicle only treatment group, and a blank control group. We evaluated body weight, pain modulation in hotplate tests, and the depth of myometrial infiltration. Immunoreactivity staining of progesterone receptor (PR), nuclear factor-\u03baB phosphorylated-p65 (p-p65), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and oxytocin receptor (OTR) was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS The measurement of the body weight, myometrial infiltration, and pain modulation showed that neonatal tamoxifen treatment led to adenomyosis. Leonurine treatment appeared to decrease hyperalgesia and myometrial infiltration. Immunoreactivity staining showed decreased p-p65, COX-2, and OTR protein expressions. CONCLUSIONS Our results indicate that leonurine attenuates hyperalgesia in mice with induced adenomyosis via down-regulating expressions of p-P65, COX-2, and OTR, and could be beneficial for treating adenomyosis."}

Accounting for linkage disequilibrium in genome scans increases detection power, but haplotype -based methods require individual genotypes and are not applicable on pool-sequenced samples. We propose to take advantage of the local score approach to account for linkage disequilibrium in genome scans for selection, cumulating (possibly small) signals from single markers over a genomic segment, to clearly pinpoint a selection signal. Using computer simulations, we demonstrate that this approach detects selection with higher power than several state-of-the-art single-marker, windowing or haplotype -based approaches. We illustrate this on two benchmark data sets including individual genotypes, for which we obtain similar results with the local score and one haplotype -based approach. Finally, we apply the local score approach to Pool-Seq data obtained from a divergent selection experiment on behaviour in quail and obtain precise and biologically coherent selection signals: while competing methods fail to highlight any clear selection signature, our method detects several regions involving genes known to act on social responsiveness or autistic traits. Although we focus here on the detection of positive selection from multiple population data, the local score approach is general and can be applied to other genome scans for selection or other genomewide analyses such as GWAS."}

Methods: A single- center, retrospective cohort study to determine incidence and diagnostic accuracy for Type 2 DN as the primary cause of ESRD (Code 250.40) on the Center for Medicare & Medicaid (CMS) Medical Evidence Report form (CMS2728) submitted at renal replacement therapy initiation. All patients \u226518 years of age with a CMS2728 submitted between 1 March 2006 and 31 March 2015 at a single academic military medical center (ESRD Network 5) were included. Medical records of those with a Code 250.40 diagnosis were reviewed to determine whether they met the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) 2007 criteria for DN. Results: ESRD incidence secondary to Type 2 DN was 18.7% (56/299 individual CMS2728 submissions over 9.09 years). In all, 12/56 (21.4%) did not meet KDOQI criteria for Type 2 DN. Although all had diabetes, those not meeting criteria had shorter disease duration (P = 0.007), were more likely to have active urine sediment (P = 0.006), and were less likely to have macroalbuminuria (P = 0.037) or retinopathy (P = 0.002) prior to ESRD. On exact logistic regression, retinopathy was significantly associated with KDOQI -predicted DN [odds ratio = 19.16 (confidence interval 2.76-223.7), P = 0.0009]. Conclusions: In this single- center cohort, 21.4% identified as having Type 2 DN as the primary cause of ESRD were incorrectly assigned per KDOQI 2007 clinical criteria.

Efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs) which block the efflux of antibiotics synergize antibiotics, but the clinical development of EPI / antibiotic combination therapy to treat multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative infections has been challenging. This is in part caused by the inefficiency of current EPIs to penetrate the outer membrane and resist efflux. We demonstrate that conjugation of a tobramycin (TOB) vector to EPIs like NMP, paroxetine, or DBP enhances synergy and efficacy of EPIs in combination with tetracycline antibiotics against MDR Gram-negative bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Besides potentiating tetracycline antibiotics, TOB - EPI conjugates can also suppress resistance development to the tetracycline antibiotic minocycline, thereby providing a strategy to develop more effective adjuvants to rescue tetracycline antibiotics from resistance in MDR Gram-negative bacteria."}

Psychiatric disorders were assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, conducted by trained psychologists. A trained sociologist used an ad hoc interview to collect information about childhood experiences, including parenting, trauma, education and substance misuse.

Substance use disorders were less frequent among young offenders who were serving their sentence in young offenders' institutions than among those serving in community centres and more frequent among those who started to use marijuana at an earlier age. Among other variables, childhood maltreatment was related to major depressive disorder, and maternal death to anxiety disorders. Higher educational status was related to a lower frequency of depressive and anxiety disorders.

Eligible participants had to be aged \u226560 years, and engaged in water-based exercise (n = 38) or a combination of water - and land-based exercise (n = 39) for at least 80% of their total exercise time for over 5 years at our fitness center. In statistical analysis, a two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance was carried out to examine the effects over time and by exercise type, and the changes in each parameter over 5 years were also compared between the two groups. We found significant main effects and an interaction between time and exercise type for gait speed, with an early decline in the combined exercise group, as well as significant main effects of time, showing a functional decline in grip strength, one-leg standing time and step/height ratio in both exercise types at the 5- year follow up. The 5- year changes in each parameter did not differ between the two groups despite the frequency of exercise, even though we found a negative correlation between changes in one-leg standing time and total amount of water-based exercise. Contrary to expectations, these results suggest that regular engagement in water-based exercise, even combined with land-based exercise, might have poor long-term benefits for maintaining physical performance in older adults.

In this study, we investigate the association between LBP and these exposures among 102 professional drivers. The combined exposures of WBV and posture are measured at different workplaces. Health and personal data as well as information about lifting tasks are collected by a questionnaire. The daily vibration exposure value (odds ratio 1.69) and an index for awkward posture (odds ratio 1.63) show significant association with the occurence of LBP. Awkward posture and heavy lifting appear to be more strongly associated with sick leave than WBV exposure. Furthermore, a combination of the measurement results of WBV and awkward posture into one quantity also shows significant correlation to LBP. The combined exposure of WBV and awkward posture can be described in terms of the daily vibration exposure and the index for awkward posture. This facilitates work place assessments and future research in this area. Practitioner Summary: For the first time, quantitative measures combining whole-body vibration and awkward posture exposures have shown to correlate with the occurrence of low back pain significantly. This validates the proposed quantities and measurement methods, which facilitate workplace assessments and assist in the design of further studies which are necessary to establish a causal exposure - response relationship."}

A total of 923 adult patients with chronic heart failure and 1020 age - and gender -matched healthy controls were recruited. CKIP-1 rs2306235 polymorphism was genotyped using PCR - restriction fragment length polymorphism. Additional follow-up data for 140 chronic heart failure patients was evaluated. The rs2306235 G allele was associated with an increased risk of chronic heart failure (OR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.09-1.75, p = 0.007), especially in patients with hypertension (OR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.09-1.75, p = 0.006) and coronary heart disease (OR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.09-1.83, p = 0.010) after adjustment for multiple cardiovascular risk factors. However, rs2306235 polymorphism was not associated with cardiovascular mortality in chronic heart failure (p = 0.875).

Phenological responses to climate linking these stages may ultimately impact fitness. We analyzed five decades of banding data from 17 migratory bird species to investigate 1) how spring arrival related to timing of breeding, 2) if the interval between arrival and breeding has changed with increasing spring temperatures, and 3) whether arrival timing or breeding timing best predicted local productivity. Four of 17 species, all mid- to long-distance migrants, hatched young earlier in years when migrants arrived earlier to the breeding grounds (~1:1 day advancement). The interval between arrival on breeding grounds and appearance of juveniles shortened with warmer spring temperatures for 12 species (1-6 days for every 1\u00b0C increase) and over time for seven species (1-8 days per decade), suggesting that some migratory passerines adapt to climate change by laying more quickly after arrival or reducing the time from laying to fledging. We found more support for the former, that the rate of reproductive advancement was higher than that for arrival in warm years. Timing of spring arrival and breeding were both poor predictors of avian productivity for most migrants analyzed. Nevertheless, we found evidence that fitness benefits may occur from shifts to earlier spring arrival for the multi-brooded Song Sparrow. Our results uniquely demonstrate that co-occurring avian species are phenologically plastic in their response to climate change on their breeding grounds. If migrants continue to show a weaker response to temperatures during migration than breeding, and the window between arrival and optimal breeding shortens further, biological constraints to plasticity may limit the ability of species to adapt successfully to future warming."}

Fish ectoparasites make initial contact with their hosts at body surfaces, such as skin and gills, which are covered with mucosa that are similar to those of mammalian guts. Fish are among the most primitive vertebrates with immune systems that are equivalent to those in mammals, and they produce and secrete IgM into mucus. In this study, we showed that the monogenean parasite Heterobothrium okamotoi utilizes IgM to recognize its host, fugu Takifugu rubripes Oncomiracidia are infective larvae of H. okamotoi that shed their cilia and metamorphose into juveniles when exposed to purified d-mannose - binding fractions from fugu mucus. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, proteins contained in the fraction were identified as d-mannose -specific IgM with two d-mannose -binding lectins. However, although deciliation was significantly induced by IgM and was inhibited by d-mannose or a specific Ab against fugu IgM, other lectins had no effect, and IgM without d-mannose affinity induced deciliation to a limited degree. Subsequent immunofluorescent staining experiments showed that fugu d-mannose -specific IgM binds ciliated epidermal cells of oncomiracidium. These observations suggest that deciliation is triggered by binding of fugu IgM to cell surface Ags via Ag binding sites. Moreover, concentrations of d-mannose - binding IgM in gill mucus were sufficient to induce deciliation in vitro, indicating that H. okamotoi parasites initially use host Abs to colonize host gills."}

To date, there is no prophylactic vaccine against KSHV. KSHV gpK8.1, gB, and gH / gL glycoproteins, implicated in the virus entry into host cells, are attractive vaccine targets for eliciting potent neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against virus infection. We incorporated gpK8.1, gB, or gH / gL on the surface of virus-like particles (VLPs) and characterized these VLPs for their composition, size, and functionality. To determine which viral glycoprotein(s) elicit the most effective serum - nAbs, we immunized BALB/c mice with gpK8.1, gB, or gH / gL VLPs individually or in combination. Neutralizing antibody assay revealed that sera from mice immunized with the VLPs inhibited KSHV infection of HEK-293 cells in a dose-dependent manner. As a single immunogen, gpK8.1 VLPs stimulated comparable nAb activity to that of UV - inactivated KSHV (UV-KSHV). In contrast, UV-KSHV stimulated higher titers of nAb compared to gB (p = 0.0316) or gH / gL (p = 0.0486). Mice immunized with the combination of gB and gH / gL VLPs had a better nAb response than those immunized with either gB (p = 0.0268), or gH /gL (p = 0.0397) as single VLP immunogens. Immunization with any VLP combination stimulated comparable nAb activity to UV-KSHV serum. Our data provide the first evidence that KSHV gpK8.1, gB, and gH / gL glycoproteins can be incorporated onto the surface of VLPs and used as prophylactic vaccine candidates, with potential to prevent KSHV infection."}

A recent genome-wide association study revealed that a missense variant, rs373863828-A (p.Arg457Gln), of the CREBRF gene (encoding CREB3 regulatory factor) was associated with an excessive increase in body mass index (BMI) in Samoans. In the present study, the association of rs373863828-A with an increase in BMI was examined in four Austronesian (AN)- speaking populations in Oceania. We found that rs373863828-A was frequently observed (frequency of 0.15) in Tongans (Polynesians), and was strongly associated with higher BMI (P=6.1 \u00d7 10(-4)). A single copy of the rs373863828-A allele increased BMI by 3.09 kg m(-2) after adjustment of age and sex. No significant association was detected in the other three AN - speaking populations (Melanesians and Micronesians) living in Solomon Islands. This was probably due to the low allele frequency (0.02-0.06) of rs373863828-A as well as small sample size. The rs373863828-A allele was not found in both AN - speaking and non- AN - speaking Melanesians living in Papua New Guinea.

The present study aimed to assess the efficacy of a recently developed MLV vaccine (Ingelvac PRRSFLEX\u00ae EU) in piglets at 2 and 3-weeks of age in the presence of homologous maternally derived antibodies as the dams were vaccinated with the same vaccine strain (ReproCyc\u00ae PRRS EU). The study was carried out on a Hungarian farrow to finish farm naturally infected with PRRSv. The study was designed as a blind, placebo controlled side by side trial. ORF5 sequence similarity of the vaccine strain and the resident field strain was 87.8 %. PRRS specific real-time quantitative PCR was performed from serum samples to measure both the viral load and the frequency of virus positive animals. At the time of the natural infection observed in the control group at 10-12 weeks of age, the number of viraemic animals did not increase significantly in the vaccinated group. To understand the infection dynamics, positive PCR samples with low Ct values were sequenced (ORF5) and the data analysis indicated the circulation of wild type virus in both groups, however wild type virus was only found in non-vaccinated animals. Our data indicate that piglets vaccinated at as early as 2 weeks of age with Ingelvac PRRSFLEX\u00ae EU were protected both in terms of proportion of viraemic animals and viraemia levels. It has to be highlighted that these results were achieved in piglets with high levels of homologous maternally derived antibodies (MDA) at the time of vaccination."}

Two distinct PPT design variants (open vs. occluded drug application) are commonly used, but no previous work has aimed to directly compare and contrast their performance. We compared the antipsoriatic efficacy of mapracorat 0.1% ointment and reference drugs reported in 2 separate studies, representing open and occluded PPT designs. The drug effect size was measured by sonography (mean change in echo-poor band thickness), chromametry, and standardized clinical assessment. Antipsoriatic effects were detectable for the study drugs in both occluded and open PPTs. Differences between the potency of antipsoriatic drugs and vehicle were observable. The total antipsoriatic effect size appeared to be higher in the occluded PPT than the open PPT, despite the shorter treatment duration (2 vs. 4 weeks). Effect dynamics over time revealed greater differences between some study drugs in the open PPT compared to the occluded PPT. Taking the higher technical challenges for the open PPT into account, we recommend the occluded PPT as a standard screening setting in early drug development. In special cases, considering certain drug aspects or study objectives that would require procedural adaptations, an open PPT could be the better-suited design. Finally, both PPT models show clear advantages: classification as phase I studies, small number of psoriatic subjects, relatively short study duration, excellent discrimination between compounds and concentrations, parallel measurement of treatment response, and go/no go decisions very early in clinical development."}

We analyzed factors associated with insurance coverage and utilization among patients presenting for STD services between July and December 2015. A total of 692 patients had insurance information available; of those, 40% were uninsured. Patients without insurance were more likely than those with insurance to be nonwhite (50% among uninsured, compared with 40% among insured; P = 0.014) and Hispanic or Latino/a (25%, compared with 16%; P = 0.006), and less likely to be men who have sex with men (27%, compared with 39%; P = 0.001). Of those with health insurance, 26% obtained coverage as a result of the Affordable Care Act, and 56% of those were previously uninsured. Among uninsured individuals, barriers to obtaining health insurance included cost and unemployment. Among those with insurance, 43% reported willingness to use insurance for STD services. Barriers to insurance use included concerns about anonymity and out-of-pocket costs. Despite expanded insurance access, many individuals presenting to the Rhode Island STD Clinic were uninsured.

No consensus has been established, however, that defines an effective treatment strategy and clarifies the pathogenesis. In this study, 517 patients with early syphilis were enrolled and treated. Twelve months after treatment, 79.3% (410/517) of patients achieved serological cure, 20.1% (104/517) were serofast, and 0.6% (3/517) were serological failures. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that older age (>40 years) and lower baseline RPR titer (\u2264 1:8) were associated with serofast status. We also identified 21 T. pallidum molecular subtypes among early syphilis patients and detected a new subtype, 14i/a. We found that the proportion of 14i/a type in serofast patients was significantly higher than that in patients with serological cure, predicting an increasing risk of serofast status. Levels of chemerin were higher in the serum of serofast cases than serological cure cases, potentially indicating a novel cytokine marker for serofast in early syphilis patients after therapy. We hope that these results contribute to improve guidelines for the management of syphilis patients who experience serofast."}

GSCs are therefore a promising target for GBM treatment. Our group identified the cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) and its partner, the co-chaperone Hsp70 / 90 organizing protein (HOP), as potential target candidates due to their role in GBM tumorigenesis and in neural stem cell maintenance. GSCs expressing different levels of PrP(C) were cultured as neurospheres with growth factors, and characterized with stem cells markers and adhesion molecules markers through immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. We than evaluated GSC self-renewal and proliferation by clonal density assays and BrdU incorporation, respectively, in front of recombinant HOP treatment, combined or not with a HOP peptide which mimics the PrP(C) binding site. Stable silencing of HOP was also performed in parental and/or PrP(C) -depleted cell populations, and proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo were evaluated. Migration assays were performed on laminin-1 pre-coated glass. We observed that, when GBM cells are cultured as neurospheres, they express specific stemness markers such as CD133, CD15, Oct4, and SOX2; PrP(C) is upregulated compared to monolayer culture and co-localizes with CD133. PrP(C) silencing downregulates the expression of molecules associated with cancer stem cells, upregulates markers of cell differentiation and affects GSC self-renewal, pointing to a pivotal role for PrP(C) in the maintenance of GSCs. Exogenous HOP treatment increases proliferation and self-renewal of GSCs in a PrP(C) -dependent manner while HOP knockdown disturbs the proliferation process. In vivo, PrP(C) and/or HOP knockdown potently inhibits the growth of subcutaneously implanted glioblastoma cells. In addition, disruption of the PrP(C) - HOP complex by a HOP peptide, which mimics the PrP(C) binding site, affects GSC self-renewal and proliferation indicating that the HOP - PrP(C) complex is required for GSC stemness. Furthermore, PrP(C) -depleted GSCs downregulate cell adhesion-related proteins and impair cell migration indicating a putative role for PrP(C) in the cell surface stability of cell adhesion molecules and GBM cell invasiveness, respectively. In conclusion, our results show that the modulation of HOP - PrP(C) engagement or the decrease of PrP(C) and HOP expression may represent a potential therapeutic intervention in GBM, regulating glioblastoma stem-like cell self-renewal, proliferation, and migration."}

However, its precise clinical role in the neural crest cell tumors continues to evolve. The purpose of this study was to compare iodine-131 metaiodobenzylguanidine ((131)I-MIBG) and FDG-PET of head to head in patients with neural crest tumors both qualitatively and semiquantitatively and to determine their clinical utility in disease status evaluation and further management. A total of 32 patients who had undergone (131)I-MIBG and FDG-PET prospectively were evaluated and clinicopathologically grouped into three categories: neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma, and medullary carcinoma thyroid. In 18 patients of neuroblastoma, FDG PET and (131)I-MIBG showed patient-specific sensitivity of 84% and 72%, respectively. The mean maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of primary lesions in patients with unfavorable histology was found to be relatively higher than those with favorable histology (5.18 \u00b1 2.38 vs. 3.21 \u00b1 1.69). The mean SUVmax of two common sites (posterior superior iliac spine [PSIS] and greater trochanter) was higher in patients with involved marrow than those with uninvolved one (2.36 and 2.75 vs. 1.26 and 1.34, respectively). The ratio of SUVmax of the involved/ contralateral normal sites was 2.16 \u00b1 1.9. In equivocal bone marrow results, the uptake pattern with SUV estimation can depict metastatic involvement and help in redirecting the biopsy site. Among seven patients of pheochromocytoma, FDG-PET revealed 100% patient-specific sensitivity. FDG-PET detected more metastatic foci than (131)I-MIBG (18 vs. 13 sites). In seven patients of medullary carcinoma thyroid, FDG-PET localized residual, recurrent, or metastatic disease with much higher sensitivity (32 metastatic foci with 72% patient specific sensitivity) than (131)I-MIBG, trending along the higher serum calcitonin levels.

The study population consisted of Australians aged 20 years or older in 2010, whose health and other relevant outcomes were modelled over their remaining lifetime. The SSBs tax was estimated to reduce the number of people with obesity by 1.96% of the entire population (437,000 fewer persons with obesity), and reduce the number of employees with obesity by 317,000 persons. These effects translated into productivity gains in the paid sector of AU$751 million for the working - age population (95% confidence interval: AU$565 million to AU$954 million), using the human capital approach. In the unpaid sector, the potential productivity gains amounted to AU$1172 million (AU$929 million to AU$1435 million) using the replacement cost method. These productivity benefits are in addition to the health benefits of 35,000 life years gained and a reduction in healthcare costs of AU$425 million.

It is therefore valuable to understand which (contextual) factors promote or hinder working memory performance. Recent research shows positive associations between positive parent-child and teacher-student interactions and working memory performance and development. However, no study has yet experimentally investigated how parents and teachers affect working memory performance. Based on attachment theory, the current study investigated the role of parent and teacher emotional support in promoting working memory performance by buffering the negative effect of social stress. Questionnaires and an experimental session were completed by 170 children from grade 1 to 2 (Mage = 7 years 6 months, SD = 7 months). Questionnaires were used to assess children's perceptions of the teacher-student and parent-child relationship. During an experimental session, working memory was measured with the Corsi task backward (Milner, 1971) in a pre- and post-test design. In-between the tests stress was induced in the children using the Cyberball paradigm (Williams et al., 2000). Emotional support was manipulated (between-subjects) through an audio message (either a weather report, a supportive message of a stranger, a supportive message of a parent, or a supportive message of a teacher). Results of repeated measures ANOVA showed no clear effect of the stress induction. Nevertheless, an effect of parent and teacher support was found and depended on the quality of the parent-child relationship. When children had a positive relationship with their parent, support of parents and teachers had little effect on working memory performance. When children had a negative relationship with their parent, a supportive message of that parent decreased working memory performance, while a supportive message from the teacher increased performance. In sum, the current study suggests that parents and teachers can support working memory performance by being supportive for the child. Teacher support is most effective when the child has a negative relationship with the parent. These insights can give direction to specific measures aimed at preventing and resolving working memory problems and related issues."}

Use of antiarrhythmic drugs in cases of maternal tachyarrhythmia must give due consideration of potential teratogenic side effects. Utilization of antiarrhythmic drugs during pregnancy has been well studied; some result in minimal fetal harm or none at all. New techniques, such as cardiac ablation, have also been implemented with minimal or no radiation exposure to the fetus or mother. Pregnant women with tachyarrhythmia have been successfully treated with little to no impact on the developing fetus as result of increasing experience with antiarrhythmic drugs and progress of new procedural techniques."}

This study was aimed to investigate whether modification of BMSCs with hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (Hif-1\u03b1) could enhance the survival of the implanted BMSCs. BMSCs were isolated from Wistar rats, and were infected with Hif-1\u03b1-GFP lentiviral vector or Hif-1\u03b1 siRNA. The modified BMSCs were exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) condition, cellular viability and apoptosis were then assessed. An inhibitor of AMPK (compound C) was used to detect whether AMPK and mTOR were implicated in the functions of Hif-1\u03b1 on BMSCs survival. Besides, ultrastructure of BMSCs was observed and the expression of autophagy markers was measured. The modified BMSCs were transplanted into middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of rats, and the cerebral infarction volume and neurological function was assessed. The results indicated that Hif-1\u03b1 overexpression protected OGD induced injury by promoting cellular viability and inhibiting apoptosis. AMPK was activated while mTOR was inactivated by Hif-1\u03b1 overexpression, and that might be through which Hif-1\u03b1 functioned BMSCs survival. Hif-1\u03b1 overexpression promoted autophagy; more important, compound C abolished the induction of Hif-1\u03b1 on autophagy. Transplantation of the overexpressed Hif-1\u03b1 of BMSCs into the MCAO rats reduced brain infarct volume and improved neurobehavioral outcome; besides, it inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokines generation while promoted neurotrophin secretion. In conclusion, Hif-1\u03b1 might be contributed in the survival of BMSCs by regulating the activation of AMPK and mTOR, as well as by promoting autophagy."}

Teens and parents completed validated measures of treatment adherence, diabetes -specific self-efficacy, quality of life, and diabetes -specific family conflict. Parent-youth interview and chart review provided demographics and diabetes management data. Mean number of events / teen was 2.6 \u00b1 2.7 (range = 0-15). The most common events were \" Hospitalization of a family member \" (24%), \" Getting a bad report card \" (20%), \"Serious arguments between parents \" (19%), and \" Serious illness / injury in a family member \" (19%). Compared with teens experiencing 0 to 1 event, teens experiencing 4+ events were less likely to have married parents (P = .01) and a parent with a college degree (P = .006). Teen s with 4+ events had significantly poorer adherence (P = .002 teen, P = .02 parent), lower self-efficacy (P = .03 teen, P < .0001 parent), poorer quality of life (P < .0001 teen, P < .0001 parent), and more conflict (P = .006 teen, P = .02 parent) than teens with fewer events. In a multivariate model (R (2) = 0.21, P < .0001) controlling for demographic and diabetes management characteristics, fewer events was associated with lower A1c (P = .0009).

Omics technologies such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics coupled with statistical and bioinformatics tools have already shown great potential in this research field even if so far only few biomarkers have been validated. For the past two decades, important analytical techniques have been developed to detect as many metabolites as possible in human biofluids such as urine, blood, and saliva. In the field of food science and nutrition, many studies have been carried out for food authenticity, quality, and safety, as well as for food processing. Furthermore, metabolomic investigations have been carried out to discover new early biomarkers of metabolic dysfunction and predictive biomarkers of developing pathologies (obesity, metabolic syndrome, type-2 diabetes, etc.).

While attempts have been made to study cellulose metabolism through the use of knock-out mutants, there have been no systematic effort to characterize natural variation for cellulose metabolism in ecotypes adapted to different habitats. Here, we characterized natural variation in saccharification of cellulose and fermentation in 73 ecotypes and 89 laboratory strains of the model fungus Neurospora crassa. We observed significant variation in both traits among natural and laboratory generated populations, with some elite strains performing better than the reference strain. In the F1 population N345, 15% of the population outperformed both parents with the top performing strain having 10% improvement in ethanol production. These results suggest that natural alleles can be exploited through fungal breeding for developing elite industrial strains for bioethanol production."}

Experiments were carried out on Male Sprague-Dawley rats that were split into four groups at random: TBI - fracture group, fracture - only group, TBI - only group, and control group. In the first week, blood specimen would be drawn from rats among the groups except those of the control group at three-time points (24, 72 and 168 hours) post - damage. These rats would be assessed from the neurological perspective based on their grades of performance in a sequence of tests 24 hours before and 12 hours after brain injury. Blood samples were also taken from the control group 24 hours before the injury, and whole brain tissues in the injured groups were harvested at 72 and 168 hours post - injury. We compared the serum CGRP concentration, the distribution of CGRP, the CGRP expression, and the expression of CGRP in the hippocampus, the expression of CGRP in the hippocampus, the expression of CGRP in the hippocampus, and the expression of CGRP in the brain by immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, RT - Of CGRP RNA expression levels. Neurological examinations suggested that the functions of the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and brain stem showed significant differences pre - and post - injury (p < 0.001). ELISA analysis indicated a great density of CGRP in TBI - fracture group at different time points. Furthermore, in the TBI - fracture group, CGRP in both hippocampus and the whole brain showed a noticeable augment in RT-PCR and western blot analysis at 72 and 168 h post - injury, and only in this group, immunohistochemistry analysis indicated that CGRP was present in the hippocampus at 168 hours post - injury. We observed that the hippocampus and CGRP were responsible for quick bone-healing mechanisms. We suggest a role for the hippocampus in accelerated fracture healing. CGRP expression, as determined by IHC, cannot be observed in other groups, indicating that the hippocampus may be the specific component of the brain that responds to \" big stress \"."}

We focused our attention on the rate of the first PSA increase and on the influence of prostatic inflammation. From 2011 to 2016, 365 men with a previous negative prostate biopsy and persistent elevated PSA levels received dutasteride treatment. The population was followed for a range of 12-48 months. One hundred twelve cases with a confirmed PSA increase >0.5 ng/ml over the nadir value during the follow-up were included in Group A and underwent a new prostate biopsy. In Group A, the PSA increase was associated with PC at the re-biopsy in 66% of cases. The percentage of PSA reduction after 6 months of treatment was not a significant indicator of the risk for PC. The distribution of inflammatory infiltrates significantly (p<00.01) varied from positive to negative prostate biopsies. The relative risk for PC at biopsy significantly increase d according to PSA level during dutasteride. Treatment with dutasteride can help to analyze PSA kinetic.

A 63-year-old man with a repaired MMC presented with a progressive gait disturbance and numbness in both lower limbs. Magnetic resonance images demonstrated that the tethered spinal cord was compressed by severe canal stenosis along the entire lumbar spine. After a multi-level lumbar decompression surgery, the patient recovered to baseline neurological status. In adults with a repaired MMC, lumbar canal stenosis should be investigated as a possible cause of late neurological decline. Clinical manifestations may be complicated by the coexistence of both the original and subsequent neurological disorders.

In ADCC assays, target cells bound by the antibodies are lysed by activated effector cells following interactions between the Fc region of the bound antibody and Fc\u03b3 receptors on effector cells. Target cell lysis is typically measured by quantification of released endogenous enzymes, e.g., lactate dehydrogenase, or measurement of released exogenous labels, e.g., (51)Cr, europium or calcein. ADCC assays based on the detection of exogenous labels released from lysed target cells generally show higher sensitivity and require shorter incubation times. However, target cells are usually labeled immediately prior to assay, which inadvertently introduces additional assay variations due to differences in target cell conditions and labeling / handling processes. In this report, we describe the use of thaw -and-use pre-labeled target cells for ADCC assays. Thaw -and-use target cells in our experiments were pre-labeled with the fluorescent dye calcein AM, cryopreserved in single-use aliquots and used directly in assays after thawing. Upon thaw, the pre-labeled cells displayed viability and label retention comparable to freshly labeled cells, responded to ADCC mediated by both peripheral blood mononuclear cells and engineered natural killer cells, performed stably for at least 3 years and provided favorable precision and accuracy to ADCC assays. Implementation of thaw -and-use pre-labeled target cells in ADCC assays can help to alleviate both cell culture and dye labeling derived variability, increase the flexibility of assay scheduling and improve assay consistency and robustness."}

Multibacillary lesions are composed largely of infected epithelioid macrophages and paucibacillary lesions contain T cells but few bacteria. Multibacillary disease is similar to human lepromatous leprosy, with variable/high levels of antibody and a dysfunctional immune response. Animals with paucibacillary disease have high cell-mediated immunity and variable levels of antibody. This study aims to characterize the immunological dysfunction using TruSeq analysis of the ileocaecal lymph node that drains disease lesions. Immune dysfunction is highlighted by repression of TCR / CD3 genes, T cell co-receptors / co-stimulators, T cell activation and signal-transduction genes. Inflammation was an acute phase response and chronic inflammation, with little evidence of acute inflammation. The high levels of immunoglobulin and plasma cell transcripts is consistent with the anti-MAP antibody responses in paratuberculosis sheep. Also notable was the overwhelming reduction in mast cell transcripts, potentially affecting DC activation of the immune response. This study also shows that there were no fundamental differences in the gene expression patterns in multibacillary and paucibacillary disease, no shift in T cell genes from Th1 to Th2 pattern but rather an incremental decline into immune dysfunction leading to multibacillary pathology."}

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common side effect in the context of various medical procedures, and RIC has been suggested as a means of reducing its incidence. Outcomes regarding kidney function have been reported in numerous studies that evaluated the effects of RIC in a variety of settings (eg, cardiac surgery, interventions requiring intravenous administration of contrast media). Although several individual studies have implied a beneficial effect of RIC in preserving kidney function, 3 recently published randomized controlled trials evaluating more than 1000 patients each (Effect of Remote Ischemic Preconditioning in the Cardiac Surgery, Remote Ischaemic Preconditioning for Heart Surgery, and E RIC CA) were negative. However, AKI or any other index of renal function was not a stand-alone primary end point in any of these trials. On the other hand, a range of meta-analyses (each including thousands of participants) have reported mixed results, with the most recent among them showing benefit from RIC, pinpointing at the same time a number of shortcomings in published studies, adversely affecting the quality of available data. The present review provides a critical appraisal of the current state of this field of research. It is the opinion of the authors of this review that there is a clear need for a common clinical trial framework for ischemic conditioning studies. If the current babel of definitions, procedures, outcomes, and goals persists, it is most likely that soon ischemic conditioning will be \"yesterday's news\" with no definitive conclusions having been reached in terms of its real clinical utility."}

In this study, we used avirulent wild type and virulent mutant isolates of Puccinia striiformis to characterize the interactions in wheat carrying yellow rust Yr2 resistance. Both conventional and advanced microscopic techniques were used for a detailed study of morphology and growth of fungal colonies and associated host cell responses. The growth of the wild type isolates was highly restricted due to hypersensitive response (HR, plant cell death) indicated by autofluorescence and change in the shape of the affected plant cells. The host response appeared post - haustorial, but large variation in the time and stage of arrest was observed for individual fungal colonies, probably due to a delay between detection and response. Some colonies were stopped right after the formation of the primary infection hyphae whereas others formed highly branched mycelia. HR was first observed in host cells in direct contact with fungal structures, after which the defense responses spread to adjacent host cells, and eventually led to encasement of the fungal colony. Several cells with HR contained haustoria, which were small and underdeveloped, but some cells contained normal sized haustoria without signs of hypersensitivity. The growth of the virulent mutants in the resistant plants was similar to the growth in plants without Yr2 resistance, which is a strong indication that the incompatible phenotype was associated with Yr2. The interaction between P. striiformis and wheat with Yr2 resistance was highly variable in time and space, which demonstrate that histological studies are important for a deeper understanding of host-pathogen interactions and plant defense mechanisms in general."}

This precocious link is initially broad: At 3 and 4 months, vocalizations of both humans and nonhuman primates support categorization. But by 6 months, infants have narrowed the link: Only human vocalizations support object categorization. Here we ask what guides infants as they tune their initially broad link to a more precise one, engaged only by the vocalizations of our species. Across three studies, we use a novel exposure paradigm to examine the effects of experience. We document that merely exposing infants to nonhuman primate vocalizations enables infants to preserve the early - established link between this signal and categorization. In contrast, exposing infants to backward speech - a signal that fails to support categorization at any age - offers no such advantage. Our findings reveal the power of early experience as infants specify which signals, from an initially broad set, they will continue to link to cognition."}

We evaluated 302 expertly validated SADS cases with suitable DNA (median age: 24 years; 65% males) who underwent next-generation sequencing using an extended panel of 77 primary electrical disorder and cardiomyopathy genes. Pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants were classified using American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) consensus guidelines. The yield of combined molecular autopsy and clinical evaluation in 82 surviving families was evaluated. A gene-level rare variant association analysis was conducted in SADS cases versus controls. A clinically actionable pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant was identified in 40 of 302 cases (13%). The main etiologies established were catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and long QT syndrome (17 [6%] and 11 [4%], respectively). Gene-based rare variants association analysis showed enrichment of rare predicted deleterious variants in RYR2 (p = 5 \u00d7 10(-5)). Combining molecular autopsy with clinical evaluation in surviving families increased diagnostic yield from 26% to 39%. Molecular autopsy for electrical disorder and cardiomyopathy genes, using ACMG guidelines for variant classification, identified a modest but realistic yield in SADS.

The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is well suited to studying these mechanisms because many of its transcripts are transported from the mother cell to the budding daughter cell. Here, we investigated the translational control of ASH1 mRNA after transport and localization. We show that although ASH1 transcripts were translated after they reached the bud-tip, some mRNAs were bound by the RNA-binding protein Puf6 and were non-polysomal. We also found that the DEAD-box helicase Dhh1 complexed with the untranslated ASH1 mRNA and Puf6. Loss of Dhh1 affected local translation of ASH1 mRNA and resulted in delocalization of ASH1 transcript in the bud. Forcibly shifting the non-polysomal ASH1 mRNA into polysomes was associated with Dhh1 dissociation. We further demonstrated that Dhh1 is not recruited to ASH1 mRNA co-transcriptionally, suggesting that it could bind to ASH1 mRNA within the cytoplasm. Of note, Dhh1 bound to the 5 UTR of ASH1 mRNA and inhibited its translation in vitro. These results suggest that after localization to the bud tip, a portion of the localized ASH1 mRNA becomes translationally inactive, because of binding of Dhh1 and Puf6 to the 5' and 3' UTRs of ASH1 mRNA."}

Higher numbers of endobacteria were also found in axenic cultures of P. indica that was freshly re-isolated (riPiri) from plant roots, though numbers dropped during repeated axenic re-cultivation. Prolonged treatments of P. indica cultures with various antibiotics could not completely eliminate the bacterium, though the number of detectable endobacteria decreased significantly, resulting in partial-cured P. indica (pcPiri). pcPiri showed reduced growth in axenic cultures and poor sporulation. Consistent with this, pcPiri also showed reduced plant growth promotion and reduced systemic resistanc e against powdery mildew infection as compared with riPiri and lcPiri. These results are consistent with the assumption that the endobacterium R. radiobacter improves P. indica's fitness and thus contributes to the success of the tripartite Sebacinalean symbiosis."}

The answer, after the published data, is still ambiguous without any confirmed and clear scientific answer. DNA is found to be always surrounded with different electric charges, ions, and dipoles. These surrounding charges and electric barrier(s) due to metallic electrodes (as environmental factors (EFs)) play a substantial role when measuring the electrical conductivity through \u03bb-double helix (DNA) molecule suspended between metallic electrodes. We found that strong frequency dependence of AC - complex conductivity comes from the electrical conduction of EFs. This leads to superimposing serious incorrect experimental data to measured ones. At 1 MHz, we carried out a first control experiment on electrical conductivity with and without the presence of DNA molecule. If there are possible electrical conduction due to stray ions and contribution of substrate, we will detected them. This control experiment revealed that there is an important role played by the environmental - charges around DNA molecule and any experiment should consider this role. We have succeeded to measure both electrical conductivity due to EFs (\u03c3 ENV) and electrical conductivity due to DNA molecule (\u03c3 DNA) independently by carrying the measurements at different DNA - lengths and subtracting the data. We carried out measurements as a function of frequency (f) and temperature (T) in the ranges 0.1 Hz < f < 1 MHz and 288 K < T < 343 K. The measured conductivity (\u03c3 MES) portrays a metal -like behavior at high frequencies near 1 MHz. However, we found that \u03c3 DNA was far from this behavior because the conduction due to EFs superimposes \u03c3 DNA, in particular at low frequencies. By measuring the electrical conductivity at different lengths: 40, 60, 80, and 100 nm, we have succeeded not only to separate the electrical conduction of the DNA molecule from all EFs effects that surround the molecule, but also to present accurate values of \u03c3 DNA and the dielectric constant of the molecule \u03b5'DNA as a function of temperature and frequency. Furthermore, in order to explain these data, we present a model describing the electrical conduction through DNA molecule: DNA is a classical semiconductor with charges, dipoles and ions that result in creation of localized energy - states (LESs) in the extended bands and in the energy gap of the DNA molecule. This model explains clearly the mechanism of charge transfer mechanism in the DNA, and it sheds light on why the charge transfer through the DNA can lead to insulating, semiconducting, or metallic behavior on the same time. The model considers charges on DNA, in the extended bands, either could be free to move under electric field or localized in potential wells/hills. Localization of charges in DNA is an intrinsic structural - property of this solitaire molecule. At all temperatures, the expected increase in thermal - induced charge is attributed to the delocalization of holes (or/and electrons) in potential hills (or/and potential wells) which accurately accounts for the total electric and dielectric behavior through DNA molecule. We succeeded to fit the experiment al data to the proposed model with reasonable magnitudes of potential hills/wells that are in the energy range from 0.068 eV."}

One key application is the understanding of genetically heterogeneous and complex diseases where 50-100 different genes may converge to control the same pathways. These disorders cannot be studied using traditional approaches, based on gene-by-gene Sanger sequencing. We have set up an NGS protocol based on a specific selection of DNA regions belonging to about 900 genes of the autophagy-lysosomal (ALP) pathway. We here specify all the technical steps and challenges of our protocol, named LysoPlex. This is based on the Haloplex technology and together with high-coverage sequencing empowers a high and uniform coverage of ALP genes. LysoPlex outplays other NGS applications in sensitivity and specificity, providing an accurate picture of all variations in ALP genes."}

Wild and captive-reared Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) can be exposed to hypoxic conditions during development and continue to experience fluctuating oxygen levels as juveniles and adults. Here, we examine whether developmental hypoxia impacts subsequent hypoxia tolerance and aerobic performance of Atlantic salmon. Individuals at 8\u00b0C were exposed to 50% (hypoxia) or 100% (normoxia) dissolved oxygen (DO) saturation (as percent of air saturation) from fertilization for \u223c100 d (800 degree days) and then raised in normoxic conditions for a further 15 mo. At 18 mo after fertilization, aerobic scope was calculated in normoxia (100% DO) and acute (18 h) hypoxia (50% DO) from the difference between the minimum and maximum oxygen consumption rates ([Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], respectively) at 10\u00b0C. Hypoxia tolerance was determined as the DO at which loss of equilibrium (LOE) occurred in a constantly decreasing DO environment. There was no difference in [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], or aerobic scope between fish raised in hypoxia or normoxia. There was some evidence that hypoxia tolerance was lower (higher DO at LOE) in hypoxia - raised fish compared with those raised in normoxia, but the magnitude of the effect was small (12.52% DO vs. 11.73% DO at LOE). Acute hypoxia significantly reduced aerobic scope by reducing [Formula: see text], while [Formula: see text] remained unchanged. Interestingly, acute hypoxia uncovered individual -level relationships between DO at LOE and [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and aerobic scope. We discuss our findings in the context of developmental trajectories and the role of aerobic performance in hypoxia tolerance."}

We provide here an up-to-date perspective on the potential use of LDL particle number and size as complementary risk factors to predict and manage cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in the clinical realm. Studies show that a significant proportion of the population has discordant LDL particle number and cholesterol indices [non-HDL cholesterol (HDL-C)]. Data also show that risk prediction may be improved when using information on LDL particle number in patients with discordant particle number and cholesterol data. Yet, most of the current CVD guidelines conclude that LDL particle number is not superior to cholesterol indices, including non-HDL-C concentrations, in predicting CVD risk. LDL particle size, on the other hand, has not been independently associated with CVD risk after adjustment for other risk factors such as LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and HDL-C and that routine use of information pertaining to particle size to determine and manage patients' risk is not yet justified. Additional studies are required to settle the debate on which of cholesterol indices and LDL particle number is the best predictor of CVD risk, and if such measures should be integrated in clinical practice."}

The disease is associated with damaged berries infected with a community of acetic acid bacteria, yeasts, and filamentous fungi that results in rotting berries with high amounts of undesirable volatile acidity. Many insect species cause the initial grape berry damage that can lead to this disease, but most studies have focused on the role of fruit flies in facilitating symptoms and vectoring the microorganisms of this disease complex. Like fruit flies, social wasps are abundant in vineyards where they feed on ripe berries and cause significant damage, while also dispersing yeasts involved in wine fermentation. Despite this, their possible role in disease facilitation and dispersal of grape rots has not been explored. We tested the hypothesis that the paper wasp Polistes dominulus could facilitate grape sour rot in the absence of other insect vectors. Using marker gene sequencing we characterized the bacterial and fungal community of wild-caught adults. We used a sterilized foraging arena to determine if these wasps transfer viable microorganisms when foraging. We then tested if wasps harboring their native microbial community, or those inoculated with sour rot, had an effect on grape sour rot incidence and severity using a laboratory foraging arena. We found that all wasps harbor some portion of the sour rot microbial community and that they have the ability to transfer viable microorganisms when foraging. Foraging by inoculated and uninoculated wasps led to an increase in berry rot disease symptom severity and incidence. Our results indicate that paper wasps can facilitate sour rot diseases in the absence of other vectors and that the mechanism of this facilitation may include both increasing host susceptibility and transmitting these microbial communities to the grapes. Social wasps are understudied but relevant players in the sour rot ecology of vineyards."}

Twelve- week -old male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups (n = 5 each): a normal occlusion (C) group, an occlusal hypofunction (H) group, and an occlusal hypofunction group subjected to LIPUS (HL) treatment. Hypofunctional occlusion of the maxillary first molar (M1) of the H and HL groups was induced by the bite-raising technique. Only the HL group was irradiated with LIPUS for 5 days. The IRAB and PDL of M1 were examined by microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) analysis. To quantify mRNA expression of cytokines involved in PDL proliferation and development, real-time reverse transcription quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed for twist family bHLH transcription factor 1 (Twist1), periostin, and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in the PDL samples. Micro-CT analysis showed that the PDL volume was decreased in the H group compared with that of the C and HL groups. Both bone volume per tissue volume (BV / TV) of IRAB was decreased in the H group compared with that in the C group. LIPUS exposure restored BV / TV in the IRAB of the HL group. qRT-PCR analysis showed that Twist1, periostin, and CTGF mRNA levels were decreased in the H group and increased in the HL group. LIPUS exposure reduced the atrophic changes of alveolar bone by inducing the upregulation of periostin and CTGF expression to promote PDL healing after induction of occlusal hypofunction."}

These techniques and methods need periodical documentation. This observational study determined the current prevalence of endodontic treatments, and investigated the relationship of various factors with the periapical status in a Lower Austrian subpopulation. One thousand orthopantomograms of first-time university adult patients radiographed at an outpatient clinic were evaluated. For each tooth, the presence of periradicular pathosis and/or endodontic treatment was recorded, as was the quality of (post-) endodontic treatment (homogeneity and length of root canal fillings; preparation failures; posts / screws; apicoectomies; coronal restorations). Two evaluators, blinded to each other, scored all teeth. In cases of disagreement, they joined for a consensus score. In all, 22,586 teeth were counted. Of these, 2,907 teeth (12.9%) had periapical pathosis, while 2,504 teeth had undergone root canal treatment. Of the endodontically treated teeth, 52% showed no radiographic signs of apical periodontitis, while 44.9% had overt apical lesions, and 3,1% revealed widened periodontal ligament space. The majority of the root canal fillings was inhomogeneous (70.4%); 75.4% were rated too short, and 3.8% too long. The presence of apical pathosis was significantly correlated (odds ratio (OR) 2.556 [confidence interval (CI) 2.076-3.146]; P<0.0001) with poor root canal fillings (length and homogeneity). Posts or screws positively affected periapical status (OR 1.853 [CI 1.219-2.819]; P = 0.004), but endodontically treated posterior teeth were infrequently restored (posts, 7.5%; screws, 2.7%). Best results were found for teeth with both appropriate endodontic treatment and adequate coronal restoration. A high prevalence of periradicular radiolucencies was observed with root canal filled teeth, along with high numbers of unmet treatment needs. Periapical health was associated with adequate root canal obturation and high-grade postendodontic restorations, and quality regarding these latter aspects is considered mandatory to promote periapical health."}

Five sources of SBM from China, Argentina, Brazil, and the U.S ., and 4 sources from India were collected for a total of 24 sources of SBM. All samples were analyzed for energy, DM, and nutrients, and each source was included in a cornstarch based diet in which SBM was the only AA contributing ingredient. An N-free diet was also formulated. Twenty-five barrows (initial BW: 30.53 \u00b1 1.73 kg) were equipped with a T-cannula in the distal ileum and randomly allotted to a 25 \u00d7 8 Youden square design with 25 diets and 8 periods. Results indicate that the concentration of CP was greater (< 0.05) in SBM from Brazil and India (49.3 and 49.5%, respectively) than in SBM from China, Argentina, or the U.S. (45.1, 46.7, and 47.3%, respectively, as-fed basis). The concentration of most indispensable AA followed the same pattern as CP with the exception that SBM from the U.S. contained more (< 0.05) indispensable AA than SBM from China or Argentina. However, SBM from India contained more (< 0.05) trypsin inhibitors than SBM from the other countries. A greater (< 0.05) AID and SID of CP and most AA was observed in SBM from the U.S. compared with SBM from Brazil, Argentina, and India, but there were no differences between SBM from the U.S. and SBM from China. However, because of the lower concentration of AA in SBM from China, the concentration of standardized ileal digestible AA in SBM from China was less (< 0.05) than in SBM from the U.S. Soybean meal from the U.S. or Brazil had less (< 0.05) variability in SID values than SBM from Argentina, China, or India. In conclusion, the SID of CP and AA is dependent on the country where the SBM is produced. This difference and the variability within each country should be evaluated when formulating diets for pigs."}

The younger participants typically anticipated backward trajectories during fall from moving carriers while forward but non-parabolic trajectories were relatively more frequent amongst the older participants. Both patterns suggest strong sociocultural influences, with implications for models that regard development in this area as purely the inhibition of principles established in infancy. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Research with infants demonstrates an early - established belief that dropped objects fall straight down. The erroneous expectations that pre-schoolers hold about object fall are consistent with failure to inhibit the presumption of straight - down fall, in contexts where it is inappropriate. What does this study add? The research replicates and extends research with older participants, which indicates errors that cannot be explained via failed inhibition of straight - down fall. It is the first study to trace patterns of errors across late childhood, adolescence and early adulthood. A consequence of the findings is that adequate modelling in developmental psychology must consider multilayered interactions between prior representations and sociocultural experiences."}

The aims of the present study were to investigate the effects of exendin-4 on high glucose (HG)- induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and the possible mechanisms. Rat cardiomyocytes were divided into 3 groups: normal glucose group (NG group), HG group and HG + exendin-4 group (HG + Ex Group). Cardiomyocyte apoptosis was evaluated by double-staining with annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/ propidium iodide (PI) and flow cytometry. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was detected by 2\u2019,7\u2019-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCHF-DA) incubation and fluorescence microscopy. LY294002 (LY), a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway inhibitor, was added to the medium of the HG + Ex + LY Group for further western blot analysis. The proteins analyzed involved oxidative stress - associated proteins, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2), and apoptosis - associated proteins, caspase-3, Bax/B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and p-AKT / AKT. HG treatment induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis (P = 0.00) and clearly upregulated ROS production (P = 0.00); exendin-4 co-incubation also ameliorated cardiomyocyte apoptosis (P = 0.004) and decreased ROS (P = 0.00) level significantly. HO-1 and Nrf-2 protein expression levels decreased significantly in the HG group (P < 0.05), but the levels were elevated by exendin-4 intervention (P < 0.05). Furthermore, exendin-4 attenuated HG - induced higher protein expression, including cleaved caspase-3 and Bax, increased the expression of Bcl-2 protein (P < 0.05). However, these impacts of exendin-4 were counteracted significantly by co-incubation with LY294002. In addition, exendin-4 ameliorated HG - induced p-AKT / AKT lower expression, and this impact was also suppressed by LY294002. Exendin-4 ameliorates HG - induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and the mechanisms may involve anti-oxidative stress via the HO-1 / Nrf-2 system, as well as intervention of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway."}

This review contributes to the understanding of the KMAP-O framework and how it can guide the care management of patients with type 2 diabetes. It will allow the tailoring of interventions to be more effective through knowledge enhancement, increased motivation, attitudinal changes, and improved preventive practice to reduce the progression of type 2 diabetes and comorbidities.

Accordingly, we assess the relationships between the studied varieties, on the one hand, and the potential productivity - quantitative parameter links on the other hand. The bioinformatic analysis based on the graphical representation of the matrix of Euclidean distances, the principal components analysis, unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean, and principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) revealed three major clusters which were not correlated with the geographic origin. The statistical analysis based on Kendall's and Spearman correlation coefficients suggests two highly significant associations with both fruit color and pollinization and the productivity character. These results are confirmed by the multiple linear regression prediction models. In fact, based on the coefficient of determination (R (2)) value, the best model demonstrated the power of the pollinization on the tree productivity (R (2) = 0.846). Moreover, the derived directed acyclic graph showed that only two direct influences are detected: effect of tolerance on fruit and stone symmetry on side and effect of tolerance on stone form and oil content on the other side.

However, current staging guidelines for superficially invasive cancers do not acknowledge the variability in type and extent of lamina propria invasion in papillary urothelial carcinomas (PUC), and historically proposed substaging systems showed either high inter-observer variation or limited value in predicting patient outcomes. Herein we reappraise pT1 PUC substaging, aiming to identify a novel scheme which is reproducible and prognostically meaningful. Stage pT1 PUC diagnosed during years 1999-2015 were retrospectively reviewed and characterized as focal invasion confined to papillary stalk, focal invasion of tumor base, or extensive invasion of tumor base. Cases with concurrent flat carcinoma in-situ, angiolymphatic invasion, absent muscularis propria, or clinically advanced disease were excluded. We calculated cumulative incidence of recurrence, progression, and death by tumor subtype and evaluated differential risks using log-rank tests and Kaplan-Meier curves stratified by type and extent of invasion. Among 62 patients satisfying inclusion criteria, 22 of 29 patients with base extensive invasion progressed while 4 of 13 with base focal and 0 of 20 with stalk only invasion progressed. There was strong evidence that base extensive patients had higher risk of progression and death due to bladder cancer than base focal or stalk only counterparts (P<0.0001).

Here, we aim to analyse the different ageing mechanisms with regard to HIV infection. Ageing results from the time - dependent accumulation of random cellular damage. Epigenetic modifications and mitochondrial DNA haplogroups modulate ageing. In antiretroviral treatment -controlled patients, epigenetic clock appears to be advanced, and some haplogroups are associated with HIV infection severity. Telomere shortening is enhanced in HIV-infected patients because of HIV and some nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Mitochondria -related oxidative stress and mitochondrial DNA mutations are increased during ageing and also by some nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Overall, increased inflammation or ' inflammageing ' is a major driver of ageing and could result from cell senescence with secreted proinflammatory mediators, altered gut microbiota, and coinfections. In HIV-infected patients, the level of inflammation and innate immunity activation is enhanced and related to most comorbidities and to mortality. This status could result, in addition to age, from the virus itself or viral protein released from reservoirs, from HIV -enhanced gut permeability and dysbiosis, from antiretroviral treatment, from frequent cytomegalovirus and hepatitis C virus coinfections, and also from personal and environmental factors, as central fat accumulation or smoking. Adaptive immune activation and immunosenescence are associated with comorbidities and mortality in the general population but are less predictive in HIV-infected patients. Biomarkers to evaluate ageing in HIV-infected patients are required. Numerous systemic or cellular inflammatory, immune activation, oxidative stress, or senescence markers can be tested in serum or peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The novel European Study to Establish Biomarkers of Human Ageing MARK-AGE algorithm, evaluating the biological age, is currently assessed in HIV-infected patients and reveals an advanced biological age. Some enhanced inflammatory or innate immune activation markers are interesting but still not validated for the patient's follow-up.

The number of mesothelial cells to Dacron increased during the first 60 min up to 35.2 % of the seeded inoculum where after a plateau was reached. Scanning electron microscopy showed spreaded mesothelial cells adherent to the Dacron fibers. A significant increase in adherence was observed after preincubation of Dacron with 10 \u03bcg/mL fibronectin, but no improvement was found after preincubation with human serum albumin or gelatin. Mesothelial cells adhered better to Gelcoated than to Gelsealed or plain Dacron. The adherence of mesothelial cells to ePTFE (Teflon) was significantly poorer. No significant differences in adherence were found between mesothelial and endothelial cells. Mesothelial cell growth on Dacron resulted in a modest increase in the number of viable cells during 27 days, which implies biocompatibility of Dacron and mesothelial cells in vitro."}

The alERC overlaps with regions that are affected earliest by Alzheimer's disease pathology, yet its cognitive function remains poorly understood. Previous human fMRI studies have focused on its role in object memory, but rodent studies on the putatively homologous lateral entorhinal cortex suggest that it also plays an important role in representing spatial properties of objects. In order to investigate the cognitive effects of human alERC volume differences, we developed an eyetracking-based task to evaluate intra-item configural processing (i.e., processing the arrangement of an object's features), and used manual segmentation based on a recently- developed protocol to delineate the alERC / pmERC as well as other medial temporal lobe (MTL) subregions. In a group of older adult men and women at varying stages of brain atrophy and cognitive decline, we found that intra-item configural processing - regardless of an object's novelty - was strongly predicted by alERC volume, but not by the volume of any other MTL subregion. These results provide the first evidence that the human alERC plays a role in supporting a distinct aspect of object processing, namely attending to the arrangement of an object's component features.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Alzheimer's disease pathology appears earliest in brain regions that overlap with the anterolateral entorhinal cortex (alERC). However, the cognitive role of the alERC is poorly understood. Previous human studies treat the alERC as an extension of the neighboring perirhinal cortex, supporting object memory. Animal studies suggest that the alERC may support the spatial properties of objects. In a group of older adult humans at the earliest stages of cognitive decline, we show that alERC volume selectively predicted configural processing (attention to the spatial arrangement of an object's parts). This is the first study to demonstrate a cognitive role related to alERC volume in humans. This task can be adapted to serve as an early detection method for Alzheimer's disease pathology."}

Hypertension is a prevalent and costly chronic condition in the U.S. and worldwide, and alcohol use is a modifiable hypertension risk factor. To evaluate the effect of receiving BI for unhealthy drinking on blood pressure (BP) control among adult hypertensive patients by analyzing secondary data from a clustered, randomized controlled trial on alcohol screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment (SBIRT) implementation by primary care physicians (PCP intervention arm) and non-physician providers and medical assistants (NPP & MA intervention arm) in a large, integrated health care delivery system. Observational, prospective cohort study. 3811 adult hypertensive primary care patients screening positive for past-year heavy drinking at baseline, of which 1422 (37%) had an electronic health record BP measure at baseline and 18-month follow-up. Change in BP and controlled BP (systolic/diastolic BP <140/90 mmHg). Overall no significant associations were found between alcohol BI and BP change at 18-month follow-up when analyzing the combined sample of subjects in both intervention arms. However, moderation analyses found that receiving BI for positive past-year unhealthy drinking was positively associated with better BP control at 18months in the PCP intervention arm, and for those with lower heavy drinking frequency and poor BP control at the index screening. Our findings suggest that hypertensive patients may benefit from receiving physician brief intervention for unhealthy alcohol use in primary care. Findings also highlight potential population-level benefits of alcohol BI if widely applied, suggesting a need for the development of innovative strategies to facilitate SBIRT delivery in primary care settings."}

Perhaps the most well-studied and prevalent EDC is 17\u03b1-ethinylestradiol (EE2), an active ingredient in oral contraceptives, which is known to cause dramatic reductions in male -typical behaviors. While it is likely that alterations in male courtship behavior decrease reproductive fitness, this is rarely explicitly examined. To this end, whether EE2 exposure reduces male attractiveness to female Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendens, was investigated by showing females video images of exposed and unexposed males. Females were randomly assigned to one of two exposure conditions (exposed to EE2, control) and each subject then viewed four different video combinations of male conspecifics (courting exposed + exposed; courting unexposed + unexposed; courting unexposed + exposed; swimming unexposed + exposed). Females, regardless of whether or not they were exposed to EE2, directed markedly less behavior towards exposed males, especially when they viewed an exposed male and an unexposed male simultaneously. These findings demonstrate that EE2 can have significant individual - and population-level consequences on fitness by disrupting sexual selection and, ultimately, the success of exposed males."}

A home-made acrylic phantom able to support a film (EBT3) in its coronal plane was used. The phantom was CT scanned and three coplanar small targets (a central and two peripheral) were outlined in the Eclipse system. Peripheral targets were 6 cm apart from the central one. A reference IMRS plan was designed to simultaneously treat the three targets, but only a single isocenter located at the center of the central target was used. After positioning the phantom on the linac using the room lasers, a CBCT scan was acquired and the reference plan were mapped on it, by placing the planned isocenter at the intersection of the landmarks used in the film showing the linac isocenter. The mapped plan was then recalculated and delivered. The film dose distribution was derived using a cloud computing application (www.radiochromic.com) that uses a triple-channel dosimetry algorithm. Comparison of dose distributions using the gamma index (5%/1 mm) were performed over a 5 \u00d7 5 cm(2) region centered over each target. 2D shifts required to get the best gamma passing rates on the peripheral target regions were compared with the reported ones for the central target. The experiment was repeated ten times in different sessions. Average 2D shifts required to achieve optimal gamma passing rates (99%, 97%, 99%) were 0.7 mm (SD: 0.3 mm), 0.8 mm (SD: 0.4 mm) and 0.8 mm (SD: 0.3 mm), for the central and the two peripheral targets, respectively. No statistical differences (p > 0.05) were found for targeting accuracy between the central and the two peripheral targets.

However, excessive exogenous Zn(2+) would disrupt cellular Zn(2+) homeostasis and cause toxicity. In particular, Zinc salts or ZnO nanoparticles exposure could induce respiratory injury. Although previous studies have indicated that organelle damage (including mitochondria or lysosomes) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production are involved in Zn(2+) -induced toxicity, the interplay between mitochondria / lysosomes damage and ROS production is obscure. Herein, we demonstrated that Zn(2+) could induce deglycosylation of lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 and 2 (LAMP-1 and LAMP-2), which primarily locate in late endosomes / lysosomes, in A549 lung epithelium cells. Intriguingly, LAMP-2 knockdown further aggravated Zn(2+) -mediated ROS production and cell death, indicating LAMP-2 (not LAMP-1) was involved in Zn(2+) -induced toxicity. Our results provide a new insight that LAMP-2 contributes to the ROS clearance and cell death induced by Zn(2+) treatment, which would help us to get a better understanding of Zn(2+) -induced toxicity in respiratory system."}

Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) facilitates the detection of both spatial and spectral information in a single data acquisition, however, instrumentation for HSI is typically complex, bulky and expensive. We sought to overcome these limitations using a novel robust and low cost HSI camera based on a spectrally resolved detector array (SRDA). We integrated this HSI camera into a wide-field reflectance-based imaging system operating in the near-infrared range to assess the suitability for in vivo imaging of exogenous fluorescent contrast agents. Using this fluorescence HSI (fHSI) system, we were able to accurately resolve the presence and concentration of at least 7 fluorescent dyes in solution. We also demonstrate high spectral unmixing precision, signal linearity with dye concentration and at depth in tissue mimicking phantoms, and delineate 4 fluorescent dyes in vivo. Our approach, including statistical background removal, could be directly generalised to broader spectral ranges, for example, to resolve tissue reflectance or autofluorescence and in future be tailored to video rate applications requiring snapshot HSI data acquisition."}

We performed a prospective study of frequent ED users in an adult only, level 1 trauma center with approximately 90,000 visits per year. Frequent ED users were defined as those who make four or more ED visits in a 12 month period. Participants were administered a piloted structured interview by a trained researcher querying demographics, ED usage, perceived barriers to care, and potential aids to maintaining health. Of 1,523 screened patients, 297 were identified as frequent ED users. One hundred frequent ED users were enrolled. The mean age was 48 years (95% CI 45-51). The majority of subjects were female (64%, 64/100, 95% CI 55-73%), white (61%, 60/98, 95% CI 52-71%) and insured by Medicaid (55%, 47/86, 95% CI 44-65%) or Medicare (23%, 20/86, 95% CI 14-32%).

Since 2009, the Swedish Knee Arthroplasty Register (SKAR) has been collecting information on the prophylactic antibiotic regime used at every individual operation. In Sweden, when there is allergy to penicillin, clindamycin has been the recommended alternative. We examined whether there were differences in the rate of revision due to infection depending on which antibiotic was used as systemic prophylaxis. Patients and methods - Patients who had a total knee arthroplasty (TKA) performed due to osteoarthritis (OA) during the years 2009-2015 were included in the study. Information on which antibiotic was used was available for 80,018 operations (55,530 patients). Survival statistics were used to calculate the rate of revision due to infection until the end of 2015, comparing the group of patients who received cloxacillin with those who received clindamycin as systemic prophylaxis. Results - Cloxacillin was used in 90% of the cases, clindamycin in 7%, and cephalosporins in 2%. The risk of being revised due to infection was higher when clindamycin was used than when cloxacillin was used (RR =1.5, 95% CI: 1.2-2.0; p = 0.001). There was no significant difference in the revision rate for other causes (p = 0.2). Interpretation - We advise that patients reporting allergic reaction to penicillin should have their allergic history explored. In the absence of a clear history of type-I allergic reaction (e.g. urticaria, anaphylaxis, or bronchospasm), we suggest the use of a third-generation cephalosporin instead of clindamycin as perioperative prophylaxis when undergoing a TKR. No recommendation can be given regarding patients with type-1 allergy."}

Thus, detecting PPIs is extremely important to understand the molecular mechanisms of biological systems. Although many PPIs data have been generated by high-throughput technologies for a variety of organisms, the whole interatom is still far from complete. In addition, the high-throughput technologies for detecting PPIs has some unavoidable defects, including time consumption, high cost, and high error rate. In recent years, with the development of machine learning, computational methods have been broadly used to predict PPIs, and can achieve good prediction rate. In this paper, we present here PCVMZM, a computational method based on a Probabilistic Classification Vector Machines (PCVM) model and Zernike moments (ZM) descriptor for predicting the PPIs from protein amino acids sequences. Specifically, a Zernike moments (ZM) descriptor is used to extract protein evolutionary information from Position-Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM) generated by Position-Specific Iterated Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (PSI-BLAST). Then, PCVM classifier is used to infer the interactions among protein. When performed on PPIs datasets of Yeast and H. Pylori, the proposed method can achieve the average prediction accuracy of 94.48% and 91.25%, respectively. In order to further evaluate the performance of the proposed method, the state-of-the-art support vector machines (SVM) classifier is used and compares with the PCVM model. Experimental results on the Yeast dataset show that the performance of PCVM classifier is better than that of SVM classifier. The experimental results indicate that our proposed method is robust, powerful and feasible, which can be used as a helpful tool for proteomics research."}

We examined the range of powers embodied in and exercised through various mechanisms, processes and social relations and their impact on local communities ' access to FPA resources and associated benefits along the historical trajectory of forest governance in Zimbabwe.

Local communities ' access to low value FPA resources improved during the post-colonial period but access to high value resources like commercial timber as well as sharing income benefits derived from FPA commercial activities remained a pipe dream. Regulation, legitimation, force and markets constituted the mixture of the power elements that FPA governing authorities used to exclude local communities. These powers remained intact despite attempts at collaborative governance in the 1990s. However, from the year 2000, local communities expressed their dissatisfaction with the centralised exclusionary governance system by invading the FPAs rendering them ungovernable.

However, its safety and efficacy have been controversial since its initial use and there is uncertainty about its long-term efficacy and safety. Recently, the repositioning of cardiac glycosides is to function in anti-tumor activity via multiple working pathways. It is interesting to compare the potential effects of digoxin in clinical patients and cell lines. First, we analyze patient information retrieved from the National Health Insurance Research database of Taiwan between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2000. This retrospective study included a study cohort (1,219 patients) and a comparison cohort. Our analytical data suggested that patients taking digoxin are at an increased risk of cancers, including breast, liver, and lung cancers, during the 10-year follow-up period. In contrast to the anti-tumor function of digoxin, we further examined the potential pathway of digoxin via the cell -based strategy using several breast cancer cell lines, including MCF-7, BT-474, MAD-MB-231, and ZR-75-1. Digoxin consistently exerted its cytotoxicity to these four cell lines with various range of concentration. However, the proliferation of ZR-75-1 cells was the only cell lines induced by digoxin and the others were dramatically suppressed by digoxin. The responsiveness of SRSF3 to digoxin might be involved with cell-type differences.

It sought to expand upon an earlier study that explored the processes involved in transitioning away from RSA among adults, which revealed that occupying this ambivalent space is a crucial part of this process. Interpretive phenomenological analysis (IPA) was used. This methodology was designed to explore the lived experiences and meaning making and enabled interpretation of the multidimensional subjective experiences of RSA participants. In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight adult women with a history of RSA who had participated in a therapeutic intervention at the research site (Skills for Safer Living: A Psychosocial / Psychoeducational Intervention for People with Recurrent Suicide Attempts [SfSL / PISA]). The six stages of IPA were followed to analyse the interview data. Analysis revealed the superordinate theme, ' surviving moment to moment ', which refers to a precarious state of making decisions about one's life and destiny on a moment -to- moment basis without clear commitment to either life or death. Two subordinate themes were identified: ' deciding not to die in the moment ' when the participants were more invested in dying than living and ' deciding to live in the moment ' when they were more invested in living than dying. The study illuminated the complex process of making decisions about ones' destiny on a moment -to- moment basis. It revealed the torment experienced when occupying this state, while paradoxically, also revealing how indecision about life and death provided a lifeline opportunity for those with RSA. Clinicians who recognize the subtle distinctions associated with this in-between state can tailor their interventions accordingly. Surviving moment to moment is characterized by a state of emotional flux and uncertainty about one's destiny, where the person has not fully committed to either life or death. Within this state, there are two interlinked subprocesses, whereby the person is leaning more towards death or life. A critical feature in working with this client group is to recognize their ambiguity and the fragility and temporality of their decisions about their destiny. The practitioner has an opportunity to be a catalyst in the momentum towards life by demonstrating understanding of this survival struggle and tailoring intervention to fit with the nuanced processes within this state."}

The difference was not statistically significant (p=0.15, 95% CI for median difference -0.27 to 1.93 hours) with a small effect size (Pearson's r=-0.08). The median length of induction to birth was 13.6 hours for women induced at 42 weeks and 16.5 hours for women induced at 41-42 weeks. This difference was also not statistically significant (p=0.14, 95% CI for median difference -7.25 to 1.20 hours) with a small effect size (Pearson's r=-0.13). This study demonstrated no statistically significant difference s in length of labour and induction following a change in the management of postmature pregnancy to earlier induction. A large study is needed to establish definitively the effects of earlier induction on labour outcomes."}

Safe and effective drugs are urgently needed for the treatment of OA. Previous study reported that Astragaloside IV (ASG-IV) had exerted a protective effect against articular cartilage degeneration by promoting rapid proliferation of chondrocyte. Therefore, the aim of our study is to explore the effects and mechanisms of ASG-IV in chondrocyte apoptosis. Isobaric Tags For Relative And Absolute Quantitation (iTRAQ)-based quantitative proteomics was used to quantitatively detect and map proteins in SW1353 chondrocyte-like cells pre-treated with ASG-IV or interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) or ASG-IV + IL-1\u03b2. The iTRAQ-labeled peptides were fractionated by high-accuracy liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Cell apoptosis and differentially expressed proteins was detected by flow cytometry (FCM), quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and western blotting, respectively. The apoptosis of the IL-1\u03b2 - induced SW1353 cells treated with ASG-IV was greatly inhibited. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that gamma actin 1 (ACTG1) and Yes Associated Protein 1 (YAP1), participating in the Hippo signaling pathway and Vitronectin (VTN) and Collagen Type I Alpha 1 Chain (COL1A1), involving in the extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction signaling pathway, were all significantly up-regulated in the IL-1\u03b2 - induced SW1353 cells after treatment with ASG-IV. The qRT-PCR and Western blotting results confirmed the up-regulation of these four genes. ASG-IV played a positive role in human osteoarthritic chondrocyte apoptosis, possibly through modulation of the Hippo signaling pathway by up-regulating YAP1 and ACTG1 expression, and also by up-regulating VTN and COL1A1, which are involved in the ECM-receptor interaction pathway. Taken together, all the results suggested that ASG-IV had a novel therapeutic potential for the treatment of OA."}

We assessed the safety of vemurafenib in a large population of patients with few alternative treatment options; we report updated 2-year safety. This was an open-label, multicentre study of vemurafenib (960 mg bid) in patients with previously treated or untreated BRAF mutation - positive metastatic melanoma (cobas(\u00ae) 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test). The primary end-point was safety; efficacy end-points were secondary. An exploratory analysis was performed to assess safety outcomes in patients with long duration of response (DOR) (\u226512 or \u226524 months). After a median follow-up of 32.2 months (95% CI, 31.1-33.2 months), 3079/3219 patients (96%) had discontinued treatment. Adverse events (AEs) were largely consistent with previous reports; the most common all-grade treatment -related AEs were arthralgia (37%), alopecia (25%) and hyperkeratosis (23%); the most common grade 3/4 treatment -related AEs were squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (8%) and keratoacanthoma (8%). In the exploratory analysis, patients with DOR \u226512 months (n = 287) or \u226524 months (n = 133) were more likely to experience grade 3/4 AEs than the overall population. No new specific safety signals were observed with longer vemurafenib exposure. After 2 years' follow-up, safety was maintained in this large group of patients with BRAF(V600) mutation - positive metastatic melanoma who are more representative of routine clinical practice than typical clinical trial populations. These data suggest that long-term vemurafenib treatment is effective and tolerable without the development of new safety signals."}

This is the penultimate paper in a series of eight, describing the impact of design choices on the practical implementation of pragmatic trials. This paper focuses on the practical challenges of collecting and reporting safety data and of monitoring trial conduct while maintaining routine clinical care practice. Current ICH guidance recommends that, all serious adverse events (SAEs) and all drug -related events must be reported in an interventional trial. In line with current guidance, we propose a risk based approach to the collection of non - drug related non-serious AEs, and even serious events not related to treatment based on the risk profile of the medicine /class in the patient population of interest. Different options available to support the collection and reporting of safety data whilst minimizing study -related follow-up visits are discussed. A risk -based approach to monitoring trial conduct is also discussed, highlighting the difference in the balance of risks likely to occur in a pragmatic trial compared to traditional clinical trials, and the careful consideration that must be given to the mitigation and management of these risks in order to maintain routine care."}

A total of 69 eyes in 67 Chinese patients who received IOL explants were studied. The patients ' mean age at the time of explantation was 46.1 years old [SD 22.5 (6-85)], and 37 patients were female (55.2%). Regarding employment, 47.8% were farmers, 23.9% were retired, 16.4% were students, 4.5% were unemployed, 3% were workers, and 4.5% were other (including staff members, teachers and officers). The main reasons for explantation were dislocation / decentration in 41 cases (59.4%) and retinal detachment in 10 cases (14.5%). The third most prevalent cause was incorrect lens power in 7 eyes (10.1%). The remaining reasons were endophthalmitis in 6 cases (8.7%), posterior capsular opacity in 3 eyes (4.3%), and impacting retinal surgery operation in 2 cases (2.9%). The main comorbidities were high myopia in 18 eyes (26.1%), trauma in 8 eyes (11.6%), retinal detachment in 6 eyes (8.7%), congenital cataracts in 8 eyes (11.6%), and Marfan's syndrome in 2 eyes (2.9%). The mean time from implantation to explantation was 4.0y [SD 4.2 (0.005-15)]. Treatment after explantation included posterior chamber IOL implantation in 44 eyes (63.8%) and aphakia in 25 eyes (36.2%). After surgery, the best corrected visual ability (BCVA) was improved in 50 cases (72.5%), including 28 patients (40.6%) in whom visual ability was improved by more than two lines. Dislocation / decentration is the main cause for explantation, and high myopia is a main risk factor. Posterior chamber IOL implantation remains the most elected treatment after explantation."}

The WHOQOL-OLD questionnaire was answered by 105 older adults aged 60 to 90 years who were newly fitted hearing aids on the day of fitting and at 2 - 6 months afterward. The associations between the daily hours of hearing aid usage and social relations with changes in the WHOQOL-OLD total score after hearing aids fitting were estimated adjusting for possible confounders. Older persons with hearing loss experienced significant increases in WHOQOL-OLD total score after hearing aid fitting. Regular use of hearing aid was associated with a greater increase in the total score. The combined categorical variable of social relations and hearing aid usage revealed no separate effects of these two variables, but a combined effect; only those with frequent social interactions who used their hearing aid regularly had a significantly greater increase in WHOQOL-OLD total score. This study's findings indicate that hearing aid fitting may be associated with a subsequent improvement in older - person - specific QOL by improvements in hearing due to the hearing aid, and possibly enhanced communication opportunities."}

Administrative data are often used to conduct comparative effectiveness research (CER) with sufficient sample sizes to enhance detection of important outcomes. However, such studies are prone to misclassification errors because of the variable accuracy of discharge diagnosis codes. The aim of this study was to develop an automated, scalable, and accurate method to determine the presence or absence of pneumonia in children using chest imaging reports. The multi-institutional PHIS + clinical repository was developed to support pediatric CER by expanding an administrative database of children's hospitals with detailed clinical data. To develop a scalable approach to find patients with bacterial pneumonia more accurately, we developed a Natural Language Processing (NLP) application to extract relevant information from chest diagnostic imaging reports. Domain experts established a reference standard by manually annotating 282 reports to train and then test the NLP application. Findings of pleural effusion, pulmonary infiltrate, and pneumonia were automatically extracted from the reports and then used to automatically classify whether a report was consistent with bacterial pneumonia. Compared with the annotated diagnostic imaging reports reference standard, the most accurate implementation of machine learning algorithms in our NLP application allowed extracting relevant findings with a sensitivity of .939 and a positive predictive value of .925. It allowed classifying reports with a sensitivity of .71, a positive predictive value of .86, and a specificity of .962. When compared with each of the domain experts manually annotating these reports, the NLP application allowed for significantly higher sensitivity (.71 vs .527) and similar positive predictive value and specificity. NLP -based pneumonia information extraction of pediatric diagnostic imaging reports performed better than domain experts in this pilot study. NLP is an efficient method to extract information from a large collection of imaging reports to facilitate CER."}

Analysis of VOCs has been proposed as a noninvasive diagnostic tool for certain cancers. Detailed research on the VOCs in gas exhaled by cell can characterize cell type specific metabolites and may be helpful to detect the cancer markers in clinical practice. Methods: Solid phase microextraction - gas chromatography - mass spectrometry was used to detect VOCs in the headspace of tissue culture flask in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cell line JEKO and acute mononuclear leukemia cell line SHI-1, to elaborate the characteristic gaseous biomarkers of hematological malignancies. While macrophage cells and lymphocytic cells were acted as control. The blank group was only the RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum that without cells. Results: Comparing to control group, the concentration of dimethyl sulphide, 2,4-dimethyl-heptane, methylbenzene, o-xylene, dodecane and 1,3-ditert-butylbenzene in JEKO cells were relatively higher, while the concentration of ethanol, hexanal and benzaldehyde was lower. In SHI-1 cells, the levels of 2,4-dimethyl-heptane, benzene, 4-methyldecane, chloroform, 3,7-dimethyl dodecane and hexadecane were significantly elevated, but the levels of hexanol and cyclohexanol were distinctly reduced. Conclusions: This pilot study revealed that the malignant hematological cells could change the components of VOCs in the cell culture flask in a cell type specific pattern. The traits of VOCs in our setting offered new strategy for hematological malignancies tracing, and would act as potential biomarkers in diagnosis of malignant hematological diseases."}

A comprehensive evaluation of the efficacy of multiple medication combinations is missing. To summarize and compare the meta-analytically determined efficacy of pharmacologic combination strategies of antipsychotic drugs in adults with schizophrenia. Systematic search of PubMed and PsycInfo until May 13, 2016. Meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials comparing the efficacy of antipsychotic drugs combined with other antipsychotic or nonantipsychotic medications vs placebos or antipsychotic monotherapy among adults with schizophrenia. Independent reviewers extracted the data and assessed the quality of the methods of the included meta-analyses using A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR), adding 6 new items to rate their quality. Effect sizes, expressed as standardized mean difference /Hedges g or risk ratio, were compared separately for combinations with any antipsychotic drug and for combinations with clozapine. The primary outcome was total symptom reduction. Secondary outcomes included positive and negative symptoms, treatment recommendations by authors, study-defined inefficacies, cognitive and depressive symptoms, discontinuation of treatment because of any cause, and inefficacies or intolerabilities. Of 3397 publications, 29 meta-analyses testing 42 combination strategies in 381 individual trials and among 19 833 participants were included. For total symptom reductions, 32 strategies that augmented any antipsychotic drug and 5 strategies that augmented clozapine were examined. Fourteen combination treatments outperformed controls (standard mean difference /Hedges g, -1.27 [95% CI, -2.35 to -0.19] to -0.23 [95% CI, -0.44 to -0.02]; P = .05). No combination strategies with clozapine outperformed controls. The quality of the methods of the meta-analyses was generally high (mean score, 9 of a maximum score of 11) but the quality of the meta-analyzed studies was low (mean score, 2.8 of a maximum score of 8). Treatment recommendations correlated with the effect size (correlation coefficient, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.35-0.10; P < .001), yet effect sizes were inversely correlated with study quality (correlation coefficient, -0.06; 95% CI, 0.01 to -0.12; P = .02). Meta-analyses of 21 interventions fully or partially recommended their use, with recommendations being positively correlated with the effect sizes of the pooled intervention. However, the effect sizes were inversely correlated with meta-analyzed study quality, reducing confidence in these recommendations. Higher - quality trials and patient -based meta-analyses are needed to determine whether subpopulations might benefit from combination treatment, as no single strategy can be recommended for patients with schizophrenia based on the current meta-analytic literature."}

Vascular calcification is driven by aldosterone -sensitive osteogenic transformation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). We show that even in absence of exogenous aldosterone, silencing and pharmacological inhibition (spironolactone, eplerenone) of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) ameliorated phosphate - induced osteo- / chondrogenic transformation of primary human aortic smooth muscle cells (HAoSMCs). High phosphate concentrations up-regulated aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) expression in HAoSMCs. Silencing and deficiency of CYP11B2 in VSMCs ameliorated phosphate - induced osteogenic reprogramming and calcification. Phosphate treatment was followed by nuclear export of APEX1, a CYP11B2 transcriptional repressor. APEX1 silencing up-regulated CYP11B2 expression and stimulated osteo- / chondrogenic transformation. APEX1 overexpression blunted the phosphate - induced osteo- / chondrogenic transformation and calcification of HAoSMCs. Cyp11b2 expression was higher in aortic tissue of hyperphosphatemic klotho-hypomorphic (kl/kl) mice than in wild-type mice. In adrenalectomized kl/kl mice, spironolactone treatment still significantly ameliorated aortic osteoinductive reprogramming. Our findings suggest that VSMCs express aldosterone synthase, which is up-regulated by phosphate - induced disruption of APEX1 -dependent gene suppression. Vascular CYP11B2 may contribute to stimulation of VSMCs osteo- / chondrogenic transformation during hyperphosphatemia."}

Yet, the focus on continuous improvement and individualization of curricula does not exempt programs from treating learners in a fair manner. When learners fail to meet key competencies and are placed on probation or dismissed from training programs, issues of fairness may form the basis of their legal claims. In a literature search, we found no in-depth examination of fairness. In this paper, we utilize a systems lens to examine fairness within postgraduate medical education contexts, focusing on educational opportunities, assessment practices, decision-making processes, fairness from a legal standpoint, and fairness in the context of the learning environment. While we provide examples of fairness issues within US training programs, concerns regarding fairness are relevant in any medical education system which utilizes a competency-based education framework. Assessment oversight committees and annual programmatic evaluations, while recommended, will not guarantee fairness within postgraduate medical education programs, but they can provide a window into 'hidden' threats to fairness, as everything from training experiences to assessment practices may be examined by these committees. One of the first steps programs can take is to recognize that threats to fairness may exist in any educational program, including their own, and begin conversations about how to address these issues."}

BHV-1 is able to spread quickly in a plaque -wise manner and invade by breaching the basement membrane (BM) barrier in the respiratory mucosa. BHV-1 Us3, a serine/threonine kinase, induces a dramatic cytoskeletal reorganization and BHV-1 Us9, a tail-anchored membrane protein, is required for axonal transport of viruses in neurons. In this study, we investigated the role of Us3 and Us9 during BHV-1 infection in the respiratory mucosa. First, we constructed and characterized BHV-1 Us3 null, Us9 null and revertant viruses. Then, we analysed the viral replication and plaque size (latitude) in Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells and the respiratory mucosa as well as viral penetration depth underneath the BM of the respiratory mucosa when inoculated with these recombinant viruses. Knockout of Us3 resulted in a 1 log10 reduction in viral titre and plaque size (latitude) in MDBK cells and the trachea mucosa. There were no defects in the cell-to-cell spread observed for BHV-1 Us9 null virus. Both BHV-1 Us3 null and Us9 null viruses showed a significant reduction of plaque penetration underneath the BM; however, penetration was not completely inhibited. In conclusion, the current findings demonstrated that Us3 and Us9 play an important role in the invasion of BHV-1 through the BM of the respiratory mucosa, which shows the way forward for research -based attenuation of viruses in order to make safer and better - performing vaccines."}

GWSS mating communication is based on vibrational signals; therefore, vibrational mating disruption could be an alternative to insecticides for suppression of GWSS population. Our objectives were to identify spectral features of female signal that elicit male signaling, design disruptive signals able to alter male perception and acceptance of a female, and determine the signal intensity required for future field applications. Results showed that male responses to playback of modified female signals were significantly reduced by 60-75%when part of the female signal spectral components above or below 400 Hz were deleted. Playback bioassays showed that transmission of an 80 Hz pure frequency tone to plants completely suppressed male signaling to female signal playback, even if the disruptive signal amplitude was 10 dB lower than the female signal playback. Although the mechanism underlying cessation of male signaling activity in the presence of disruption is not yet understood, results suggest that an 80 Hz vibrational signal should be tested in laboratory and field experiments to assess its efficacy in disrupting mating of GWSS."}

Most recalled little ' smoking -related' discussion with clinicians but were receptive to talking openly. Clinicians revealed several barriers to discussion. Participants ' continued smoking was explained by the stress of diagnosis; desire to maintain personal control; and lack of connection between smoking, cancer and health. A range of barriers to smoking cessation exist for patients and family members. These are insufficiently assessed and considered by clinicians.

Survey data showed that youth with mobility impairments are diverse in their experiences with sexual behavior and sources of sexual health information. Although connected with primary care providers, few received information about sexual health. Interventions to improve youths ' well-being should include comprehensive care and education that promotes and supports healthy sexual development."}

In this paper, we present a detailed, overall equation, describing a possible metabolic link between ureagenesis and gluconeogenesis. We adopted a guided approach in which we strongly suggest that students, when faced with the problem of obtaining the overall equation of a metabolic pathway, carefully account for all atoms and charges of the single reactions, as well as the cellular localizations of the substrates, and the related transport systems. If this suggestion is always taken into account, a balanced, overall equation of a metabolic pathway will be obtained, which strongly facilitates the discussion of its physiological role. Unfortunately, textbooks often report unbalanced overall equations of metabolic pathways, including ureagenesis and gluconeogenesis. Most likely the reason is that metabolism and enzymology have been neglected for about three decades, owing to the remarkable advances of molecular biology and molecular genetics. In this paper, we strongly suggest that students, when faced with the problem of obtaining the overall reaction of a metabolic pathway, carefully control if the single reactions are properly balanced for atoms and charges. Following this suggestion, we were able to obtain an overall equation describing the metabolic interrelationship between ureagenesis and gluconeogenesis, in which urea and glucose are the final products. The aim is to better rationalize this topic and to convince students and teachers that metabolism is an important and rewarding chapter of human physiology."}

Thus, mapping of B-cell epitopes of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) is critical to identify key immunogenic regions of HlyE. A random 20-mer peptide library was used for biopanning with enriched anti-HlyE polyclonal antibodies from typhoid patient sera. Bioinformatic tools were used to refine, analyze and map the enriched peptide sequences against the protein to identify the epitopes. The analysis identified both linear and conformational epitopes on the HlyE protein. The predicted linear GAAAGIVAG and conformational epitope PYSQESVLSADSQNQK were further validated against the pooled sera. The identified epitopes were then used to isolate epitope specific monoclonal antibodies by antibody phage display. Monoclonal scFv antibodies were enriched for both linear and conformational epitopes. Molecular docking was performed to elucidate the antigen-antibody interaction of the monoclonal antibodies against the epitopes on the HlyE monomer and oligomer structure. An in-depth view of the mechanistic and positional characteristics of the antibodies and epitope for HlyE was successfully accomplished by a combination of phage display and bioinformatic analysis. The predicted function and structure of the antibodies highlights the possibility of utilizing the antibodies as neutralizing agents for typhoid fever."}

ENI and SCI of 1%, 5% and 10% w/w dexamethasone were fabricated using a blend of poly-lactic acid (PLA) and poly-vinyl alcohol (PVA). Inserts were characterized for morphology, thickness, pH, drug content, drug crystallinity, in vitro drug release, sterility, dimethylformamide (DMF) and chloroform content, and cytotoxicity. The thickness of 1%, 5%, and 10% dexamethasone -loaded ENIs were found to be 50\u03bcm, 62.5\u03bcm, and 93.3\u03bcm, respectively, with good folding endurance. SCIs were brittle, with thickness values >200\u03bcm. Drug release rates from 1%, 5% and 10% ENIs were found to be 0.62\u03bcg/h, 1.46\u03bcg/h, and 2.30\u03bcg/h, respectively, while those from SCIs were erratic. DMF content in ENIs and SCIs were 0.007% w/w and 0.123% w/w, respectively, while chloroform was not detected. No cytotoxicity was observed from ENIs in cultured bovine corneal endothelial cells for up to 24h. We conclude that ENIs are better than SCIs and could be utilized as a potential delivery system for treating anterior segment ocular diseases."}

TRPM2 -mediated Ca(2+) signaling has been implicated in the aggravation of inflammatory diseases. Therefore, the development of TRPM2 inhibitors to prevent the aggravation of these diseases is expected. We recently reported that some Tyrphostin AG-related compounds inhibited the H2O2 - induced activation of TRPM2 by scavenging the intracellular hydroxyl radical. In the present study, we examined the effects of AG-related compounds on H2O2 - induced cellular responses in human monocytic U937 cells, which functionally express TRPM2. The effects of AG-related compounds on H2O2 - induced changes in intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation, and CXCL8 secretion were assessed using U937 cells. Ca(2+) influxes via TRPM2 in response to H2O2 were blocked by AG-related compounds. AG-related compounds also inhibited the H2O2 - induced activation of ERK, and subsequent secretion of CXCL8 mediated by TRPM2 - dependent and - independent mechanisms. Our results show that AG-related compounds inhibit H2O2 - induced CXCL8 secretion following ERK activation, which is mediated by TRPM2 - dependent and - independent mechanisms in U937 cells. We previously reported that AG-related compounds blocked H2O2 - induced TRPM2 activation by scavenging the hydroxyl radical. The inhibitory effects of AG-related compounds on TRPM2 - independent responses may be due to scavenging of the hydroxyl radical."}

However, it is still unclear whether lactate, the end product of aerobic glycolysis, plays any role in osteoblast differentiation. Herein we report that in cultures of osteoblast-lineage cells, lactate promoted alkaline phosphatase -positive cell formation, increased the activity of alkaline phosphatase, and induced the expression of osteocalcin. This osteoblast differentiation -inducing effect of lactate can be inhibited by blocking its entry into cells with MCT1 siRNA or inhibitors, and by interfering with its metabolism by using specific siRNAs for LDHB and PDH. Moreover, lactate stabilized HIF1\u03b1 expression and inhibited HIF1\u03b1 activity, with BAY87-2243 lowering the osteoblast differentiation -inducing effect of lactate. Thus, these findings reveal an unrecognized role for aerobic glycolysis in osteoblast differentiation via its end product, lactate."}
{"document_id": "28538491", "text": "Committee Opinion No. 701 Summary: Choosing The Route Of Hysterectomy For Benign Disease Hysterectomy is one of the most frequently performed surgical procedures in the United States. Selection of the route of hysterectomy for benign causes can be influenced by the size and shape of the vagina and uterus; accessibility to the uterus; extent of extrauterine disease; the need for concurrent procedures; surgeon training and experience; average case volume; available hospital technology, devices, and support; whether the case is emergent or scheduled; and preference of the informed patient. Vaginal and laparoscopic procedures are considered \" minimally invasive \" surgical approaches because they do not require a large abdominal incision and, thus, typically are associated with shortened hospitalization and postoperative recovery times compared with open abdominal hysterectomy. Minimally invasive approaches to hysterectomy should be performed, whenever feasible, based on their well-documented advantages over abdominal hysterectomy. The vaginal approach is preferred among the minimally invasive approaches. Laparoscopic hysterectomy is a preferable alternative to open abdominal hysterectomy for those patients in whom a vaginal hysterectomy is not indicated or feasible. Although minimally invasive approaches to hysterectomy are the preferred route, open abdominal hysterectomy remains an important surgical option for some patients. The obstetrician - gynecologist should discuss the options with patients and make clear recommendations on which route of hysterectomy will maximize benefits and minimize risks given the specific clinical situation. The relative advantages and disadvantages of the approaches to hysterectomy should be discussed in the context of the patient 's values and preferences, and the patient and health care provider should together determine the best course of action after this discussion."}

By presenting two stimulus components simultaneously, flickering at different temporal frequencies (frequency tagging) while measuring steady-state visual evoked potentials, we can assess responses to the individual components, including direct measurements of suppression on each other, and various nonlinear responses to their combination found at intermodulation frequencies. The result is a rather rich dataset of frequencies at which responses can be found. We presented pairs of sinusoidal gratings at different temporal frequencies, forming plaid patterns that were \" coherent \" (looking like a checkerboar d) and \" noncoherent \" (looking like a pair of transparently overlaid gratings), and found clear intermodulation responses to compound stimuli, indicating nonlinear summation. This might have been attributed to cross-orientation suppression except that the pattern of intermodulation responses differed for coherent and noncoherent patterns, whereas the effects of suppression (measured at the component frequencies) did not. A two-stage model of nonlinear summation involving conjunction detection with a logical AND gate described the data well, capturing the difference between coherent and noncoherent plaids over a wide array of possible response frequencies. Multistimulus frequency -tagged EEG in combination with computational modeling may be a very valuable tool in studying the conjunction of these signals. In the current study the results suggest a second-order mechanism responding selectively to coherent plaid patterns."}

These results suggested that astrocytes may engage in phagocytic activity during extended wake, but direct evidence was lacking. Studies in humans and rodents also found that sleep loss increases peripheral markers of inflammation, but whether these changes are associated with neuroinflammation and/or activation of microglia, the brain's resident innate immune cells, was unknown. Here we used serial block-face scanning electron microscopy to obtain 3D volume measurements of synapses and surrounding astrocytic processes in mouse frontal cortex after 6-8 h of sleep, spontaneous wake, or sleep deprivation (SD) and after chronic (\u223c5 d) sleep restriction (CSR). Astrocytic phagocytosis, mainly of presynaptic components of large synapses, increased after both acute and chronic sleep loss relative to sleep and wake. MERTK expression and lipid peroxidation in synaptoneurosomes also increased to a similar extent after short and long sleep loss, suggesting that astrocytic phagocytosis may represent the brain's response to the increase in synaptic activity associated with prolonged wake, clearing worn components of heavily used synapses. Using confocal microscopy, we then found that CSR but not SD mice show morphological signs of microglial activation and enhanced microglial phagocytosis of synaptic elements, without obvious signs of neuroinflammation in the CSF. Because low - level sustained microglia activation can lead to abnormal responses to a secondary insult, these results suggest that chronic sleep loss, through microglia priming, may predispose the brain to further damage .SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We find that astrocytic phagocytosis of synaptic elements, mostly of presynaptic origin and in large synapses, is upregulated already after a few hours of sleep deprivation and shows a further significant increase after prolonged and severe sleep loss, suggesting that it may promote the housekeeping of heavily used and strong synapses in response to the increased neuronal activity of extended wake. By contrast, chronic sleep restriction but not acute sleep loss activates microglia, promotes their phagocytic activity, and does so in the absence of overt signs of neuroinflammation, suggesting that like many other stressors, extended sleep disruption may lead to a state of sustained microglia activation, perhaps increasing the brain's susceptibility to other forms of damage."}

Recovering mobility, returning to prefracture activities, and obtaining stable health were the most commonly reported goals. Participants described good social support, access to physiotherapy, and positive perspective as most important to recovery. These factors were influenced by participants ' knowledge, resources, and monthly contact with study staff (perceived as a form of social support).

The results show that Chinese speakers with basic knowledge of English benefited from physical activity while learning a set of new words. Furthermore, their better performance emerged also at the sentential level, as shown by their performance in a Semantic Judgment task.

Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that the addition of non-invasive cardiac index and pulse pressure variation monitoring to mean arterial pressure -based goal-directed therapy would reduce the incidence of postoperative complications in patients having moderate-risk abdominal surgery. In this pragmatic multicentre randomised controlled trial, we randomly allocated 244 patients by envelope drawing in a 1:1 fashion, stratified per centre. All patients had mean arterial pressure, cardiac index and pulse pressure variation measured continuously. In one group, healthcare professionals were blinded to cardiac index and pulse pressure variation values and were asked to guide haemodynamic therapy only based on mean arterial pressure (control group). In the second group, cardiac index and pulse pressure variation values were displayed and kept within target ranges following a pre-defined algorithm (CI-PPV group). The primary endpoint was the incidence of postoperative complications within 30 days. One hundred and seventy-five patients were eligible for final analysis. Overall complication rates were similar (42/94 (44.7%) vs. 38/81 (46.9%) in the control and CI-PPV groups, respectively; p = 0.95). The CI-PPV group had lower mean (SD) pulse pressure variation values (9.5 (2.0)% vs. 11.9 (4.6)%; p = 0.003) and higher mean (SD) cardiac indices (2.76 (0.62) l min(-1) .m(-2) vs. 2.53 (0.66) l min(-1) .m(-2); p = 0.004) than the control group.

Human MSTO1 is a poorly studied protein, suggested to have mitochondrial localization and to regulate morphology and distribution of mitochondria. As for other mutations affecting genes involved in mitochondrial dynamics, no biochemical defects typical of mitochondrial disorders were reported. Studies in patients ' fibroblasts revealed that MSTO1 protein levels were strongly reduced, the mitochondrial network was fragmented and the fusion events among mitochondria were decreased, confirming the deleterious effect of the identified variants and the role of MSTO1 in modulating mitochondrial dynamics.

While diet is known to be an important exposure pathway for HFRs in birds, it has been suggested that exposure through air may represent an underestimated source of HFRs for certain species. However, a method was not available for measuring the atmospheric exposure of individual birds to HFRs or other semi-volatile contaminants. The goal of this study was to develop a bird -borne passive air sampler (PAS) enabling the determination of individual atmospheric exposure to gas - and particle-phase HFRs using the ring-billed gull (Larus delawarensis) nesting in the Montreal area (QC, Canada). The new miniaturized elliptical-shaped PAS (mean weight: 2.72g) was tested using two sorbent types during three exposure periods (one, two and three weeks). Results showed that PAS using polyurethane foam (PUF) combined with a glass fiber filter collected all major polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and exhibited better performance for collecting highly hydrophobic DecaBDE mixture congeners compared to the PAS using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Emerging HFRs including hexabromobenzene, Dechlorane 604 Component B, and Dechlorane plus (DP) isomers also were sampled by the PUF -based PAS. Sampling rates for most HFRs were comparable between the three exposure periods. This novel bird -borne PAS provides valuable information on the non-dietary exposure of free-ranging birds to HFRs."}

Objective To evaluate medication regimen complexity and the prevalence of potentially inappropriate medications before and after admission to hospital. Setting General medical units of a tertiary care hospital in Australia. Methods Retrospective cohort study of patients aged 65 years and above. Medication complexity was measured by using the Medication Regimen Complexity Index (MRCI). Main outcome measure The primary outcome was the change in the Medication Regimen Complexity Index for all prescribed medications after hospitalization. Results A convenience sample of 100 patients was included in the study. There was a significant change in the mean medication complexity score (as measured using the MRCI), increasing from 29 at the time of admission to 32 at the time of discharge (p < 0.05). Factors such as baseline medication regimen complexity (pre-admission MRCI) and length of stay in the hospitals appear to influence the change in medication complexity. However, the proportion of patients prescribed at least one potentially inappropriate medicine (PIM) decreased significantly, from 52% pre-hospitalization to 42% at discharge (p = 0.04). Conclusions Relative to the time of admission, overall medication complexity increased and the proportion of patients who were prescribed PIMs decreased after hospitalisation."}
