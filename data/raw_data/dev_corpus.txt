26797704|t|The Impact of Deployment on Parental, Family and Child Adjustment in Military Families
26797704|a|Since 9/11, military service in the United States has been characterized by wartime deployments and reintegration challenges that contribute to a context of stress for military families. Research indicates the negative impact of wartime deployment on the well being of service members, military spouses, and children. Yet, few studies have considered how parental deployments may affect adjustment in young children and their families. Using deployment records and parent - reported measures from primary caregiving (N = 680) and military (n = 310) parents, we examined the influence of deployment on adjustment in military families with children ages 0-10 years. Greater deployment exposure was related to impaired family functioning and marital instability. Parental depressive and posttraumatic stress symptoms were associated with impairments in social emotional adjustment in young children, increased anxiety in early childhood, and adjustment problems in school-age children. Conversely, parental sensitivity was associated with improved social and emotional outcomes across childhood. These findings provide guidance to developing preventive approaches for military families with young children.

26931495|t|Beyond neutral and forbidden links: morphological matches and the assembly of mutualistic hawkmoth - plant networks
26931495|a|A major challenge in evolutionary ecology is to understand how co-evolutionary processes shape patterns of interactions between species at community level. Pollination of flowers with long corolla tubes by long-tongued hawkmoths has been invoked as a showcase model of co-evolution. Recently, optimal foraging models have predicted that there might be a close association between mouthparts' length and the corolla depth of the visited flowers, thus favouring trait convergence and specialization at community level. Here, we assessed whether hawkmoths more frequently pollinate plants with floral tube lengths similar to their proboscis lengths (morphological match hypothesis) against abundance -based processes (neutral hypothesis) and ecological trait mismatches constraints (forbidden links hypothesis), and how these processes structure hawkmoth - plant mutualistic networks from five communities in four biogeographical regions of South America. We found convergence in morphological traits across the five communities and that the distribution of morphological differences between hawkmoths and plants is consistent with expectations under the morphological match hypothesis in three of the five communities. In the two remaining communities, which are ecotones between two distinct biogeographical areas, interactions are better predicted by the neutral hypothesis. Our findings are consistent with the idea that diffuse co-evolution drives the evolution of extremely long proboscises and flower tubes, and highlight the importance of morphological traits, beyond the forbidden links hypothesis, in structuring interactions between mutualistic partners, revealing that the role of niche-based processes can be much more complex than previously known.

27061776|t|Nosocomial pneumonia caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus treated with linezolid or vancomycin: A secondary economic analysis of resource use from a Spanish perspective
27061776|a|Adopting a unique Spanish perspective, this study aims to assess healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) and the costs of treating nosocomial pneumonia (NP) produced by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in hospitalized adults using linezolid or vancomycin. An evaluation is also made of the renal failure rate and related economic outcomes between study groups. An economic post hoc evaluation of a randomized, double-blind, multicenter phase 4 study was carried out. Nosocomial pneumonia due to MRSA in hospitalized adults. The modified intent to treat (mITT) population comprised 224 linezolid - and 224 vancomycin - treated patients. Costs and HCRU were evaluated between patients administered either linezolid or vancomycin, and between patients who developed renal failure and those who did not. Analysis of HCRU outcomes and costs. Total costs were similar between the linezolid - (€17,782±€9,615) and vancomycin - treated patients (€17,423±€9,460) (P=.69). The renal failure rate was significantly lower in the linezolid - treated patients (4% vs. 15%; P<.001). The total costs tended to be higher in patients who developed renal failure (€19,626±€10,840 vs. €17,388±€9,369; P=.14). Among the patients who developed renal failure, HCRU (days on mechanical ventilation: 13.2±10.7 vs. 7.6±3.6 days; P=.21; ICU stay: 14.4±10.5 vs. 9.9±6.6 days; P=.30; hospital stay: 19.5±9.5 vs. 16.1±11.0 days; P=.26) and cost (€17,219±€8,792 vs. €20,263±€11,350; P=.51) tended to be lower in the linezolid - vs. vancomycin - treated patients. There were no statistically significant differences in costs per patient - day between cohorts after correcting for mortality (€1000 vs. €1,010; P=.98). From a Spanish perspective, there were no statistically significant differences in total costs between the linezolid and vancomycin pneumonia cohorts. The drug cost corresponding to linezolid was partially offset by fewer renal failure adverse events.

27131339|t|HERG1 potassium channel expression in potentially malignant disorders of the oral mucosa and prognostic relevance in oral squamous cell carcinoma
27131339|a|HERG1 potassium channel plays a critical role in the cell proliferation. HERG1 protein expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 62 patients with oral leukoplakias and 100 patients with oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC). HERG1 mRNA levels were assessed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 22 patients with primary head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Statistically significant associations were found between HERG1 expression and tobacco consumption, disease stage, tumor differentiation, tumor recurrence, and reduced survival. There was no association between HERG1 expression and the risk of progression from oral leukoplakia to OSCC. In addition, a high proportion of tumors (80%) showed increased HERG1 mRNA levels compared to normal mucosa from nononcologic patients. Aberrant HERG1 expression increases as oral tumorigenesis progresses from oral hyperplasia to OSCC. Increased HERG1 mRNA levels were also frequently detected in OSCC and other HNSCC subsites. HERG1 expression emerges as a clinically relevant feature during tumor progression and a potential poor prognostic biomarker for OSCC. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 38: 1708-1716, 2016.

27213687|t|Nationwide reduction in the number of corneal transplantations for keratoconus following the implementation of cross-linking
27213687|a|Keratoconus is characterized by corneal ectasia and irregular astigmatism, which can lead to diminished vision and corneal scarring. Approximately 10-20% of patients with keratoconus eventually require a corneal transplant. Corneal cross-linking (CXL) is a relatively new treatment that may help prevent the need for corneal transplantation. Here, we investigated whether the introduction of CXL has reduced the number of corneal transplants performed annually. Data regarding the transplantation procedures performed in patients under the age of 50 years were extracted from the Dutch National Organ Transplant Registry. The number of corneal transplants performed prior to (i.e. in 2005 through 2007) and following the introduction of CXL (i.e. in 2012 through 2014) were compared. Furthermore, a trend analysis on annual keratoplasties over time was performed. Approximately 25% fewer corneal transplants were performed in the 3- year period following the introduction of CXL compared to the 3- year period prior to the introduction of CXL (201 versus 269 transplants, respectively; p = 0.005). Age, gender and visual acuity were similar between the patient groups in the two time periods. Trend analysis also demonstrated a significant decrease in the amount of corneal transplants (p = 0.001). Significantly fewer corneal transplants were performed for treating keratoconus following the nationwide introduction of CXL. This reduction suggests that corneal cross-linking can significantly reduce the need for corneal transplantation.

27233918|t|Basal and maximal metabolic rates differ in their response to rapid temperature change among avian species
27233918|a|In birds, acclimation and acclimatization to temperature are associated with changes in basal (BMR), summit (Msum) and maximal (MMR) metabolic rates but little is known about the rate at which species adjust their phenotype to short-term temperature variations. Our aims were (1) to determine the pattern of metabolic adjustments following a rapid temperature change, (2) to determine whether performance varies at similar rates during exposure to warm or cold environments, and (3) to determine if BMR, Msum and MMR change at comparable rates during thermal acclimation. We measured these parameters in white-throated sparrows (Zonotrichia albicollis), black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus), and snow buntings (Plectrophenax nivalis) after acclimation to 10 °C (day 0) and on the 4th and 8th days of acclimation to either -5 or 28 °C. Birds changed their metabolic phenotype within 8 days with patterns differing among species. Sparrows expressed the expected metabolic increases in the cold and decreases at thermoneutrality while performance in chickadees and buntings was not influenced by temperature but changed over time with inverse patterns. Our results suggest that BMR varies at comparable rates in warm and cold environments but changes faster than Msum and MMR, likely due to limitations in the rate of change in organ size and function. They also suggest that maximal metabolic capacity is lost faster in a warm environment than it is gained in a cold environment. With the expected increase in temperature stochasticity at northern latitudes, a loss of thermogenic capacity during warm winter days could, therefore, be detrimental if birds are slow to readjust their phenotype with the return of cold days.

27235824|t|A prime a day keeps calories away: The effects of supraliminal priming on food consumption and the moderating role of gender and eating restraint
27235824|a|The link between intentions and action in weight control is weaker than previously thought, so recent research has called for further investigation of ways to improve weight control that bypass conscious intentions. Priming has been shown to have effects on individual behavior in a variety of contexts by influencing subconscious cognition. This paper investigates the effects of semantic priming using healthy body image, goal-oriented words on food consumption. The moderating role of both restrained eating and gender is investigated. 161 participants were involved in an experiment using a novel version of a scrambled sentence priming game. The outcome measure was the number of kilocalories consumed, examined using a between subjects ANCOVA with priming, gender, restrained eating index, self-reported BMI, and two interaction terms (priming x gender, and priming x restrained eating index). There was no main effect of priming but there was an interaction of priming with gender. Females consumed significantly fewer kilocalories after being exposed to priming words related to a healthy body image (i.e. "slim", "fit,") compared to females receiving the neutral prime, with a medium effect size (d = 0.58). The body image prime did not significantly affect food intake for males, nor did it have a differential effect on restrained eaters. This study shows that priming can be an effective method for influencing females to reduce food intake, regardless of whether they are restrained or unrestrained eaters. Future studies could investigate whether different priming words related to a male's healthy body image goal (i.e. "buff," " muscles ," etc.) would similarly reduce food intake for males.

27235870|t|Neurotrophins and specific receptors in the oviduct tracts of Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica)
27235870|a|Neurotrophins (NGF, BDNF and NT-3) and their specific receptors (TrkA, TrkB and TrkC) were studied in the oviduct of egg laying quails. Neurotrophins (NTs) are mainly involved in the development and maintenance of neuronal populations in the central and peripheral nervous system, but also in reproductive system. In this survey, we first studied the morphological organization of the quail oviduct, distinguished in infundibulum, magnum, isthmus, uterus and vagina, and then we analyzed the expression and localization of NTs and Trks receptors in the whole tracts. By western blotting we detected that the investigated NTs and Trks receptors are expressed in all oviductal tracts. By immunohistochemistry we were able to define the distribution of NTs and Trks. Specifically, NGF, BDNF and NT3 were localized in lining and ductal epithelial cells, and NGF was also detected in secretory cells of tubular glands and in nervous fibers of vessel wall. TrkA and TrkB were present in the lining and ductal epithelium; TrkA and TrkC were present in nervous fibers of vessel wall in all oviductal tracts. Furthermore, we also observed NGF and BDNF co-localized with TrkA and TrkB in cells of the lining and ductal epithelium, suggesting an autocrine mechanism of action.

27236097|t|The influence of liposomal formulation on the incorporation and retention of PNA oligomers
27236097|a|Liposomal formulations composed of phospholipids with different unsaturation degrees, head groups and at different cholesterol content have been tested for the encapsulation of Peptide Nucleic Acid (PNA) oligomers. The best loading capability (177μg, ER %=87.2) was obtained for pure liposomes of phosphatidylglycerol (DOPG) with negatively charged head group. The insertion of a 10-20% of cholesterol in DOPG based liposomes provides a slight decrease (∼160μg) of the PNA loading. On the other hand, the cholesterol addition (20-30%) slows down the PNA's release (∼27%) in fetal bovine serum from the liposomal formulation. Based on the encapsulation and the release properties, PEGylated DOPG liposomes with a percentage of cholesterol of 10-20% are the optimal formulation for the loading of PNA-a210.

27236780|t|Histopathology of the filum terminale in children with and without tethered cord syndrome with attention to the elastic tissue within the filum
27236780|a|To compare histologically transected fila from pediatric patients with tethered cord syndrome (TCS), with and without a low conus, with controls, focusing on collagenous and elastic tissue. Thirty fila from patients with TCS, including 5 where minimal cautery was used prior to filum section, were compared with fila from 27 pediatric cadavers without TCS (controls). Sections of fila were stained with H&E, Masson trichrome and Verhoeff von Gieson elastic stains, and 7 with Gordon and Sweet's reticulin stain. Fila from controls showed loose fibrous connective tissue (FCT) with thin and evenly dispersed elastic fibers (EFs). Reticulin fibers (RFs) were seen in blood vessel walls and nerve twigs. Fat was identified microscopically in 2 fila. All fila from patients with TCS had dense FCT. The EFs were in normal numbers in 17, and focally or diffusely decreased in 13. All 25 patients where the fila were cauterized during resection had thick and coiled EFs. Coiling was not seen when minimal cautery was applied. RFs were seen in blood vessel walls and nerve twigs. Fat was identified in 19 patients. Findings were similar, whether the conus termination was normal or low. The fila of all patients with TCS, whether or not the conus was low, showed abnormal FCT. EFs were decreased in 48 % of patients; however, there were thick and coiled EFs in all patients. Coiling of EFs, initially thought to be an abnormality in patients, is considered most likely to be a result of cautery (i.e., artifactual / iatrogenic coiling).

27237301|t|Clinical value of pathologic examination of non-neoplastic kidney in patients with upper urinary tract malignancies
27237301|a|While surgical resection remains the standard of care in the treatment of upper urinary tract malignancies, nephrectomy is a risk factor for the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The aim of this study was to determine whether histologic evaluation of non-neoplastic kidney could enable early identification of unrecognized kidney disease and could be of prognostic value in predicting postoperative renal outcomes. We retrospectively analyzed 51 patients with upper urinary tract malignancies who received uninephrectomy or uninephroureterectomy. A thorough pathologic evaluation of non-neoplastic kidney including special stains, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopic studies was performed. The degree of parenchymal changes was graded from 0 to 15. Of 51 patients, only 13 showed normal kidney pathology. Fifteen patients showed glomerular abnormalities, 14 showed diabetic nephropathy, and 11 showed vascular nephropathy. There was one case each of reflux nephropathy and chronic pyelonephritis. The median histologic score was 5 points. Only 25.4% of patients had ≤ 3 points. Score more than 5 was observed in 47.1% of patients. Postoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at 3 to 36 months were obtained from 90.2% of patients, and of those, 34.8% had de novo CKD. Since no one had CKD in partial nephrectomized patients, we determined risk factors for CKD in radical nephrectomized patients. Cox regression analysis revealed that postoperative AKI, preoperative eGFR, and histologic score of non-neoplastic kidney were the independent predictors for CKD. We conclude that routine pathologic evaluation of non-neoplastic kidney provides valuable diagnostic and prognostic information.

27239027|t|Concordant but Varied Phenotypes among Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Patient -Specific Myoblasts Derived using a Human iPSC -Based Model
27239027|a|Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) remains an intractable genetic disease. Althogh there are several animal models of DMD, there is no human cell model that carries patient -specific DYSTROPHIN mutations. Here, we present a human DMD model using human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). Our model reveals concordant disease - related phenotypes with patient - dependent variation, which are partially reversed by genetic and pharmacological approaches. Our " chemical-compound -based" strategy successfully directs hiPSCs into expandable myoblasts, which exhibit a myogenic transcriptional program, forming striated contractile myofibers and participating in muscle regeneration in vivo. DMD - hiPSC -derived myoblasts show disease - related phenotypes with patient -to- patient variability, including aberrant expression of inflammation or immune-response genes and collagens, increased BMP / TGFβ signaling, and reduced fusion competence. Furthermore, by genetic correction and pharmacological "dual- SMAD " inhibition, the DMD - hiPSC -derived myoblasts and genetically corrected isogenic myoblasts form "rescued" multi - nucleated myotubes. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate the feasibility of establishing a human " DMD -in-a-dish" model using hiPSC -based disease modeling.

27239445|t|SNAI1 promotes the development of HCC through the enhancement of proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis
27239445|a|SNAI1, a zinc-finger transcription factor, plays an important role in the induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in various cancers. However, the possible functions of SNAI1 in the proliferation and apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma have not been clearly identified. In this study, we investigated the effects and mechanisms of SNAI1 in the proliferation and apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma using clinical samples and cell lines. We found that SNAI1 is highly expressed in the tissues of liver cancer compared with adjacent nontumor tissues. SNAI1 is also highly expressed in the hepatoma cell lines HepG2, SMMC-7721, and BEL-7402 compared with the human normal liver cell line L02. We also observed that SNAI1 expression was correlated with distal metastasis, incomplete tumor capsule formation, and histological differentiation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Moreover, we demonstrated that knockdown of SNAI1 via lentiviral vectors of RNAi against SNAI inhibited cell proliferation by inducing G1 arrest, which was accompanied by the downregulation of cyclin D1 but not that of cyclin A. In addition, knockdown of SNAI1 promoted apoptosis by decreasing the expression of Bcl-2. In conclusion, our findings revealed that SNAI1 is involved in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma via regulating the growth and apoptosis of tumor cells.

27240257|t|Quantitative assessment of fluorescent proteins
27240257|a|The advent of fluorescent proteins (FPs) for genetic labeling of molecules and cells has revolutionized fluorescence microscopy. Genetic manipulations have created a vast array of bright and stable FPs spanning blue to red spectral regions. Common to autofluorescent FPs is their tight β-barrel structure, which provides the rigidity and chemical environment needed for effectual fluorescence. Despite the common structure, each FP has unique properties. Thus, there is no single 'best' FP for every circumstance, and each FP has advantages and disadvantages. To guide decisions about which FP is right for a given application, we have quantitatively characterized the brightness, photostability, pH stability and monomeric properties of more than 40 FPs to enable straightforward and direct comparison between them. We focus on popular and/or top-performing FPs in each spectral region.

27240560|t|Consumption of fruits and vegetables associated with other risk behaviors among adolescents in Northeast Brazil
27240560|a|To determine the prevalence of consumption of fruits and vegetables and identify the association with low level of physical activity, exposure to sedentary behavior, consumption of soft drinks and overweight / obesity in adolescents. This is a cross-sectional school-based study with a representative sample of 3992 students aged 14-19 years from the state of Sergipe, Brazil. The outcome was low consumption of fruits and vegetables (<5 servings/day). Independent variables were: level of physical activity, sedentary behavior, consumption of soft drinks, and overweight / obesity. Global Student Health Survey questionnaire and body mass and height measurements were used, as well as chi-square test and crude and adjusted binary logistic regression. The significance level adopted was 5%. The prevalence of inadequate consumption of fruits and vegetables was high - 88.6% (95% CI =87.6-89.5). Higher likelihood of low consumption of fruits and vegetables was verified among boys who were exposed to sedentary behavior (OR =1.63; 95% CI =1.18-2.24), who consumed soft drinks (OR =3.04; 95% CI =2.10-4.40), with insufficiently physical activity (OR =1.98; 95% CI =1.43-2.73) and girls who consumed soft drinks (OR =1.88; 95% CI =1.43-2.47) and those with overweight / obesity (OR =1.63; 95% CI =1.19-2.23). There is a need of public policies aimed at encouraging the consumption of healthy foods among adolescents.

27242761|t|Cobalamin Protection against Oxidative Stress in the Acidophilic Iron-oxidizing Bacterium Leptospirillum Group II CF-1
27242761|a|Members of the genus Leptospirillum are aerobic iron-oxidizing bacteria belonging to the phylum Nitrospira. They are important members of microbial communities that catalyze the biomining of sulfidic ores, thereby solubilizing metal ions. These microorganisms live under extremely acidic and metal -loaded environments and thus must tolerate high concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Cobalamin (vitamin B12) is a cobalt -containing tetrapyrrole cofactor involved in intramolecular rearrangement reactions and has recently been suggested to be an intracellular antioxidant. In this work, we investigated the effect of the exogenous addition of cobalamin on oxidative stress parameters in Leptospirillum group II strain CF-1. Our results revealed that the external supplementation of cobalamin reduces the levels of intracellular ROSs and the damage to biomolecules, and also stimulates the growth and survival of cells exposed to oxidative stress exerted by ferric ion, hydrogen peroxide, chromate and diamide. Furthermore, exposure of strain CF-1 to oxidative stress elicitors resulted in the transcriptional activation of the cbiA gene encoding CbiA of the cobalamin biosynthetic pathway. Altogether, these data suggest that cobalamin plays an important role in redox protection of Leptospirillum strain CF-1, supporting survival of this microorganism under extremely oxidative environmental conditions. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the protective effect of cobalamin against oxidative stress may help to develop strategies to make biomining processes more effective.

27244222|t|A longitudinal study assessing childcare services' adoption of obesity prevention policies and practices
27244222|a|Despite ongoing investments to improve the obesogenic environments of childcare settings, little is known regarding how these services have changed their physical activity and nutrition-promoting practices. This study aims to describe changes in the proportion of Australian childcare services that have adopted best-practice healthy eating and physical activity practices between 2006 and 2013 and to assess whether adoption varied by socio-economic status and locality. A randomly selected sample of nominated supervisors (n = 358) from childcare services located in New South Wales, Australia, participated in a telephone survey in 2006, 2009, 2010 and 2013. Supervisors reported on their service's adoption of six practices: (i) having written nutrition and physical activity policies; (ii) staff trained in physical activity and nutrition in the past year; (iii) scheduled time for fundamental movement skills and (iv) outdoor play; (v) weekly or less screen time opportunitie s; and (vi) serving only non-sweetened beverages. A significant increase in the prevalence of services adopting all but one practice, between 2006 and 2013 was identified. Ninety one percent of services adopted four or more practices, a significant increase from 38% in 2006. There were no differences in the proportion of services adopting each practice by locality and socio-economic status. Government investment in obesity prevention programmes can equitably improve childcare service's adoption of healthy eating and physical activity promoting practices on a jurisdiction -wide basis. The establishment of a routine system to monitor adoption of a broader range of practices by childcare services is warranted.

27247892|t|Isolation and characterization of Burkholderia sp. strain CCA53 exhibiting ligninolytic potential
27247892|a|Microbial degradation of lignin releases fermentable sugars, effective utilization of which could support biofuel production from lignocellulosic biomass. In the present study, a lignin-degrading bacterium was isolated from leaf soil and identified as Burkholderia sp. based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing. This strain was named CCA53, and its lignin-degrading capability was assessed by observing its growth on medium containing alkali lignin or lignin -associated aromatic monomers as the sole carbon source. Alkali lignin and at least eight lignin -associated aromatic monomers supported growth of this strain, and the most effective utilization was observed for p-hydroxybenzene monomers. These findings indicate that Burkholderia sp. strain CCA53 has fragmentary activity for lignin degradation.

27250823|t|Diagnostic utility of additional conventional techniques after endobronchial ultrasonography guidance during transbronchial biopsy
27250823|a|Endobronchial ultrasonography with a guide sheath transbronchial biopsy (EBUS - GS TBB) has been used to diagnose peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPLs). In this study, we evaluated the diagnostic utility of conventional TBB after EBUS - GS TBB. A retrospective analysis of patients who underwent conventional TBB after EBUS - GS TBB for PPL between August 1, 2012 and December 31, 2014. We performed multivariate analysis to examine the association of various clinical factors, including EBUS probe distance and sample size area, with diagnostic yield. Of 88 eligible patients, 57 (65%) were successfully diagnosed by EBUS - GS TBB. In 31 patients not diagnosed by EBUS - GS TBB, 15 (48%) were successfully diagnosed by additional conventional TBB. Ground glass opacity (GGO) was a significant factor associated with the diagnostic yield of additional conventional TBB following EBUS - GS TBB. Multivariate analysis and receiver operator curves revealed that distance between the PPL and the EBUS probe of less than 2.55 mm favored the utility of conventional TBB. Additional conventional TBB after EBUS - GS TBB could be a useful procedure for the diagnosis of ground glass opacity PPLs and in cases of a distance of less than 2.55 mm between the EBUS probe and the lesion.

27251117|t|Active diffusion and microtubule-based transport oppose myosin forces to position organelles in cells
27251117|a|Even distribution of peroxisomes (POs) and lipid droplets (LDs) is critical to their role in lipid and reactive oxygen species homeostasis. How even distribution is achieved remains elusive, but diffusive motion and directed motility may play a role. Here we show that in the fungus Ustilago maydis ~95% of POs and LDs undergo diffusive motions. These movements require ATP and involve bidirectional early endosome motility, indicating that microtubule - associated membrane trafficking enhances diffusion of organelles. When early endosome transport is abolished, POs and LDs drift slowly towards the growing cell end. This pole-ward drift is facilitated by anterograde delivery of secretory cargo to the cell tip by myosin-5. Modelling reveals that microtubule-based directed transport and active diffusion support distribution, mobility and mixing of POs. In mammalian COS-7 cells, microtubules and F-actin also counteract each other to distribute POs. This highlights the importance of opposing cytoskeletal forces in organelle positioning in eukaryotes.

27251918|t|The role of catheter ablation in the management of atrial fibrillation
27251918|a|Atrial fibrillation is driven by spontaneous electrical activation emerging from the pulmonary veins. Catheter ablation using either radiofrequency or cryothermal energy electrically isolates these veins from the left atrium, both reducing the burden of atrial fibrillation episodes and improving the patient's symptoms. Catheter ablation is superior to antiarryhthmic drugs when patients are carefully selected. Underlying medical problems - including obesity, hypertension and obstructive sleep apnoea - should be optimally treated before considering ablation. Although this treatment has the potential to cure patients of their symptoms, they should be aware of the important associated procedural complications.

27252074|t|The Chinese Herbal Mixture Tien-Hsien Liquid Augments the Anticancer Immunity in Tumor Cell - Vaccinated Mice
27252074|a|Background The Chinese herbal mixture, Tien-Hsien liquid (THL), has been used as an anticancer dietary supplement for more than 20 years. Our previous studies have shown that THL can modulate immune response and inhibit tumor growth. In this study, we further evaluated the effect of THL on anticancer immune response in mice vaccinated with γ-ray - irradiated tumor cells. Methods The antitumor effect of THL was determined in mice vaccinated with low-tumorigenic CT-26-low colon cancer cells or γ-ray-irradiated high-tumorigenic CT-26-high colon cancer cells. The number of natural killer (NK) cells and T lymphocytes in the spleen was analyzed by flow cytometry. The tumor - killing activities of NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) were analyzed by flow cytometry using YAC-1 and CT-26-high cells, respectively, as target cells. The levels of IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α were determined by ELISA. Results THL suppressed the growth of CT-26-high tumor in mice previously vaccinated with low-tumorigenic CT-26-low cells or γ-irradiated CT-26-high cells. THL increased the populations of NK cells and CD4+ T lymphocytes in the spleen and enhanced the tumor - killing activities of NK cells and CTL in mice vaccinated with γ-irradiated CT-26-high cells. THL increased the production of IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α in mice vaccinated with γ-irradiated CT-26-high cells. Conclusion THL can enhance the antitumor immune responses in mice vaccinated with killed tumor cells. These results suggest that THL may be used as a complementary medicine for cancer patients previously treated with killed tumor cell vaccines, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy.

27252721|t|Timing of False Ring Formation in Pinus halepensis and Arbutus unedo in Southern Italy: Outlook from an Analysis of Xylogenesis and Tree-Ring Chronologies
27252721|a|Mediterranean tree rings are characterized by intra-annual density fluctuations (IADFs) due to partly climate-driven cambial activity. IADFs are used as structural signals to gain information on relations between environmental conditions and eco-physiological processes during xylogenesis, with intra-annual resolution. To reach an unbiased synchronization of the IADF position within tree rings and seasonal fluctuations in environmental conditions, it is necessary to know the timing of cambial activity and wood formation, which are species- and site-specific processes. We applied the microcoring technique to analyze xylogenesis in Pinus halepensis and Arbutus unedo. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to study xylogenesis in a hardwood species forming frequent IADFs. Both species co-occur at a site in southern Italy characterized by a Mediterranean climate. To facilitate tree-ring dating and identification of IADFs, we performed traditional dendroecological analysis. We analyzed xylogenesis during summer, which is considered a constraint for xylogenesis and a trigger for IADF formation. We followed the different phases of cell development in the current wood increment with the aim of evaluating whether and which type of IADFs were formed. We additionally analyzed the same phases again in September and in winter to verify the possible formation of IADFs in fall and whether cell production and differentiation was completed by the end of the calendar year. Both species formed the same type of IADFs (earlywood -like cells within latewood), due to temporary growth restoration triggered by rain events during the period of summer drought. At the end of the calendar year, no cells in the phases of enlargement and secondary cell wall deposition occurred. A. unedo was more sensitive than P. halepensis because IADF s were formed earlier in the season and were more frequent in the tree-ring series. The dendro-anatomical approach, combining analysis of tree-ring series and of xylogenesis, helped to detect the period of IADF formation in the two species. Results are discussed in functional terms, highlighting the environmental conditions triggering IADFs, and also in methodological terms, evaluating the applicability of xylogenesis analysis in Mediterranean woods, especially when the formation of IADFs is not uniform around the stem.

27254792|a|Family Medicine (FM) is a new specialty in Ethiopia. The first seven family physicians graduated in February 2016 from the inaugural residency programme at Addis Ababa University. Cooperation amongst Ethiopian and expatriate decision-makers and physicians was needed to begin the programme. Intentional replacement of expatriates with Ethiopian family physicians has begun. Barriers include lack of understanding of FM and the human and financial resources needed for scaling up the programme. Regular programme review with resident physician involvement has allowed the FM training programme to adapt and fit the Ethiopian context. Further successes will result from ongoing support and advocacy from the Federal Ministry of Health and other Ethiopian, African, and international primary care organisations.

27256947|t|The Experience of Women Veterans Coming Back from War
27256947|a|Issues surrounding mental health are common for women veterans who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan wars. The goal of this phenomenological study was to document themes in the stories gathered from eight women veterans who had come back from war. Themes in the stories were: arriving with mixed sentiments; evolving to a changed view of self; permeating aggravation; confounding broken relationships, frequent deployments, and change in military status; remembering war experiences; and seeking opportunity for what is possible. Mental health issues can be observed in the themes. Including story as part of the mental health visit with veterans may be beneficial to veterans as they deal with the transition of coming back.

27257353|t|Trajectories of Health and Behavioral Health Services Use among Community Corrections -Involved Rural Adults
27257353|a|This article seeks to establish time-based trajectories of health and behavioral health services utilization for community corrections-involved (CCI) adults and to examine demographic and clinical correlates associated with these trajectories. To accomplish this aim, the authors applied a latent class growth analysis (LCGA) to services use data from a sample of rural CCI adults who reported their medical, mental health, and substance use treatment utilization behavior every 60 days for 1.5 years. LCGA established 1.5-year trajectories and demographic correlates of health services among rural CCI adults. For medical services, three classes emerged (stable-low users, 13%; stable-intermediate users, 40%; and stable-high users, 47%). For mental health and substance use services, three classes emerged (stable-low, 69% and 61%, respectively; low-baseline-increase, 10% and 12%, respectively; high-baseline decline, 21% and 28%, respectively). Employment, gender, medication usage, and depression severity predicted membership across all services. Results underscore the importance of social workers and other community services providers aligning health services access with the needs of the CCI population, and highlight CCI adults as being at risk of underservice in critical prevention and intervention domains.

27257613|t|Data set of interactomes and metabolic pathways of proteins differentially expressed in brains with Alzheimer׳s disease
27257613|a|Alzheimer׳s disease is one of the main causes of dementia in the elderly and its frequency is on the rise worldwide. It is considered the result of complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors, being many of them unknown. Therefore, there is a dire necessity for the identification of novel molecular players for the understanding of this disease. In this data article we determined the protein expression profiles of whole protein extracts from cortex regions of brains from patients with Alzheimer׳s disease in comparison to a normal brain. We identified 721 iTRAQ-labeled polypeptides with more than 95% in confidence. We analyzed all proteins that changed in their expression level and located them in the KEGG metabolic pathways, as well as in the mitochondrial complexes of the electron transport chain and ATP synthase. In addition, we analyzed the over- and sub-expressed polypeptides through IPA software, specifically Core I and Biomarkers I modules. Data in this article is related to the research article "Identification of proteins that are differentially expressed in brains with Alzheimer's disease using iTRAQ labeling and tandem mass spectrometry " (Minjarez et al., 2016) [1].

27257694|t|Emergency general surgery specific frailty index: A validation study
27257694|a|Assessment of operative risk in geriatric patients undergoing emergency general surgery (EGS) is challenging. Frailty is an established measure for risk assessment in surgical cases. The aim of our study was to validate a modified 15 variable emergency general surgery specific frailty index (EGSFI). We prospectively collected geriatric (age > 65) emergency general surgery patients for 1- year. Post-operative complications were collected. Frailty Index was calculated for 200 patients based on their pre-admission condition using 50- variable modified Rockwood Frailty Index (FI). EGSFI was developed based on the regression model for complications and the most significant factors in the FI. ROC curve analysis was performed to determine cutoff for frail status. We validated our results using 60 patients for predicting complications. A total of 260 patients (200 developing, 60 Validation) were enrolled in this study. Mean age was 71 ± 11 years, and 33% developed complications. Most common complications were pneumonia (12%), UTI (9%), and wound infection (7%). Univariate analysis identified 15 variables significantly associated with complications that were used to develop the EGSFI. A cutoff frailty score of 0.325 was identified using ROC curve analysis for frail status .Sixty- patients (frail: 18, non-frail: 42) were enrolled in the validation cohort. Frail patients were more likely to have post-operative complications (47% vs. 20%, p < 0.001) compared to nonfrail patients. Frail status based on EGSFI was a significant predictor of post-operative complications (OR =7.3, 95% CI = 1.7 - 19.8; p=0.006). Age was not associated with postoperative complications (OR =0.99, 95% CI = 0.92 -1.06; p=0.86). The 15- variable validated EGSFI is a simple and reliable bedside tool to determine the frailty status of patients undergoing emergency general surgery. Frail status as determined by Abstract the EGSFI is an independent predictor of post-operative complications and mortality in geriatric emergency general surgery patients.

27257822|t|Comparative Epidemiologic Characteristics of Pertussis in 10 Central and Eastern European Countries, 2000-2013
27257822|a|We undertook an epidemiological survey of the annual incidence of pertussis reported from 2000 to 2013 in ten Central and Eastern European countries to ascertain whether increased pertussis reports in some countries share common underlying drivers or whether there are specific features in each country. The annual incidence of pertussis in the participating countries was obtained from relevant government institutions and/or national surveillance systems. We reviewed the changes in the pertussis incidence rates in each country to explore differences and/or similarities between countries in relation to pertussis surveillance; case definitions for detection and confirmation of pertussis; incidence and number of cases of pertussis by year, overall and by age group; population by year, overall and by age group; pertussis immunization schedule and coverage, and switch from whole-cell pertussis vaccines (wP) to acellular pertussis vaccines (aP). There was heterogeneity in the reported annual incidence rates and trends observed across countries. Reported pertussis incidence rates varied considerably, ranging from 0.01 to 96 per 100,000 population, with the highest rates generally reported in Estonia and the lowest in Hungary and Serbia. The greatest burden appears for the most part in infants (<1 year) in Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Romania, and Serbia, but not in the other participating countries where the burden may have shifted to older children, though surveillance of adults may be inappropriate. There was no consistent pattern associated with the switch from wP to aP vaccines on reported pertussis incidence rates. The heterogeneity in reported data may be related to a number of factors including surveillance system characteristics or capabilities, different case definitions, type of pertussis confirmation tests used, public awareness of the disease, as well as real differences in the magnitude of the disease, or a combination of these factors. Our study highlights the need to standardize pertussis detection and confirmation in surveillance programs across Europe, complemented with carefully-designed seroprevalence studies using the same protocols and methodologies.

27265654|t|Conservation education and habitat restoration for the endangered Sagalla caecilian (Boulengerula niedeni) in Sagalla Hill, Kenya
27265654|a|The Sagalla caecilian (Boulengerula niedeni) is an endangered amphibian endemic to Sagalla Hill in the Taita Hills. This burrowing worm -like species prefers soft soil with high moisture and organic matter. The major threats to the Sagalla caecilian are soil erosion caused by steep slopes, bare ground and water siphoning / soil hardening from exotic eucalyptus trees. The purpose of this study was to get a better understanding of the local people's attitude towards this species and how they can contribute to its continued conservation through restoration of its remaining habitat. In this study, it was found that 96% of Sagalla people are aware of the species, its habits and its association with soils high in organic matter. It was also found that 96% of Sagalla people use organic manure from cow dung in their farms. Habitat restoration through planting of indigenous plants was found to be ongoing, especially on compounds of public institutions as well as on private lands. Although drought was found to be a challenge for seedlings development especially on the low elevation sites, destruction by livestock especially during the dry season is also a major threat. In this study, it was recommended that any future habitat restoration initiative should include strong chain-link fencing to protect the seedlings from livestock activity. Recognizing that the preferred habitats for the species are in the valleys, systematic planting of keystone plant species such as fig trees (Ficus) creates the best microhabitats. These are better than general woodlots of indigenous trees.

27266753|t|The clinical and economic burden of significant bleeding during lung resection surgery: A retrospective matched cohort analysis of real - world data
27266753|a|The objective of this retrospective study was to quantify the clinical and economic burden of significant bleeding in lung resection surgery in the US. This study utilized 2009-2012 data from the Premier Perspective Database(TM). Adult patients with primary pulmonary lobectomy or segmentectomy procedures were categorized by the surgical approach (VATS vs open) and primary diagnosis (primary or metastatic lung cancer vs non-lung cancer). Patients requiring ≥3 units of blood products with at least 1 unit of PRBCs: " significant bleeding " cohort; those requiring <3 units: " non-significant bleeding " cohort; and those not requiring blood products: " no bleeding " cohort. A matched cohort analysis was performed between the " significant bleeding " and the " no bleeding cohort " using matching variables: hospital, lung cancer diagnosis, year of surgery, APR-DRG severity score, procedure type and approach, age, and gender. The " All - patient " cohort comprised 21,429 patients: 213 " significant bleeding "; 2,780 " non-significant bleeding "; and 18,436 " no bleeding ". Overall incidence of significant chest bleeding was 0.99%. Patients from " significant bleeding " cohort and " non-significant bleeding " cohort had 2.5 days and 2 days (p < 0.0001) longer length of stay in the hospital compared to those in the " no bleeding " cohort, respectively. Overall, hospital costs for " significant bleeding " cohort were higher than " no bleeding " cohort for those who were covered under Medicare ($59,871 vs $23,641), were ≥76 years of age ($64,010 vs $24,243), had greater severity of illness ($97,813 vs $51,871) and underwent open segmentectomy ($74,220 vs $21,903). Hospital costs for " significant bleeding " cohort and " non-significant bleeding " were significantly higher ($11,589 and $5,280, respectively, p < 0.0001) than no bleeding cohort. Although significant bleeding during lung resection surgery is rare, patients with such complication could stay longer at the hospital and cost an average of $13,103 more than those without.

27266840|t|Laceration of a branch of the profunda femoris artery caused by a spike of the displaced lesser trochanter in an inter-trochanteric femoral fracture. A case report
27266840|a|Injury of femoral vessels is an extremely rare complication in intertrochanteric femoral fractures. In most cases reported, the vascular lesion involves the superficial femoral artery, whereas in very few cases does it involve the profunda femoris artery. We report a case of acute bleeding due to laceration of a perforating branch of the profunda femoris artery caused by a sharp fragment of the displaced lesser trochanter in an intertrochanteric femoral fracture; the lesion was treated by transcatheter embolization. The arterial injury may be iatrogenic, occurring during intramedullary internal fixation, or less frequently, the injury may be due to the fracture itself, caused by a sharp bone fragment that damages the profunda femoris artery or one of its perforating branches. We believe that intertrochanteric femoral fractures with avulsed lesser trochanter are at risk for femoral vessel injuries caused by the displaced bone spike, and we advise meticulous clinical and laboratory monitoring pre- and post-operatively to prevent serious complications.

27270311|t|Direct contact with perivascular tumor cells enhances integrin αvβ3 signaling and migration of endothelial cells
27270311|a|The secretion of soluble pro-angiogenic factors by tumor cells and stromal cells in the perivascular niche promotes the aggressive angiogenesis that is typical of glioblastoma (GBM). Here, we show that angiogenesis also can be promoted by a direct interaction between brain tumor cells, including tumor cells with cancer stem -like properties (CSCs), and endothelial cells (ECs). As shown in vitro, this direct interaction is mediated by binding of integrin αvβ3 expressed on ECs to the RGD-peptide in L1CAM expressed on CSCs. It promotes both EC network formation and enhances directed migration toward basic fibroblast growth factor. Activation of αvβ3 and bone marrow tyrosine kinase on chromosome X (BMX) is required for migration stimulated by direct binding but not for migration stimulated by soluble factors. RGD-peptide treatment of mice with established intracerebral GBM xenografts significantly reduced the percentage of Sox2 -positive tumor cells and CSCs in close proximity to ECs, decreased integrin αvβ3 and BMX activation and p130CAS phosphorylation in the ECs, and reduced the vessel surface area. These results reveal a previously unrecognized aspect of the regulation of angiogenesis in GBM that can impact therapeutic anti-angiogenic targeting.

27270753|t|The use of Ocimum americanum essential oil against the pathogens Aeromonas hydrophila and Gyrodactylus sp. in silver catfish (Rhamdia quelen)
27270753|a|The bactericidal activity (MIC-test) of Ocimum americanum (inflorescences) essential oil (OAEO) against Aeromonas hydrophila was determined in this study. It was also investigated the potential of OAEO and the main compound found in the oil (linalool) at subinhibitory concentrations to be inhibitors of hemolysis caused by Aer. hydrophila in fish erythrocytes. An in vivo experiment was conducted to evaluate survival of fish (Rhamdia quelen) experimentally infected with Aer. hydrophila and exposed to OAEO. A second experiment was conducted to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo activity of OAEO (mix from inflorescences and leaves) against the parasite Gyrodactylus sp. The OAEO showed weak in vitro activity against Aer. hydrophila (6400 μg ml(-1)). At subinhibitory concentrations OAEO (100 μg ml(-1)) inhibited hemolysis (90%) caused by Aer. hydrophila in fish erythrocytes, however, linalool did not present hemolysis inhibition activity. At low concentrations (10 and 20 mg l(-1)) added to the water OAEO promoted survival of experimentally infected fish with Aer. hydrophila. Lastly, OAEO -mix (50 mg l(-1)) was effective against Gyrodactylus sp. significantly reducing (60%) the number of parasites in the fish. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

27271770|t|Interleukin-1β induced Stress Granules Sequester COX-2 mRNA and Regulates its Stability and Translation in Human OA Chondrocytes
27271770|a|Enhanced and immediate expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) mRNA is observed in IL-1β - stimulated OA chondrocytes but the synthesis of protein found significantly delayed. Here we investigated the role of stress granules (SGs), ribonucleoprotein complexes that regulate mRNA translation, in the delayed translation of COX-2 mRNAs in IL-1β - stimulated OA chondrocytes. Stimulation of human chondrocytes with IL-1β activated the stress response genes and the phosphorylation of eIF2α that triggered the assembly of SGs. Using combined immunofluorescence staining of SGs markers and COX-2 protein, RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization and RNA immunoprecipitation, the COX-2 mRNAs were found sequestered in SGs in IL-1β - stimulated OA chondrocytes. No increase in COX-2 protein expression was observed during the persistence of SGs but enhanced expression of COX-2 protein was noted upon clearance of the SGs. Inhibition of SGs clearance blocked COX-2 mRNA translation whereas blocking the assembly of SGs by TIA-1 depletion resulted in rapid and increased production of COX-2 and PGE2. Our findings show for the first time assembly of SGs and sequestration of COX-2 mRNAs in human OA chondrocytes under pathological conditions. Post-transcriptional regulation of COX-2 mRNAs translation by SGs indicates a role in IL-1β -mediated catabolic response that could be therapeutically targeted in OA.

27271969|t|Spatio-Temporal Distribution of Bark and Ambrosia Beetles in a Brazilian Tropical Dry Forest
27271969|a|Bark and the ambrosia beetles dig into host plants and live most of their lives in concealed tunnels. We assessed beetle community dynamics in tropical dry forest sites in early, intermediate, and late successional stages, evaluating the influence of resource availability and seasonal variations in guild structure. We collected a total of 763 beetles from 23 species, including 14 bark beetle species, and 9 ambrosia beetle species. Local richness of bark and ambrosia beetles was estimated at 31 species. Bark and ambrosia composition was similar over the successional stages gradient, and beta diversity among sites was primarily determined by species turnover, mainly in the bark beetle community. Bark beetle richness and abundance were higher at intermediate stages; availability of wood was the main spatial mechanism. Climate factors were effectively non-seasonal. Ambrosia beetles were not influenced by successional stages, however the increase in wood resulted in increased abundance. We found higher richness at the end of the dry and wet seasons, and abundance increased with air moisture and decreased with higher temperatures and greater rainfall. In summary, bark beetle species accumulation was higher at sites with better wood production, while the needs of fungi (host and air moisture), resulted in a favorable conditions for species accumulation of ambrosia. The overall biological pattern among guilds differed from tropical rain forests, showing patterns similar to dry forest areas.

27272784|t|Detection and Characterization of Flat Aberrant Crypt Foci (Flat ACF) in the Novel A/J Min/+ Mouse
27272784|a|Flat aberrant crypt foci (flat ACF) and mucin-depleted foci (MDF) have previously been described as preneoplastic colonic lesions. We used the novel A/J Min/+ mouse model, that demonstrates extensive spontaneous colon carcinogenesis to refine the method of detection of flat ACF and further characterize and define them as early lesions by histological examination and comparison with MDF. Colons were stained with methylene blue (MB) for flat ACF detection and restained with high-iron diamine-alcian blue (HID-AB) for MDF detection. Optimal flat ACF recognition required at least 24 h of storage post- MB staining and adherence to a set of characteristics. The fraction of flat ACF corresponding with MDF was 93%. Flat ACF / MDF displayed the same picture of severe dysplasia, lack of mucus and goblet cells and accumulation of cytoplasmic β-catenin. The easily detectable flat ACF are reliable surface biomarkers of Apc -driven colon carcinogenesis.

27273160|t|Transcriptional enhancement of Smn levels in motoneurons is crucial for proper axon morphology in zebrafish
27273160|a|An unresolved mystery in the field of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is why a reduction of the ubiquitously expressed Smn protein causes defects mostly in motoneurons. We addressed the possibility that this restricted vulnerability stems from elevated Smn expression in motoneurons. To explore this, we established an ex vivo zebrafish culture system of GFP - marked motoneurons to quantitatively measure Smn protein and smn mRNA levels as well as promoter activity in motoneurons versus other cell types. Importantly, we uncovered that Smn levels are elevated in motoneurons by means of transcriptional activation. In addition, we identified the ETS family transcription factor Etv5b to be responsible for increased smn transcription in motoneurons. Moreover, we established that the additional supply of Smn protein in motoneurons is necessary for proper axonogenesis in a cell-autonomous manner. These findings demonstrate the reliance of motoneurons on more Smn, thereby adding a novel piece of evidence for their increased vulnerability under SMA conditions.

27274281|t|Evaluation of response from axitinib per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors versus Choi criteria in previously treated patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma
27274281|a|Axitinib, a selective and potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, was available to patients from Canada and Australia, prior to regulatory approval of axitinib in these countries, for treatment of clear-cell metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) after failure of one prior systemic regimen. This single-arm, open-label study of axitinib evaluated the efficacy, safety, and quality of life (QoL) in patients with mRCC whose disease progressed after one prior systemic first-line regimen. Primary objective was objective response rate evaluated per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and Choi criteria. Progression-free survival, overall survival, safety, and QoL were secondary end points. Due to the small study size, analyses comprised of descriptive statistics. Fifteen patients were recruited, five from Canada and ten from Australia, over a limited recruitment period. Thirteen patients received sunitinib as prior therapy. All patients had clear-cell carcinoma, eleven had prior nephrectomy. Liver, lung, and lymph nodes were the most frequent sites of metastases; one patient had brain metastasis. Median time on axitinib was 118.0 days (range: 3.5-645.0 days); estimated survival probability at 12 months was 57.8%. Two (13.3%) patients had objective responses per RECIST versus nine (60.0%) per Choi criteria. Six patients had progressive disease based on RECIST versus three per Choi criteria. Nine (60.0%) events of progression or death occurred by the end of study, and three patients continued to receive the study drug. Fatigue (33%) and diarrhea (20%) were the most common grade ≥3 all-causality, treatment -emergent adverse events. The mean change in European Quality of Life - 5 Dimensions score from baseline to end of treatment was -0.0837. The small number of patients and lack of a comparator arm limit the ability to draw definitive conclusions; however, safety and efficacy profiles of axitinib were consistent with reports from previous studies in patients with mRCC, and patients generally maintained QoL. The sizeable difference observed in objective response rate by RECIST versus Choi criteria merits further research.

27274541|t|Biochemical characteristics of AtFAR2, a fatty acid reductase from Arabidopsis thaliana that reduces fatty acyl-CoA and - ACP substrates into fatty alcohols
27274541|a|Fatty alcohols and derivatives are important for proper deposition of a functional pollen wall. Mutations in specific genes encoding fatty acid reductases (FAR) responsible for fatty alcohol production cause abnormal development of pollen. A disrupted AtFAR2 (MS2) gene in Arabidopsis thaliana results in pollen developing an abnormal exine layer and a reduced fertility phenotype. AtFAR2 has been shown to be targeted to chloroplasts and in a purified form to be specific for acyl-ACP substrates. Here, we present data on the in vitro and in planta characterizations of AtFAR2 from A. thaliana and show that this enzyme has the ability to use both, C16:0-ACP and C16:0-CoA, as substrates to produce C16:0-alcohol. Our results further show that AtFAR2 is highly similar in properties and substrate specificity to AtFAR6 for which in vitro data has been published, and which is also a chloroplast localized enzyme. This suggests that although AtFAR2 is the major enzyme responsible for exine layer functionality, AtFAR6 might provide functional redundancy to AtFAR2.

27274791|t|Comparing Time Perception among Morphine - Derived Drugs Addicts and Controls
27274791|a|The aim of the present study is to compare time perception among drug addicts and controls. 30 drug addicts were selected, and 30 non-addict individuals were selected as the control group. The two groups performed three tests of time reproduction, time estimation, and time discrimination. There was a significant difference between the addicts group and the control group regarding the error of time reproduction and time estimation. The addict group in comparison to the control group had a lower under- reproduction and a higher over- reproduction error, and also a lower under- estimation and higher over- estimation error. However, regarding time discrimination, no significant difference was observed between the errors committed by both groups. On the other hand, when showing images of drug consumption tools and normal images with same durations, the normal group believed that the images related to drug consumption tools were shown for a shorter period of time. Time perception is different between morphine - derived drugs addicts and controls.

27277750|t|Co-delivery of pemetrexed and miR-21 antisense oligonucleotide by lipid - polymer hybrid nanoparticles and effects on glioblastoma cells
27277750|a|Combination therapy using anticancer drugs and nucleic acid is a more promising strategy to overcome multidrug resistance in cancer and to enhance apoptosis. In this study, lipid - polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPNs), which contain both pemetrexed and miR-21 antisense oligonucleotide (anti-miR-21), have been developed for treatment of glioblastoma, the most aggressive type of brain tumor. Prepared LPNs have been well characterized by particle size distribution and zeta potential measurements, determination of encapsulation efficiency, and in vitro release experiments. Morphology of LPNs was determined by transmission electron microscopy. LPNs had a hydrodynamic size below 100 nm and exhibited sustained release of pemetrexed up to 10 h. Encapsulation of pemetrexed in LPNs increased cellular uptake from 6% to 78%. Results of confocal microscopy analysis have shown that co-delivery of anti-miR-21 significantly improved accumulation of LPNs in the nucleus of U87MG cells. Nevertheless, more effective cytotoxicity results could not be obtained due to low concentration of anti-miR-21, loaded in LPNs. We expect that the effective drug delivery systems can be obtained with higher concentration of anti-miR-21 for the treatment of glioblastoma.

27279861|t|Medulloblastoma: molecular pathways and histopathological classification
27279861|a|Malignant brain tumors are the leading cause of cancer death among pediatric patients, and medulloblastoma constitutes 20% of them. Currently, the treatment is risk-adapted. Maximum surgical resection is recommended, always followed by chemotherapy and neuroaxis radiotherapy. In spite of the improving survival rate, survivors succumb to treatment - induced side effects. To reduce toxic effects, molecular-targeted treatment is proposed. Medulloblastoma research is very robust, and new articles on the subject are published daily. In the current review we have tried to bring together molecular pathophysiology of the neoplasm and current pathological classification, thus making an effort to relate tumor biology and the histological picture.

27280293|t|Spatio-Temporal History of HIV-1 CRF35_AD in Afghanistan and Iran
27280293|a|HIV-1 Circulating Recombinant Form 35_AD (CRF35_AD) has an important position in the epidemiological profile of Afghanistan and Iran. Despite the presence of this clade in Afghanistan and Iran for over a decade, our understanding of its origin and dissemination patterns is limited. In this study, we performed a Bayesian phylogeographic analysis to reconstruct the spatio-temporal dispersion pattern of this clade using eligible CRF35_AD gag and pol sequences available in the Los Alamos HIV database (432 sequences available from Iran, 16 sequences available from Afghanistan, and a single CRF35_AD -like pol sequence available from USA). Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm was implemented in BEAST v1.8.1. Between-country dispersion rates were tested with Bayesian stochastic search variable selection method and were considered significant where Bayes factor values were greater than three. The findings suggested that CRF35_AD sequences were genetically similar to parental sequences from Kenya and Uganda, and to a set of subtype A1 sequences available from Afghan refugees living in Pakistan. Our results also showed that across all phylogenies, Afghan and Iranian CRF35_AD sequences formed a monophyletic cluster (posterior clade credibility> 0.7). The divergence date of this cluster was estimated to be between 1990 and 1992. Within this cluster, a bidirectional dispersion of the virus was observed across Afghanistan and Iran. We could not clearly identify if Afghanistan or Iran first established or received this epidemic, as the root location of this cluster could not be robustly estimated. Three CRF35_AD sequences from Afghan refugees living in Pakistan nested among Afghan and Iranian CRF35_AD branches. However, the CRF35_AD -like sequence available from USA diverged independently from Kenyan subtype A1 sequences, suggesting it not to be a true CRF35_AD lineage. Potential factors contributing to viral exchange between Afghanistan and Iran could be injection drug networks and mass migration of Afghan refugees and labours to Iran, which calls for extensive preventive efforts.

27282265|t|The Benefits of Combination Therapy with Esomeprazole and Rebamipide in Symptom Improvement in Reflux Esophagitis: An International Multicenter Study
27282265|a|To investigate the effects of esomeprazole and rebamipide combination therapy on symptomatic improvement in patients with reflux esophagitis. A total of 501 patients with reflux esophagitis were randomized into one of the following two treatment regimens: 40 mg esomeprazole plus 300 mg rebamipide daily (combination therapy group) or 40 mg esomeprazole daily (monotherapy group). We used a symptom questionnaire that evaluated heartburn, acid regurgitation, and four upper gastrointestinal symptoms. The primary efficacy end point was the mean decrease in the total symptom score. The mean decreases in the total symptom score at 4 weeks were estimated to be -18.1±13.8 in the combination therapy group and -15.1±11.9 in the monotherapy group (p=0.011). Changes in reflux symptom s from baseline after 4 weeks of treatment were -8.4±6.6 in the combination therapy group and -6.8±5.9 in the monotherapy group (p=0.009). Over a 4- week treatment course, esomeprazole and rebamipide combination therapy was more effective in decreasing the symptoms of reflux esophagitis than esomeprazole monotherapy.

27283167|t|Integrating Palliative Care in Pediatric Oncology: Evidence for an Evolving Paradigm for Comprehensive Cancer Care
27283167|a|The demonstrated benefit of integrating palliative care (PC) into cancer treatment has triggered an increased need for PC services. The trajectory of integrating PC in comprehensive cancer centers, particularly pediatric centers, is unknown. We describe our 8- year experience of initiating and establishing PC with the Quality of Life Service (QoLS) at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. We retrospectively reviewed records of patients seen by the QoLS (n=615) from March 2007 to December 2014. Variables analyzed for each year, using descriptive statistics, included diagnostic groups, QoLS encounters, goals of care, duration of survival, and location of death. Total QoLS patient encounters increased from 58 (2007) to 1,297 (2014), new consults increased from 17 (2007) to 115 (2014), and mean encounters per patient increased from 5.06 (2007) to 16.11 (2014). Goal of care at initial consultation shifted from primarily comfort to an increasing goal of cure. The median number of days from initial consult to death increased from 52 days (2008) to 223 days (2014). A trend toward increased outpatient location of death was noted with 42% outpatient deaths in 2007, increasing to a majority in each subsequent year (range, 51%-74%). Hospital-wide, patients receiving PC services before death increased from approximately 50% to nearly 100%. Since its inception, the QoLS experienced a dramatic increase in referrals and encounters per patient, increased use by all clinical services, a trend toward earlier consultation and longer term follow-up, increasing outpatient location of death, and near- universal PC involvement at the end-of-life. The successful integration of PC in a comprehensive cancer center, and the resulting potential for improved care provision over time, can serve as a model for other programs on a broad scale.

27285457|t|PROTECTIVE EFFECTS OF DIPEPTIDYL PEPTIDASE-4 INHIBITORS ON PROGRESSION OF DIABETIC RETINOPATHY IN PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES
27285457|a|To investigate the effects of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4) on the progression of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in patients with Type 2 diabetes based on the DR severity scale. The medical records of 82 patients with Type 2 diabetes enrolled from 2005 to 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Fundus photographs were graded using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study methods. The associations between baseline risk factors and progression of DR were investigated. Seven of 28 patients treated with DPP4 inhibitors and 26 of 54 treated with other hypoglycemic agents showed progression of retinopathy, defined as one or more steps on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study scale (P = 0.043). Only treatment with DPP4 inhibitors significantly reduced the progression of DR in patients after propensity score matching (P = 0.009). Treatment with DPP4 inhibitors was associated with a lower risk of DR progression (P = 0.011). Treatment with DPP4 inhibitors was the independent protective factor against the progression of DR, aside from improving glycemic control. This is the first study to show the benefits of DPP4 inhibitors in reducing DR progression, and provides encouraging preliminary data for further evaluation of DPP4 inhibitors in the progression of DR in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

27293894|t|Production of Laccase by Cochliobolus sp. Isolated from Plastic Dumped Soils and Their Ability to Degrade Low Molecular Weight PVC
27293894|a|One of the utmost man-made problems faced today has been the ever - increasing plastic waste filling the world. It accounts for an estimated 20-30% (by volume) of municipal solid waste in landfill sites worldwide. Research on plastic biodegradation has been steadily growing over the past four decades. Several fungi have been identified that produce enzymes capable of plastic degradation in various laboratory conditions. This paper presents a study that determined the ability of fungi to degrade low molecular weight polyvinyl chloride (PVC) by the enzyme laccase. We have isolated a fungal species, Cochliobolus sp., from plastic dumped soils and they were cultured on Czapek Dox Agar slants at 30°C. The effectiveness of this fungal species on the degradation of commercial low molecular weight polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was studied under laboratory conditions. Significant differences were observed from the FTIR, GC-MS, and SEM results in between control and Cochliobolus sp. treated PVC.

27294945|t|Effects of Cerium and Titanium Oxide Nanoparticles in Soil on the Nutrient Composition of Barley (Hordeum vulgare L .) Kernels
27294945|a|The implications of metal nanoparticles (MeNPs) are still unknown for many food crops. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of cerium oxide (nCeO₂) and titanium oxide (nTiO₂) nanoparticles in soil at 0, 500 and 1000 mg·kg(-1) on the nutritional parameters of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) kernels. Mineral nutrients, amylose, β-glucans, amino acid and crude protein (CP) concentrations were measured in kernels. Whole flour samples were analyzed by ICP-AES/MS, HPLC and Elemental CHNS Analyzer. Results showed that Ce and Ti accumulation under MeNPs treatments did not differ from the control treatment. However, nCeO₂ and nTiO₂ had an impact on composition and nutritional quality of barley kernels in contrasting ways. Both MeNPs left β-glucans unaffected but reduced amylose content by approximately 21%. Most amino acids and CP increased. Among amino acids, lysine followed by proline saw the largest increase (51% and 37%, respectively). Potassium and S were both negatively impacted by MeNPs, while B was only affected by 500 mg nCeO₂ ·kg(-1). On the contrary Zn and Mn concentrations were improved by 500 mg nTiO₂ ·kg(-1), and Ca by both nTiO₂ treatments. Generally, our findings demonstrated that kernels are negatively affected by nCeO₂ while nTiO₂ can potentially have beneficial effects. However, both MeNPs have the potential to negatively impact malt and feed production.

27305683|t|Quantifying Nonlinear Contributions to Cortical Responses Evoked by Continuous Wrist Manipulation
27305683|a|Cortical responses to continuous stimuli as recorded using either magneto- or electroencephalography (EEG) have shown power at harmonics of the stimulated frequency, indicating nonlinear behavior. Even though the selection of analysis techniques depends on the linearity of the system under study, the importance of nonlinear contributions to cortical responses has not been formally addressed. The goal of this paper is to quantify the nonlinear contributions to the cortical response obtained from continuous sensory stimulation. EEG was used to record the cortical response evoked by continuous movement of the wrist joint of healthy subjects applied with a robotic manipulator. Multisine stimulus signals (i.e., the sum of several sinusoids) elicit a periodic cortical response and allow to assess the nonlinear contributions to the response. Wrist dynamics (relation between joint angle and torque) were successfully linearized, explaining 99% of the response. In contrast, the cortical response revealed a highly nonlinear relation; where most power (∼ 80 %) occurred at non-stimulated frequencies. Moreover, only 10% of the response could be explained using a nonparametric linear model. These results indicate that the recorded evoked cortical responses are governed by nonlinearities and that linear methods do not suffice when describing the relation between mechanical stimulus and cortical response.

27306679|t|Using melanopsin to study G protein signaling in cortical neurons
27306679|a|Our understanding of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in the central nervous system (CNS) has been hampered by the limited availability of tools allowing for the study of their signaling with precise temporal control. To overcome this, we tested the utility of the bistable mammalian opsin melanopsin to examine G protein signaling in CNS neurons. Specifically, we used biolistic (gene gun) approaches to transfect melanopsin into cortical pyramidal cells maintained in organotypic slice culture. Whole cell recordings from transfected neurons indicated that application of blue light effectively activated the transfected melanopsin to elicit the canonical biphasic modulation of membrane excitability previously associated with the activation of GPCRs coupling to Gαq-11 Remarkably, full mimicry of exogenous agonist concentration could be obtained with pulses as short as a few milliseconds, suggesting that their triggering required a single melanopsin activation-deactivation cycle. The resulting temporal control over melanopsin activation allowed us to compare the activation kinetics of different components of the electrophysiological response. We also replaced the intracellular loops of melanopsin with those of the 5-HT2A receptor to create a light-activated GPCR capable of interacting with the 5-HT2A receptor interacting proteins. The resulting chimera expressed weak activity but validated the potential usefulness of melanopsin as a tool for the study of G protein signaling in CNS neurons.

27308854|t|Maternal vitamin D levels and the risk of perinatal death
27308854|a|To determine the association between maternal vitamin D levels and perinatal death. A retrospective cross-sectional study of all non-anomalous, singleton births (≥24 weeks) with perinatal death compared to a matched control group. Only pregnancies with a recorded vitamin D level at booking (8-19 weeks gestation) were included for analysis. Maternal vitamin D levels were categorized into normal, deficient and insufficient cohorts and variables compared between the three groups. There were 31 perinatal deaths which were compared to 111 controls. Median vitamin D levels were lower in the perinatal death cohort compared to the control group (55 nmol/L versus 64 nmol/L, p = 0.43). There was no significant increase in deaths between the normal and deficient (p = 0.33) or insufficient (p = 0.09) groups. Low maternal vitamin D levels at booking were not associated with an increased risk of perinatal demise.

27312354|t|Effect of constitutive inactivation of the myostatin gene on the gain in muscle strength during postnatal growth in two murine models
27312354|a|The effect of constitutive inactivation of the gene encoding myostatin on the gain in muscle performance during postnatal growth has not been well characterized. We analyzed 2 murine myostatin knockout (KO) models, (i) the Lee model (KO(Lee)) and (ii) the Grobet model (KO(Grobet)), and measured the contraction of tibialis anterior muscle in situ. Absolute maximal isometric force was increased in 6-month-old KO(Lee) and KO(Grobet) mice, as compared to wild-type mice. Similarly, absolute maximal power was increased in 6-month-old KO(Lee) mice. In contrast, specific maximal force (relative maximal force per unit of muscle mass was decreased in all 6-month-old male and female KO mice, except in 6-month -old female KO(Grobet) mice, whereas specific maximal power was reduced only in male KO(Lee) mice. Genetic inactivation of myostatin increases maximal force and power, but in return it reduces muscle quality, particularly in male mice. Muscle Nerve 55: 254-261, 2017.

27314612|t|Methylation status of the promoter region of the human frizzled 9 gene in acute myeloid leukemia
27314612|a|The FZD9 gene is located at chromosome 7q11.23, and has been indicated to be a tumor suppressor gene. The present study examined the involvement of FZD9 promoter methylation in the downregulation of FZD9 expression in leukemia cells. The expression of the FZD9 gene was absent in various leukemic cell lines, while it was restored following treatment with DNA demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Bisulfite sequencing analysis of the FZD9 promoter region showed that it was partially methylated in cell lines in which FZD9 gene was not expressed. Thus, DNA methylation in the promoter region may lead to inactivation of the FZD9 gene, which may represent and aberration associated with leukemia, since DNA was not methylated in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Methylation -specific polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the promoter region of the FZD9 gene was frequently methylated in primary or relapse acute myeloid leukemia (52.9%; excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia); however, methylation was infrequent in B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (5.6%). In conclusion, the present study indicated that the methylation profile of the FZD9 gene corresponded to that of a candidate tumor-suppressor gene in acute myeloid leukemia.

27318197|t|Identification of a group of XTHs genes responding to heavy metal mercury, salinity and drought stresses in Medicago truncatula
27318197|a|Xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolases (XTH) are one of the key enzymes regulating cell wall construction, extension and metabolism. In the study, 44 XTH protein genes from Medicago truncatula genome were identified using bioinformatics, microarray and RT-PCR. Each XTH was showed to possess a highly conserved domain ((D/N)-E-(I/L/F/V)-D-(F/I/L)-E-(F/L)-L-G), and most of XTHs possess four Cys in the C terminal region, which suggests the potential for generating disulfide bonds. Based on the XTH protein sequences, these XTHs can be classified into three major families and each family can be subdivided into more groups. Examination of the genomic location of XTH genes on M. truncatula chromosomes showed that the evolutional expansion of the genes was possibly attributed to localized gene duplications. To investigate the possible involvement of the XTHs responding to heavy metals and other abiotic stresses, the XTH genes were exposed to heavy metal (Hg or Cu), salt and drought stresses. There were 28, 21 and 21 MtXTH genes found to respond to HgCl2, salt and drought stresses, respectively, but their expression were different under the stresses. Some of the XTH genes were well confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). We further specified expression of a XTH gene Medtr4g128580 (MtXTH3) under different environmental stresses, and showed that MtXTH3 was induced by Hg exposure. These results indicated that a group of MtXTHs could be differentially expressed under the environmental stresses.

27318553|t|Vestibular disorders and nausea during head and neck intensity-modulated radiation therapy
27318553|a|We studied whether there is a relationship between nausea and vestibular disorders in patients treated with intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for head and neck cancer. We performed a prospective single-centre study that enrolled 31 patients. A videonystagmography was carried out before and within 15 days after radiation therapy for each patient. Nausea was assessed at baseline, every week, and at the post-radiotherapy videonystagmography visit. Twenty-six patients had benefited from a complete interpretable videonystagmography. For 14 of these patients vestibular damage was diagnosed post-radiotherapy. During irradiation, six patients felt nauseous, but without dizziness. In univariate analysis, we found a relationship statistically significant between the average dose received by the vestibules and vestibular disorder videonystagmography (P=0.001, odds ratio [OR]: 1.08 [1.025-.138]), but there was no relationship between vestibular disorder videonystagmography and nausea (P=0.701). Irradiation of the vestibular system during IMRT does not seem to explain the nausea.

27318951|t|Preventing Youth Internalizing Symptoms Through the Familias Unidas Intervention: Examining Variation in Response
27318951|a|Prevention programs that strengthen parenting and family functioning have been found to reduce poor behavioral outcomes in adolescents, including substance use, HIV risk, externalizing and internalizing problems. However, there is evidence that not all youth benefit similarly from these programs. Familias Unidas is a family-focused intervention designed to prevent substance use and sexual risk among Hispanic youth and has recently demonstrated unanticipated reductions in internalizing symptoms for some youth. This paper examines variation in intervention response for internalizing symptoms using individual-level data pooled across four distinct Familias Unidas trials: (1) 266 eighth grade students recruited from the general school population; (2) 160 ninth grade students from the general school population; (3) 213 adolescents with conduct, aggression, and/or attention problems; and (4) 242 adolescents with a delinquency history. Causal inference growth mixture modeling suggests a three- class model. The two largest classes represent youth with low (60 %) and medium (27 %) internalizing symptoms at baseline, and both intervention and control participants show reductions in internalizing symptoms. The third class (13 %) represents youth with high levels of baseline internalizing symptoms who remain at steady levels of internalizing symptoms when exposed to the intervention, but who experience an increase in symptoms under the control condition. Female gender, low baseline levels of parent - adolescent communication, and older age were associated with membership in the high-risk class. These synthesis analyses involving a large sample of youth with varying initial risk levels represent a further step toward strengthening our knowledge of preventive intervention response and improving preventive interventions.

27319985|t|Acute Kidney Injury Severity and Long-Term Readmission and Mortality After Cardiac Surgery
27319985|a|Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication after cardiac surgery. While AKI severity is known to be associated with increased risk of short-term outcomes, its long-term impact is less well understood. Adult patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass graft surgery at eight centers were enrolled into the Northern New England biomarker registry (n = 1,610). Patients were excluded if they had renal failure (n = 15) or died during index admission (n = 38). Severity of AKI was defined using the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN). We linked our cohort to national Medicare and state all-payer claims to ascertain readmissions and to the National Death Index to ascertain survival. Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox proportional hazards modeling was conducted for time to readmission and death over 5 years. Within 5 years, 513 patients (33.8%) had AKI with AKIN stage 1 (29.9%) and stage 2 to 3 (3.9%). There were 620 readmissions (39.9%) and 370 deaths (23.8%). After adjustment, stage 1 AKI patients had a 31% increased risk of readmission (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.10 to 1.57), whereas stage 2 or 3 patients had a 98% increased risk (95% CI: 1.41 to 2.78) compared with patients having no AKI. Relative to patients without AKI, stage 1 patients had a 56% increased risk of mortality (95% CI: 1.14 to 2.13), whereas stage 2 or 3 patients had a 3.5 times higher risk (95% CI: 2.16 to 5.60). Severity of AKI using the AKIN stage criteria is associated with a significantly increased risk of 5-year readmission and mortality. Our findings suggest that efforts to reduce AKI in the perioperative period may have a significant long-term impact on patients and payers in reducing mortality and health care utilization.

27321338|t|Association of abdominal fat with serum amylase in an older cohort: The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging
27321338|a|Abdominal fat is a major determinant of metabolic diseases in older individuals. Obesity and diabetes are associated with low serum amylase (SA) levels, but the association between SA and metabolic disease is poorly understood. We investigated the association of low SA with diabetes and sex - specific associations of serum amylase with abdominal fat in older adults. In community-dwelling volunteers from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (778 participants, age 66.8±13.6 years), we assessed abdominal fat by computed tomography and diabetes status using the American Diabetes Association criteria. Linear regression analyses assessed the cross-sectional associations between abdominal fat and SA, and logistic regression assessed the odds of diabetes, given low SA. In unadjusted analyses, individuals in the lowest SA quartile (<48μ/L) had 1.97 greater odds of diabetes, (95% CI, 1.01-3.83) than those in the highest quartile (⩾80μ/L). This association was no longer significant after adjusting for visceral adipose tissue area (VAT, dm(2)), abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT, dm(2)) or BMI. In adjusted analyses, VAT and SAT were significantly associated with SA in both sexes. Among women, SA was more strongly associated with VAT than with SAT or BMI; VAT (β=-0.117±0.048, P<0.001), SAT (β=-0.023±0.025, P=0.346) and BMI (β=-0.0052±0.075, P=0.49). The association between SA and diabetes was explained mainly by abdominal visceral fat. In women, SA was more strongly associated with VAT than with BMI or SAT. These findings provide motivation for future mechanistic studies on SA's role in metabolic diseases.

27321568|t|Efficacy of Intravenous Chlorothiazide for Refractory Acute Decompensated Heart Failure Unresponsive to Adjunct Metolazone
27321568|a|To assess the efficacy of intravenous chlorothiazide in patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) who were determined to be loop diuretic resistant and refractory to metolazone. Retrospective cohort study with patients serving as their own controls. Large, academic, tertiary care hospital. Forty-five patients with ADHF who had an inadequate response to high-dose loop diuretics and then received at least one dose of oral metolazone 5 mg or greater (metolazone index dose) followed by at least one dose of intravenous chlorothiazide 500 mg (chlorothiazide index dose) if the response to metolazone was considered inadequate, according to the institutional protocol, between February 4, 2013, and February 28, 2015, were included. If multiple doses of metolazone were administered, the last dose given before the chlorothiazide index dose was considered the index dose; the metolazone index dose had to have been administered more than 2 hours before the chlorothiazide index dose. Data for a total of 90 diuretic doses (45 metolazone, 45 chlorothiazide) were included in the analysis. The median dose of loop diuretic in intravenous furosemide equivalents given over the 24- hour period before the metolazone index dose was 400 mg. The average length of stay was 34.7 days, and in-hospital mortality was 35.6% (16/45 patients). The primary end point of a net-negative urine output of 500 ml or greater during the 12 hours after the index dose occurred in 42.2% (19/45 patients) and 35.5% (16/45 patients) for the chlorothiazide and metolazone doses, respectively (p=0.581). The median 12- hour urine output following administration of metolazone was 810 ml (interquartile range [IQR] 866 ml) versus 1075 ml (IQR 940 ml) following administration of chlorothiazide (p=0.363). Compared with metolazone, the chlorothiazide doses did not result in an increase in urine output of at least 500 ml during the 12 hours following the dose relative to the 12 hours before the dose (31.1% vs 22.2%, p=0.754). No significant difference in achievement of net-negative urine output of 500 ml or greater during the 12 hours following the chlorothiazide or metolazone dose was noted (42.2% for chlorothiazide vs 35.5% for metolazone, p=0.581). The addition of intravenous chlorothiazide did not result in improved diuresis in patients with ADHF determined to be refractory to loop diuretic s and adjunctive oral metolazone.

27322653|t|Comparisons of Safety and Clinical Outcomes Between Multiple-level and Single-level Cervical Disk Replacement for Cervical Spondylosis: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
27322653|a|This is a systematic review and meta-analysis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of multiple-level cervical disk replacement (CDR) over single-level CDR for the treatment of cervical spondylosis. Some authors advocate for the multiple-level CDR instead of anterior decompression and fusion in cervical multiple-level spondylosis. However, whether the efficacy and safety of multi-level CDR are as favorable as that of single-level CDR remains controversial. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane library databases were searched up to November 2015 for controlled studies that compared the clinical outcomes of single-level and multiple-level CDR for the treatment of cervical spondylosis. The following outcomes were extracted and analyzed: prevalence of heterotopic ossification and reoperation, preoperative and postoperative Neck Disability Index scores, preoperative and postoperative Visual Analog Scale scores, and success rate using the Odom grading system. Ten studies involving 1402 patients were included: including 3 randomized controlled trials, 5 prospective studies, and 3 retrospective studies. No significant differences between single-level and multiple-level groups were found in terms of the prevalence of heterotopic ossification and reoperation rate, Neck Disability Index score, Visual Analog Scale score, and success rate using the Odom grading system. On the basis of this meta-analysis, clinical outcomes of multiple-level CDR are similar to those of single-level CDR for cervical spondylosis, which suggests the multiple-level CDR is as effective and safe as the single-level CDR. Nonetheless, more well-designed studies are needed for further evaluation.

27330692|t|Evaluation of the Effects of Intravenous and Percutaneous Low Level Laser Therapy in the Management of Shoulder Myofascial Pain Syndrome
27330692|a|Myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) treatment is challenging with a high recurrence rate and still lacks a clear treatment frame. Therefore research on new, more efficient and long lasting effect treatment modalities is necessary. This study looked at the effects of intravenous laser therapy (IVL) and percutaneous low level laser (PLLL) in the management of shoulder MPS. In this randomized controlled trial, 30 patients fulfilling inclusion criteria were randomly equally allocated to 3 groups, control, IVL and PLLL. Control group received 12 sessions of placebo low level laser, IVL group received 12 sessions of IVL therapy, and PLLL group received 12 sessions of PLLL therapy. All patients were trained for better body posture, body mechanics, gentle massage of trigger points, stretching exercises of affected muscle (trapezius), and received 10 mg of oral nortriptyline regimen every night for 3 months. Outcomes included pain severity, functional disability, and quality of life. Patients were assessed using Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), Pain Disability Index (PDI), and Short Form Health Survey (SF-12). Data collected were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA), Mann-Whitney and t tests. The mean of PDI and maximum pain intensity during day and night significantly reduced in both PLLL and IVL groups compared to control group. Although pain severity and PDI reduction was more pronounced in IVL group compared to PLLL group, the differences were not statistically significant. Also, quality of life statistically significantly improved in both IVL and PLLL groups compared to control group was more, and although higher in IVL group, the difference was not statistically significant when compared to PLLL group. No side effects were observed in the intervention groups. Intravenous laser and PLLL therapy had a positive effect on pain severity and PDI reduction, and quality of life in this study. Also no adverse event was recorded. Thus, intravenous lasers and PLLL therapy seem to be effective complementary modalities in managing patients with shoulder MPS.

27331407|t|Structural Insights into 5-HT1A / D4 Selectivity of WAY-100635 Analogues: Molecular Modeling, Synthesis, and in Vitro Binding
27331407|a|The resurgence of interest in 5-HT1A receptors as a therapeutic target requires the existence of highly selective 5-HT1A ligands. To date, WAY-100635 has been the prototypical antagonist of these receptors. However, this compound also has significant affinity for and activity at D4 dopamine receptors. In this context, this work was aimed at better understanding the 5-HT1A / D4 selectivity of WAY-100635 and analogues from a structural point of view. In silico investigations revealed two key interactions for the 5-HT1A / D4 selectivity of WAY-100635 and analogues. First, a hydrogen bond only found with the Ser 7.36 of D4 receptor appeared to be the key for a higher D4 affinity for newly synthesized aza analogues. The role of Ser 7.36 was confirmed as the affinity of aza analogues for the mutant D4 receptor S7.36A was reduced. Then, the formation of another hydrogen bond with the conserved Ser 5.42 residue appeared to be also critical for D4 binding.

27334470|t|Genomic analysis of nontypeable pneumococci causing invasive pneumococcal disease in South Africa, 2003-2013
27334470|a|The capsular polysaccharide is the principal virulence factor of Streptococcus pneumoniae and a target for current pneumococcal vaccines. However, some pathogenic pneumococci are serologically nontypeable [nontypeable pneumococci (NTPn)]. Due to their relative rarity, NTPn are poorly characterized, and, as such, limited data exist which describe these organisms. We aimed to describe disease and genotypically characterize NTPn causing invasive pneumococcal disease in South Africa. Isolates were detected through national, laboratory - based surveillance for invasive pneumococcal disease in South Africa and characterized by whole genome analysis. We predicted ancestral serotypes (serotypes from which NTPn may have originated) for Group I NTPn using multilocus sequence typing and capsular region sequence analyses. Antimicrobial resistance patterns and mutations potentially causing nontypeability were identified. From 2003-2013, 39 (0.1 %, 39/32,824) NTPn were reported. Twenty-two (56 %) had partial capsular genes (Group I) and 17 (44 %) had complete capsular deletion of which 15 had replacement by other genes (Group II). Seventy-nine percent (31/39) of our NTPn isolates were derived from encapsulated S. pneumoniae. Ancestral serotypes 1 (27 %, 6/22) and 8 (14 %, 3/22) were most prevalent, and 59 % (13/22) of ancestral serotypes were serotypes included in the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. We identified a variety of mutations within the capsular region of Group I NTPn, some of which may be responsible for the nontypeable phenotype. Nonsusceptibility to tetracycline and erythromycin was higher in NTPn than encapsulated S. pneumoniae. NTPn are currently a rare cause of invasive pneumococcal disease in South Africa and represent a genetically diverse collection of isolates.

27334522|t|Pre-hypertension, pre-diabetes or both: which is best at predicting cardiovascular events in the long term?
27334522|a|The present study aimed to assess the value of pre-diabetes and pre-hypertension in predicting cardiovascular events. A population -based, cross-sectional survey was conducted, representing a large sample of the general Iranian population aged 35 years and older from the Isfahan Province and determined using a random, multistage cluster-sampling 10-year cohort. The five end points considered as study outcome were unstable angina (UA), acute occurrence of myocardial infarction (MI), sudden cardiac death (SCD), brain stroke and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Of the 6323 subjects scheduled for assessment of diabetes state 617 were diabetics and 712 were pre-diabetic. In addition, of these subjects, 1754 had hypertension and 2500 had pre-hypertension. Analysing only pre-hypertension, pre-diabetes and its combination and adjusted for gender and age variables, pre-hypertension and pre-diabetes status together, could only effectively predict occurrence of MI (hazard ratio (HR)=3.21, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06-9.76, P=0.04). In the same COX regression models, pre-hypertension status could predict UA and CVD occurrence (HR =2.94, 95% CI: 1.68-5.14, P<0.001 and HR =1.74, 95% CI: 1.23-2.47, P=0.002, respectively). However, pre-diabetes status could not predict any of these events after adjustment for gender and age. Our data provide valuable evidence of the triggering role of pre-hypertension and pre-diabetes together, on appearance and progression of MI even in healthy individuals and the significant predicting value of pre-hypertension on the occurrence of UA and CVD. In this regard, the value of pre-hypertension and pre-diabetes together, and the pre-hypertension state alone, are clearly superior to pre-diabetes state alone in predicting cardiovascular events.

27337390|t|Learned helplessness at fifty: Insights from neuroscience
27337390|a|Learned helplessness, the failure to escape shock induced by uncontrollable aversive events, was discovered half a century ago. Seligman and Maier (1967) theorized that animals learned that outcomes were independent of their responses -that nothing they did mattered-and that this learning undermined trying to escape. The mechanism of learned helplessness is now very well-charted biologically, and the original theory got it backward. Passivity in response to shock is not learned. It is the default, unlearned response to prolonged aversive events and it is mediated by the serotonergic activity of the dorsal raphe nucleus, which in turn inhibits escape. This passivity can be overcome by learning control, with the activity of the medial prefrontal cortex, which subserves the detection of control leading to the automatic inhibition of the dorsal raphe nucleus. So animals learn that they can control aversive events, but the passive failure to learn to escape is an unlearned reaction to prolonged aversive stimulation. In addition, alterations of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex - dorsal raphe pathway can come to subserve the expectation of control. We speculate that default passivity and the compensating detection and expectation of control may have substantial implications for how to treat depression. (PsycINFO Database Record

27339305|t|A peptide from human β thymosin as a platform for the development of new anti-biofilm agents for Staphylococcus spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa
27339305|a|Conventional antibiotics might fail in the treatment of biofilm -associated infections causing infection recurrence and chronicity. The search for antimicrobial peptides has been performed with the aim to discover novel anti-infective agents active on pathogens in both planktonic and biofilm associated forms. The fragment 9-19 of human thymosin β4 was studied through 1 μs MD simulation. Two main conformations of the peptide were detected, both constituted by a central hydrophobic core and by the presence of peripheral charged residues suggesting a possible mechanism of interaction with two models of biological membranes, related to eukaryotic or bacterial membrane respectively. In addition, the peptide was chemically synthesized and its antimicrobial activity was tested in vitro against planktonic and biofilm form of a group of reference strains of Staphylococcus spp. and one P. aeruginosa strain. The human thymosin β4 fragment EIEKFDKSKLK showed antibacterial activity against staphylococcal strains and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 15442 at concentrations from 12.5 to 6.2 mg/ml and inhibited biofilm formation at sub-inhibitory concentrations (3.1-0.75 mg/ml). The activity of the fragment in inhibiting biofilm formation, could be due to the conformations highlighted by the MD simulations, suggesting its interaction with the bacterial membrane. Human thymosin β4 fragment can be considered a promising lead compound to develop novel synthetic or recombinant derivatives with improved pharmaceutical potential.

27339893|t|Structural Basis for Simvastatin Competitive Antagonism of Complement Receptor 3
27339893|a|The complement system is an important part of the innate immune response to infection but may also cause severe complications during inflammation. Small molecule antagonists to complement receptor 3 (CR3) have been widely sought, but a structural basis for their mode of action is not available. We report here on the structure of the human CR3 ligand-binding I domain in complex with simvastatin. Simvastatin targets the metal ion-dependent adhesion site of the open, ligand-binding conformation of the CR3 I domain by direct contact with the chelated Mg(2+) ion. Simvastatin antagonizes I domain binding to the complement fragments iC3b and C3d but not to intercellular adhesion molecule-1. By virtue of the I domain's wide distribution in binding kinetics to ligands, it was possible to identify ligand binding kinetics as discriminator for simvastatin antagonism. In static cellular experiments, 15-25 μm simvastatin reduced adhesion by K562 cells expressing recombinant CR3 and by primary human monocytes, with an endogenous expression of this receptor. Application of force to adhering monocytes potentiated the effects of simvastatin where only a 50-100 nm concentration of the drug reduced the adhesion by 20-40% compared with untreated cells. The ability of simvastatin to target CR3 in its ligand binding - activated conformation is a novel mechanism to explain the known anti-inflammatory effects of this compound, in particular because this CR3 conformation is found in pro-inflammatory environments. Our report points to new designs of CR3 antagonists and opens new perspectives and identifies druggable receptors from characterization of the ligand binding kinetics in the presence of antagonists.

27346336|t|Common Laboratory Parameters for Differentiating Between Community-Acquired and Healthcare-Associated Pneumonia
27346336|a|The correct diagnosis of healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) as opposed to community-acquired pneumonia is essential for the selection of a correct empirical antimicrobial approach, reserving the broad-spectrum or highly potent antimicrobial therapies for resistant strains most commonly present in HCAP, whereas treating the less resistant strains, most commonly associated with community and long-term care facility - acquired infections, with a more targeted empirical approach. The standard approach today is to differentiate between the two based on the medical history of the past 90 days prior to admission. Measurable, quantitative assessment may be able to assist in this decision. The objective of this study is to find a measurable method of differentiating between community-acquired and healthcare-associated pneumonias. The records of 126 patients admitted with a diagnosis of pneumonia were divided into two groups based on the probable cause of their disease, in accordance with common practice. The routine laboratory work taken upon admittance was analyzed using logistical regression and Student's t-test. We have found that the red blood cell distribution width and the neutrophil -to- lymphocyte ratio, both routine parameters obtained in a simple blood count, can each assist in differentiating between community-acquired and healthcare-associated pneumonias. We have found two statistically significant parameters that may be used as adjuncts to the medical history, chest radiography and other parameters in forming an immediate clinical impression of a patient presenting with pneumonia.

This study aims to analyze the impact of an individual reminiscence program in a group of older persons with cognitive decline living in nursing homes on the dimensions of cognition, autobiographical memory, mood, behavior and anxiety. A two-group pre-test and post-test design with single blinded assessment was conducted. Forty-one participants were randomized to an experimental group (n=20) and a control group (n=21). The first group attended five weekly individual reminiscence sessions. Changes in the outcome measures were examined for cognition (Montreal Cognitive Assessment; Autobiographical Memory Test), behavior (Alzheimer Disease Assessment Subscale Non-Cog) and emotional status (Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia; Geriatric Depression Scale, and Geriatric Anxiety Inventory). Participants attending reminiscence sessions exhibited better outcomes compared to the control group in cognition, anxiety and depression (p<0.001), and presented a higher number of retrieved autobiographical events, specificity of evoked memories and positive valence of events (p<0.001), and also presented lower latency time for recalling events, and lower negative recalled events (p<0.01). This study supports the potential value of reminiscence therapy in improving the recall of autobiographical memory. Reminiscence therapy can be helpful to maintain or improve cognitive function, decrease anxiety and manage depressive symptoms and altered behavior, but further investigation is needed to clarify long-term effects.

27348285|t|Economic Burden of Illness Among Patients with Severe Asthma in a Managed Care Setting
27348285|a|Despite intensive pharmacotherapy, a considerable number of patients with severe asthma have inadequate disease control. Patients with severe asthma who experience exacerbations consume significant health care resources. To assess health care resource utilization and associated costs among patients with persistent severe asthma who experienced exacerbations compared with patients with persistent but nonsevere asthma. This retrospective analysis of a national administrative claims database identified patients aged ≥ 12 years who had at least 1 medical claim with an asthma diagnosis in 2012 and had continuous medical and pharmacy coverage under a commercial or Medicare Advantage plan from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2013. Patients were assigned to 1 of 2 mutually exclusive cohorts - persistent asthma (PA) or severe asthma (SA)-according to an established algorithm based on asthma -related health care resource use and pharmacy claims for controller medication. SA patients were required to meet PA criteria and also have evidence of ≥2 asthma exacerbations in 2012. Asthma -related health care resource utilization and costs were computed from asthma medication use (rescue and controller therapy) and medical claims with an asthma diagnosis in the primary position in 2012 and 2013. Adherence to controller therapy was assessed over 365 days by using the proportion of days covered (PDC), starting with the first claim for controller therapy in 2012. Differences between the PA and SA cohorts were analyzed by t-test for continuous variables and chi-square test for categorical variables. Asthma -related costs in 2013 were also analyzed using a generalized linear model with a gamma distribution and log link, adjusted for patient demographics (age, gender, region, and insurance type) and Quan-Charlson comorbidity score. A total of 65,359 patients were included: 63,597 (97.3%) PA patients and 1,762 SA patients (2.7%). Compared with the PA cohort, the SA cohort was older (mean age = 50.8 years vs. 46.5 years, P < 0.001) and had higher mean comorbidity score (1.47 vs. 1.31, P< 0.001). The mean count of all asthma medications fills was 2.2-fold (2012) and 2.1-fold (2013) higher in the SA cohort, compared with the PA cohort (P< 0.001). Mean PDC for all oral and inhaled controller therapy was also higher in the SA cohort compared with the PA cohort (0.80 vs. 0.65, P< 0.001). SA patients had a significantly greater mean count of asthma -related hospitalizations, emergency room visits, and ambulatory visits in 2012 and 2013 (P< 0.001). Unadjusted mean annual asthma -related costs in the SA versus PA cohorts were $6,496 versus $2,739 (P < 0.001) in 2012 and $5,174 versus $1,775 (P< 0.001) in 2013. Higher asthma -related costs were driven by greater mean annual asthma medication costs in 2012 ($4,545 vs. $1,738, P< 0.001) and 2013 ($4,068 vs. $1,348, P< 0.001). Adjusted mean annual asthma -related costs in 2013 were $3,336 greater (cost ratio =2.878, P< 0.001) in the SA cohort, and adjusted mean annual asthma medication costs were $2,672 higher (cost ratio=2.982, P< 0.001) in the SA cohort. Patients with SA who experienced 2 or more exacerbations had 2.1-fold greater use of controller medications across both study years and were more adherent to controller therapy than patients with PA. Despite more intensive pharmacotherapy, SA patients incurred 2.9-fold higher adjusted asthma -related costs and 3-fold higher adjusted asthma medication costs than PA patients. Patients with SA consistently demonstrated a higher rate of health care utilization. Funding for this study (HO-14-14443) was provided by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).

27348405|t|Differential regulation of spontaneous and evoked inhibitory synaptic transmission in somatosensory cortex by retinoic acid
27348405|a|Retinoic acid (RA), a developmental morphogen, has emerged in recent studies as a novel synaptic signaling molecule that acts in mature hippocampal neurons to modulate excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in the context of homeostatic synaptic plasticity. However, it is unclear whether RA is capable of modulating neural circuits outside of the hippocampus, and if so, whether the mode of RA's action at synapses is similar to that within the hippocampal network. Here we explore for the first time RA 's synaptic function outside the hippocampus and uncover a novel function of all-trans retinoic acid at inhibitory synapses. Acute RA treatment increases spontaneous inhibitory synaptic transmission in L2/3 pyramidal neurons of the somatosensory cortex, and this effect requires expression of RA's receptor RARα both pre- and post-synaptically. Intriguingly, RA does not seem to affect evoked inhibitory transmission assayed with either extracellular stimulation or direct activation of action potentials in presynaptic interneurons at connected pairs of interneurons and pyramidal neurons. Taken together, these results suggest that RA's action at synapses is not monotonous, but is diverse depending on the type of synaptic connection (excitatory versus inhibitory) and circuit (hippocampal versus cortical). Thus, synaptic signaling of RA may mediate multi-faceted regulation of synaptic plasticity. In addition to its classic roles in brain development, retinoic acid (RA) has recently been shown to regulate excitatory and inhibitory transmission in the adult brain. Here, the authors show that in layer 2/3 (L2/3) of the somatosensory cortex (S1), acute RA induces increases in spontaneous but not action-potential evoked transmission, and that this requires retinoic acid receptor (RARα) both in presynaptic PV -positive interneurons and postsynaptic pyramidal (PN) neurons.

27348711|t|Utilization Pattern and Drug Use of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Western Medicine, and Integrated Chinese-Western Medicine Treatments for Allergic Rhinitis Under the National Health Insurance Program in Taiwan
27348711|a|Patients in Taiwan with allergic rhinitis seek not only Western medicine treatment but also Traditional Chinese Medicine treatment or integrated Chinese-Western medicine treatment. Various studies have conducted pairwise comparison on Traditional Chinese Medicine, Western medicine, and integrated Chinese-Western medicine treatments. However, none conducted simultaneous analysis of the three treatments. This study analyzed patients with allergic rhinitis receiving the three treatments to identify differences in demographic characteristic and medical use and thereby to determine drug use patterns of different treatments. The National Health Insurance Research Database was the data source, and included patients were those diagnosed with allergic rhinitis (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes 470-478). Chi-square test and Tukey studentized range (honest significant difference) test were conducted to investigate the differences among the three treatments. Visit frequency for allergic rhinitis treatment was higher in female than male patients, regardless of treatment with Traditional Chinese Medicine, Western medicine, or integrated Chinese-Western medicine. Persons aged 0-19 years ranked the highest in proportion of visits for allergic rhinitis. Traditional Chinese Medicine treatment had more medical items per person-time and daily drug cost per person-time and had the lowest total expenditure per person-time. In contrast, Western medicine had the lowest daily drug cost per person-time and the highest total expenditure per person-time. The total expenditure per person-time, daily drug cost per person-time, and medical items per person-time of integrated Chinese-Western medicine treatment lay between those seen with Traditional Chinese Medicine and Western medicine treatments. Although only 6.82 % of patients with allergic rhinitis chose integrated Chinese-Western medicine treatment, the visit frequency per person-year of integrated Chinese-Western medicine ranked highest. In addition, multiple-composition medicines were used more frequently than single-composition medicines, and mar huang (Ephedra sinica Stapf) was seldom used to decrease the risk of combining medications.

27354219|t|TLR9 Deficiency Leads to Accelerated Renal Disease and Myeloid Lineage Abnormalities in Pristane -Induced Murine Lupus
27354219|a|Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, life-threatening autoimmune disorder, leading to multiple organ pathologies and kidney destruction. Analyses of numerous murine models of spontaneous SLE have revealed a critical role for endosomal TLRs in the production of autoantibodies and development of other clinical disease manifestations. Nevertheless, the corresponding TLR9 - deficient autoimmune -prone strains consistently develop more severe disease pathology. Injection of BALB/c mice with 2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane (TMPD), commonly known as pristane, also results in the development of SLE-like disease. We now show that Tlr9(-/-) BALB/c mice injected i.p. with TMPD develop more severe autoimmunity than do their TLR -sufficient cohorts. Early indications include an increased accumulation of TLR7 - expressing Ly6C(hi) inflammatory monocytes at the site of injection, upregulation of IFN -regulated gene expression in the peritoneal cavity, and an increased production of myeloid lineage precursors (common myeloid progenitors and granulocyte myeloid precursors) in the bone marrow. TMPD - injected Tlr9(-/-) BALB/c mice develop higher autoantibody titers against RNA, neutrophil cytoplasmic Ags, and myeloperoxidase than do TMPD - injected wild-type BALB/c mice. The TMP - injected Tlr9(-/-) mice, and not the wild-type mice, also develop a marked increase in glomerular IgG deposition and infiltrating granulocytes, much more severe glomerulonephritis, and a reduced lifespan. Collectively, the data point to a major role for TLR7 in the response to self-antigens in this model of experimental autoimmunity. Therefore, the BALB/c pristane model recapitulates other TLR7 -driven spontaneous models of SLE and is negatively regulated by TLR9.

27354640|t|Effect of Xenotransplantation Site on MicroRNA Expression of Human Colon Cancer Stem Cells
27354640|a|Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have a high tumorigenic ability to form patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDXs). PDXs are an attractive pre-clinical model, but gene expression and biological behavior of cancer cells in the tumor will change during establishment and passage of PDXs. Human colon cancer PDX was established and passaged either subcutaneously or orthotopically into the murine intestine. Histology and flow cytometric profile of the surgical specimen and the PDX were analyzed. CSCs were then isolated from the tumors and their microRNA (miRNA) expression was analyzed by semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The surgical specimens and PDXs were histologically similar. The size of CSC population increased and expression of miRNA s in CSCs changed in the passaged PDXs. Expression of oncogenic miRNAs was highly up-regulated in the CSCs of the orthotopically passaged PDXs. The xenotransplantation site and the number of tumor passages affect the miRNA expression of human colon CSCs.

27355356|t|Chemosensitivity, Cardiovascular Risk, and the Ventilatory Response to Exercise in COPD
27355356|a|COPD is associated with elevated cardiovascular risk and a potentiated ventilatory response to exercise. Enhanced carotid chemoreceptor (CC) activity / sensitivity is present in other clinical conditions, has been shown to contribute to sympathetic vasoconstrictor outflow, and is predictive of mortality. CC activity / sensitivity, and the resulting functional significance, has not been well examined in COPD. We hypothesized that CC activity / sensitivity would be elevated in COPD, and related to increased pulse wave velocity (a marker of CV risk) and the ventilatory response to exercise. 30 COPD patients and 10 healthy age-matched controls were examined. Participants performed baseline cardiopulmonary exercise and pulmonary function testing. CC activity was later evaluated by the drop in ventilation with breathing 100% O2, and CC sensitivity was then assessed by the ventilatory response to hypoxia (ΔVE/ΔS pO2). Peripheral arterial stiffness was subsequently evaluated by measurement of pulse wave velocity (PWV) using applanation tonometry while the subjects were breathing room air, and then following chemoreceptor inhibition by breathing 100% O2 for 2 minutes. CC activity, CC sensitivity, PWV and the ventilatory response to exercise were all increased in COPD relative to controls. CC sensitivity was related to PWV; however, neither CC activity nor CC sensitivity was related to the ventilatory response to exercise in COPD. CC inhibition by breathing 100% O2 normalized PWV in COPD, while no effect was observed in controls. CC activity and sensitivity are elevated in COPD, and appear related to cardiovascular risk; however, CC activity / sensitivity does not contribute to the potentiated ventilatory response to exercise.

27356972|t|Isolation of Cells Specialized in Anticancer Alkaloid Metabolism by Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting
27356972|a|Plant specialized metabolism often presents a complex cell - specific compartmentation essential to accomplish the biosynthesis of valuable plant natural products. Hence, the disclosure and potential manipulation of such pathways may depend on the capacity to isolate and characterize specific cell types. Catharanthus roseus is the source of several medicinal terpenoid indole alkaloids, including the low-level anticancer vinblastine and vincristine, for which the late biosynthetic steps occur in specialized mesophyll cells called idioblasts. Here, the optical, fluorescence, and alkaloid - accumulating properties of C. roseus leaf idioblasts are characterized, and a methodology for the isolation of idioblast protoplasts by fluorescence-activated cell sorting is established, taking advantage of the distinctive autofluorescence of these cells. This achievement represents a crucial step for the development of differential omic strategies leading to the identification of candidate genes putatively involved in the biosynthesis, pathway regulation, and transmembrane transport leading to the anticancer alkaloids from C. roseus.

27357217|t|Interaction of the Antimicrobial Peptides Rhesus θ-Defensin and Porcine Protegrin-1 with Anionic Phospholipid Monolayers
27357217|a|A combination of Langmuir isotherm, Brewster angle microscopy (BAM), and neutron reflectivity studies have been performed to gain insight into the effects on model bacterial cell membranes of the antimicrobial peptides, Rhesus θ-defensin 1 (RTD-1), and porcine protegrin 1 (PG-1). The peptides were interacted with monolayers spread at the air - water interface and prepared from a 3:1 molar mixture of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol used to approximate the cell membranes of Gram positive bacteria. The Langmuir film balance measurements show that both peptides perturb the lipid monolayers causing an increase in surface pressure, and the BAM studies show that each results in the formation of small domains within the lipid films, around 5 μm diameter. The overall change in monolayer surface pressure caused by PG-1, however, is a little more pronounced than that due to RTD-1 (+8.5 mN·m(-1) vs +5.5 mN·m(-1)), and the rate of its initial interaction with the monolayer is a little more rapid than that for RTD-1. The neutron reflectivity studies also show differences for PG-1 and RTD-1, with the model fits to these data showing that the more amphiphilic PG-1 becomes fully embedded within the lipid film -causing an extension of the lipid acyl chains but leaving the thickness of the lipid headgroup layer unaffected-while RTD-1 is seen to insert less deeply-causing the same extension of the lipid acyl chains as PG-1 but also causing a significant increase in thickness of the lipid headgroup layer. The various differing effects of the two peptides on anionic lipid monolayers are discussed in the context of their differing hemolytic activities, and their proposed differing propensities to form transmembrane pores.

27357607|t|Development of chrysin loaded poloxamer micelles and toxicity evaluation in fish embryos
27357607|a|Poloxamer micelles promise safety and efficacy for many water insoluble drugs. Chrysin has been reported to have anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-aromatase activities but its water insoluble properties limit its pharmaceutical application. In the present study, chrysin loaded poloxamer micelles were developed. Two types of poloxamers, Pluronic F-68 and Pluronic F-127 were compared. It was found that chrysin loaded Pluronic F-68 micelles (CS-P68) and chrysin loaded Pluronic F-127 micelles (CS-P127) obviously increase the aqueous solubility of chrysin. The results also indicated that the type of polymer and ratio of drug to polymer affected size and desirable characteristics of the micelles. The micelle system of CS-P68 and CS-P127 formed at drug to polymer ratios of 1:4 and 1:2, respectively, was found to be the most suitable monodispersed system with a nanosize-range diameter. The in vivo study in zebrafish eggs indicates that the toxicity of CS-P68 and CS-P127 is a dose response. CS-P68 and CS-P127 at a drug dose of 10 ng/mL or less is safe for zebrafish embryo growth. The results of this study indicate enhanced water solubility of chrysin. Chrysin loaded poloxamer micelles are promising for further use in in vivo studies in mammalian animals and humans.

27357626|a|Adoptive T-cell transfer is a promising treatment approach for metastatic cancer, but efficacy in solid tumors has only been achieved with toxic pre- and postconditioning regimens. Thus, adoptive T-cell therapies would benefit from complementary modalities that enable their full potential without excessive toxicity. We aimed to improve the efficacy and safety of adoptive T-cell transfer by using adenoviral vectors for direct delivery of immunomodulatory murine cytokines into B16.OVA melanoma tumors with concomitant T-cell receptor transgenic OT-I T-cell transfer. Armed adenoviruses expressed high local and low systemic levels of cytokine when injected into B16.OVA tumors, suggesting safety of virus-mediated cytokine delivery. Antitumor efficacy was significantly enhanced with adenoviruses coding for murine interleukin-2 (mIL-2) and tumor necrosis factor-α (mTNFα) when compared with T-cell transfer alone or viruses alone. Further improvement in efficacy was achieved with a triple combination of mIL-2, mTNFα, and OT-I T-cells. Mechanistic studies suggest that mIL-2 has an important role in activating T-cells at the tumor, while mTNFα induces chemokine expression. Furthermore, adenovirus treatments enhanced tumor - infiltration of OT-I T-cells as demonstrated by SPECT/CT imaging of (111)In-labeled cells. Our results suggest the utility of cytokine-coding adenoviruses for improving the efficacy of adoptive T-cell therapies.

27363786|t|The Maternal Legacy: Female Identity Predicts Offspring Sex Ratio in the Loggerhead Sea Turtle
27363786|a|In organisms with temperature-dependent sex determination, the incubation environment plays a key role in determining offspring sex ratios. Given that global temperatures have warmed approximately 0.6 °C in the last century, it is necessary to consider how organisms will adjust to climate change. To better understand the degree to which mothers influence the sex ratios of their offspring, we use 24 years of nesting data for individual female loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) observed on Bald Head Island, North Carolina. We find that maternal identity is the best predictor of nest sex ratio in univariate and multivariate predictive models. We find significant variability in estimated nest sex ratios among mothers, but a high degree of consistency within mothers, despite substantial spatial and temporal thermal variation. Our results suggest that individual differences in nesting preferences are the main driver behind divergences in nest sex ratios. As such, a female's ability to plastically adjust her nest sex ratios in response to environmental conditions is constrained, potentially limiting how individuals behaviorally mitigate the effects of environmental change. Given that many loggerhead populations already show female-biased offspring sex ratios, understanding maternal behavioral responses is critical for predicting the future of long-lived species vulnerable to extinction.

27364501|t|Increased RhoA Activity Predicts Worse Overall Survival in Patients Undergoing Surgical Resection for Lauren Diffuse-Type Gastric Adenocarcinoma
27364501|a|Several studies have reported a high rate of RHOA mutations in the Lauren diffuse-type gastric adenocarcinoma (GA) but not in intestinal-type GA. The aim of this study was to determine if RhoA activity is prognostic for overall survival (OS) in patients with resectable GA. Retrospective review was performed on a prospective database of GA patients who underwent potentially curative resection between 2003 and 2012 at a single institution. Tissue microarrays were constructed from surgical specimens and analyzed for phosphorylated RhoA, a marker of inactive RhoA signaling. OS was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and multivariate analysis was performed by Cox proportional hazards regression modeling. One hundred thirty-six patients with diffuse-type GA and 129 patients with intestinal-type GA were examined. Compared to intestinal-type GA, diffuse-type GA tumors were significantly associated with increased tumor size and advanced tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) classification system stage. In patients with diffuse-type GA, high RhoA activity was associated with significantly worse OS when compared to low RhoA activity (5-year OS 52.5 vs. 81.0 %, p = 0.017). This difference in OS was not observed in patients with intestinal-type GA (5-year OS 83.9 vs. 81.6 %, p = 0.766). On multivariate analysis of diffuse-type GA patients, high RhoA activity was an independent negative prognostic factor for OS (hazard ratio 2.38, 95 % confidence interval 1.07-5.28). Increased RhoA activity is predictive of worse OS in patients with diffuse-type GA who undergo potentially curative surgical resection. Along with findings from genomic studies, these results suggest RhoA may be a novel therapeutic target in diffuse-type GA.

27364610|t|Doxifluridine - conjugated 2-5A analog shows strong RNase L activation ability and tumor suppressive effect
27364610|a|RNase L is activated by 2',5'-oligoadenylates (2-5A) at subnanomolar levels to cleave single-stranded RNA. We previously reported the hypothesis that the introduction of an 8-methyladenosine residue at the 2'- terminus of the 2-5A tetramer shifts the 2-5A binding site of RNase L. In this study, we synthesized various 5'- modified 2-5A analog s with 8-methyladenosine at the 2'- terminus. The doxifluridine - conjugated 8-methyladenosine - substituted 2-5A analog was significantly more effective as an activator of RNase L than the parent 5'- monophophorylated 2-5A tetramer and showed a tumor suppressive effect against human cervical cancer cells.

27366508|t|Does Video Laryngoscopy Offer Advantages over Direct Laryngoscopy during Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation?
27366508|a|Interruption of chest compressions should be minimized because of its negative effects on survival. This randomized, controlled, cross-over study aimed to analyze the effectiveness of Macintosh, Miller, McCoy and McGrath laryngoscopes during with or without chest compressions in the scope of a simulated cardiopulmonary resuscitation scenario. The time required for successful tracheal intubation, number of attempts, dental trauma severity and the need for optimization manoeuvres were recorded during cardiopulmonary resuscitation with and without chest compressions. The experience with computer games during the last 10 years were asked to the participants and recorded. McCoy laryngoscope yielded the shortest time for successful tracheal intubation both in the presence of and without chest compressions. During the use of McCoy laryngoscopes, fewer tracheal intubation attempts, lower incidence of dental trauma and lower visual analogue scale scores on the ease of intubation were recorded. Participants who are experienced computer game players using Macintosh, McCoy and McGrath achieved successful tracheal intubation in a significantly shorter time during resuscitation without chest compressions. Dental trauma incidence and number of tracheal intubation attempts did not show any significant difference between the four laryngoscopes being related to the rate of playing computer games. McGrath video laryngoscopes do not appear to have advantages over direct laryngoscopes for securing a smooth and successful tracheal intubation during rhythmic chest compressions. We believe that as McCoy laryngoscope provided tracheal intubation in a shorter time and with fewer attempts, this laryngoscope may increase the success rate of resuscitation.

27371819|t|The nurse-patient communication: voices from nursing students
27371819|a|Effective communication skills have been found to be one of the pivotal factors in building positive interpersonal relationships. Little is known about nursing undergraduates ' perspectives on communicating with patients. This study aimed to explore nursing students' perspectives and experiences of nurse-patient communication in their clinical placement. The participants included 21 second-year undergraduates and 21 first-year master's students. Interviews were conducted in Cantonese and then transcribed in Chinese and translated into English. A content analysis approach was adopted to analyze the data. Five themes emerged from the interview data. 'The necessity of nurse-patient communication ' reveals why the students valued nurse-patient communication. 'The conversation contents ' describes the content of the conversations that students typically had with patients. The third theme is ' self-reflection on the nurse-patient communication '. The last two themes, 'the communication pattern in different hospital settings ' and 'the obstacles impeding nurse-patient communication ', are about the students' communication styles in different hospitals and the barriers they encounter. To improve students' communication skills, educators and clinical staff should listen to students, enhance students' reflective skills and strengthen their confidence. Through understanding students' difficulties in the nurse-patient communication experience and the skills that they lack, educators can provide them with helpful recommendations to improve their communication skills in clinical practice. The results of this study reveal that students' nurse-patient communication skills need to be improved.

27374165|t|Early hippocampal volume loss as a marker of eventual memory deficits caused by repeated stress
27374165|a|Exposure to severe and prolonged stress has detrimental effects on the hippocampus. However, relatively little is known about the gradual changes in hippocampal structure, and its behavioral consequences, over the course of repeated stress. Behavioral analyses during 10 days of chronic stress pointed to a delayed decline in spatial memory, the full impact of which is evident only after the end of stress. In contrast, concurrent volumetric measurements in the same animals revealed significant reduction in hippocampal volumes in stressed animals relative to their unstressed counterparts, as early as the third day of stress. Notably, animals that were behaviorally the worst affected at the end of chronic stress suffered the most pronounced early loss in hippocampal volume. Together, these findings support the view that not only is smaller hippocampal volume linked to stress - induced memory deficits, but it may also act as an early risk factor for the eventual development of cognitive impairments seen in stress-related psychiatric disorders.

27375918|t|The Association between C9orf72 Repeats and Risk of Alzheimer's Disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Meta-Analysis
27375918|a|C9orf72 is the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) in Caucasian populations. However, the relationship between C9orf72 repeats and Alzheimer's disease (AD) was not clear. Additionally, there were few articles assessing C9orf72 in other ethnicities with ALS. In this meta-analysis, we aimed to investigate the relationship between C9orf72 repeat expansions (≥30 repeats) and intermediate repeat copies (20-29 repeats) and AD or ALS. The results suggested positive correlations between C9orf72 repeat expansions and the risk of Alzheimer's disease (OR = 6.36, 95% CI = 3.13-12.92, and p < 0.00001), while intermediate repeat copies of C9orf72 gene were not associated with the risk of the disease. C9orf72 repeat expansions were positively correlated with the risk of familial and sporadic ALS (OR = 293.25, 95% CI = 148.17-580.38, and p < 0.00001; OR = 35.57, 95% CI = 19.61-64.51, and p < 0.00001). There was a positive correlation between the gene variations and ALS risk among Caucasians and Asians (OR = 57.56, 95% CI = 36.73-90.22, and p < 0.00001; OR = 6.35, 95% CI = 1.39-29.02, and p = 0.02).

27378028|t|Demonstration and validation of a new pressure -based MRI -safe pain tolerance device
27378028|a|One of the barriers to studying the behavioral and emotional effects of pain using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is the absence of a commercially available, MRI - compatible, pressure -based algometer to elicit pain. The present study sought to address this barrier through creation and validation of a novel MRI -safe apparatus capable of delivering incremental, measurable amounts of pressure inside a scanning bore. We introduced an MR-safe device used to administer pressure -based pain. To test against a commercially available, MRI - incompatible algometer (AlgoMed), 199 participants reported their pain tolerance for both devices. A second experiment tested the validity of pressure -based pain in an MRI environment by comparing brain activation with established neural networks for pain. 10 participants performed an identical procedure to test for pain tolerance while being scanned in a 7T MRI scanner. Results support the validity and reliability of our novel device. In Study 1, pain tolerance with this device was strongly correlated with pain tolerance as measured by a commercially available algometer (r=0.78). In Study 2, this device yielded BOLD activation within the insula (BA 13) and anterior cingulate gyrus (BA 24); as pressure increased, activation in these areas parametrically increased. These findings correspond to other studies using thermal, electrical, or mechanical pain applications. Behavioral and functional data demonstrate that this new device is a valid method of administering pressure -related pain in MRI environments. Our novel MRI -safe device is a valid instrument to measure and administer pressure -based pain.

27378927|t|Anti-Inflammatory Properties of Menthol and Menthone in Schistosoma mansoni Infection
27378927|a|Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by several species of trematode worms and it is believed that more than 261 million people are affected worldwide. New drug development has become essential because there is a risk of the parasite becoming resistant to Praziquantel, the only drug available for this infection. This study evaluated parasitological, immunological and histological parameters in mice infected with Schistosoma mansoni and treated with an herbal commercial medicine. This drug consists of menthol (30-55%) and menthone (14-32%). A 60 day treatment regimen with the herbal medicine decreased the number of S. mansoni eggs in the feces, liver, and intestine and reduced the number of hepatic granulomas. We observed a reduction of 84% in blood eosinophilia and a decrease in the IL-4 and IL-10 blood levels after treatment. Therefore, we propose that schistosomiasis treatment with this herbal medicine for 60 days has an immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory action in this animal model for schistosomiasis thus contributing to the decrease in physio pathological effects caused by S. mansoni infection.

27381206|t|Catastrophic health expenditure: a comparative analysis of empty-nest and non-empty-nest households with seniors in Shandong, China
27381206|a|The aim of this study was to compare the catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) prevalence and its determinants between empty-nest and non-empty-nest elderly households. Shandong province of China. A total of 2761 elderly households are included in the analysis. CHE incidence among elderly households was 44.9%. The CHE incidence of empty-nest singles (59.3%, p=0.000, OR=3.19) and empty-nest couples (52.9%, p=0.000, OR=2.45) are both statistically higher than that of non-empty-nest elderly households (31.4%). An inverse association was observed between CHE incidence and income level in all elderly household types. Factors including 1 or more household elderly members with non-communicable chronic diseases in the past 6 months, 1 or more elderly household members being hospitalised in the past year and lower household income, are significant risk factors for CHE in all 3 household types (p<0.05). Health insurance status was found to be a significant determinant of CHE among empty-nest singles and non-empty-nest households (p<0.05). CHE incidence among elderly households is high in China. Empty-nest households are at higher risk for CHE than non-empty-nest households. Based on these findings, we suggest that special insurance be developed to broaden the coverage of health services and heighten the reimbursement rate for empty-nest elderly in the existing health insurance schemes. Financial and social protection interventions are also essential for identifie d at-risk subgroups among different types of elderly households.

27381670|t|Role of agonistic autoantibodies against type-1 angiotensin II receptor in the pathogenesis of retinopathy in preeclampsia
27381670|a|To investigate the mechanism underlying AT1-AA -induced retinopathy in severe preeclampsia by measuring the positive rate and titer of AT1-AA in plasma from women with severe preeclampsia and normal pregnant women to see whether AT1-AA titer was correlated with the grade of retinopathy. A preeclampsia rat model was also established by intravenous injection of AT1-AA extracted from the plasma of patient suffering from severe preeclampsia. The results showed that the plasma titer and positive rate of AT1-AA were significantly higher in women with severe preeclampsia than normal pregnant women. The antibody titer in cases of severe preeclampsia was associated with the grade of retinopathy, and positively correlated with the level of TNF-α and VEGF. The animal experiment results showed that the modeled rats presented symptoms very similar to symptoms of human preeclampsia, including retinopathy. Ocular fundus examination showed retinal microvascular abnormalities, hemorrhaging and leakage in the severe preeclampsia. Morphological changes included edema, thickening of the INL and ONL, and pigment atrophy. TNF-α and VEGF levels were increased in the vitreous humor and retina of the model rats. Our studies results suggest that abnormal expression of AT1-AA could induce damage to retinal capillary endothelial cells and increase vascular permeability, resulting in retinopathy.

27382289|t|Characterizing sexual function in patients with generalized anxiety disorder: a pooled analysis of three vilazodone studies
27382289|a|Vilazodone has been shown to reduce core symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Since sexual dysfunction (SD) is not well characterized in GAD, a post hoc analysis of these trials was conducted to evaluate the effects of vilazodone on sexual functioning in GAD patients. Data were pooled from one fixed-dose trial of vilazodone 20 and 40 mg/day (NCT01629966) and two flexible-dose studies of vilazodone 20-40 mg/day (NCT01766401, NCT01844115) in adults with GAD. Sexual functioning was assessed using the Changes in Sexual Functioning Questionnaire (CSFQ). Outcomes included mean change from baseline to end of treatment (EOT) in CSFQ total score and percentage of patients shifting from SD at baseline (CSFQ total score ≤47 for males, ≤41 for females) to normal functioning at EOT. Treatment-emergent adverse events related to sexual functioning were also analyzed. A total of 1,373 patients were included in the analyses. SD at baseline was more common in females (placebo, 46.4%; vilazodone, 49%) than in males (placebo, 35.1%; vilazodone, 40.9%). CSFQ total score improvement was found in both females (placebo, +1.2; vilazodone, +1.6) and males (placebo, +2.1; vilazodone, +1.0), with no statistically significant differences between treatment groups. The percentage of patients who shifted from SD at baseline to normal sexual functioning at EOT was higher in males (placebo, 40.6%; vilazodone, 35.7%) than in females (placebo, 24.9%; vilazodone, 34.9%); no statistical testing was performed. Except for erectile dysfunction and delayed ejaculation in vilazodone - treated males (2.4% and 2.1%, respectively), no treatment-emergent adverse events related to sexual functioning occurred in ≥2% of patients in either treatment group. Approximately 35%-50% of patients in the vilazodone GAD studies had SD at baseline. Vilazodone and placebo had similar effects on CSFQ outcomes in both females and males, indicating a limited adverse impact on sexual functioning with vilazodone.

27385165|t|Biogeochemical Controls of Uranium Bioavailability from the Dissolved Phase in Natural Freshwaters
27385165|a|To gain insights into the risks associated with uranium (U) mining and processing, we investigated the biogeochemical controls of U bioavailability in the model freshwater species Lymnaea stagnalis (Gastropoda). Bioavailability of dissolved U(VI) was characterized in controlled laboratory experiments over a range of water hardness, pH, and in the presence of complexing ligands in the form of dissolved natural organic matter (DOM). Results show that dissolved U is bioavailable under all the geochemical conditions tested. Uranium uptake rates follow first order kinetics over a range encompassing most environmental concentrations. Uranium uptake rates in L. stagnalis ultimately demonstrate saturation uptake kinetics when exposure concentrations exceed 100 nM, suggesting uptake via a finite number of carriers or ion channels. The lack of a relationship between U uptake rate constants and Ca uptake rates suggest that U does not exclusively use Ca membrane transporters. In general, U bioavailability decreases with increasing pH, increasing Ca and Mg concentrations, and when DOM is present. Competing ions did not affect U uptake rates. Speciation modeling that includes formation constants for U ternary complexes reveals that the aqueous concentration of dicarbonato U species (UO2(CO3)2(-2)) best predicts U bioavailability to L. stagnalis, challenging the free-ion activity model postulate.

27386263|t|Interleukin-21 plays a critical role in the pathogenesis and severity of type I autoimmune hepatitis
27386263|a|Recently, the number of follicular helper T (Tfh) cells expressing interleukin (IL)-21 was found to increase in peripheral blood of human and murine models of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). IL-21, the most recently discovered member of the type-I cytokine family, exerts various effects on the immune system, including B cell activation, plasma cell differentiation, and immunoglobulin production. We aimed to assess the relationship of serum IL-21 levels in patients with type I AIH with clinical and laboratory parameters and histology. Ninety-two Japanese patients with liver disease (22 AIH, 20 primary biliary cholangitis, 19 drug-induced liver injury, 8 acute hepatitis B, 8 chronic hepatitis C, 10 non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, 5 viral hepatitis) and 10 healthy volunteers were recruited. Serum IL-21 levels were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Real-time polymerase chain reaction measured mRNA levels of Bcl-6, IL-21, and CXCR5 (Tfh-related factors) in peripheral mononuclear cells. Mean age at diagnosis of AIH was 58.6 years, male-to-female ratio was 4:18, 18.2 % of participants had cirrhosis, and 22.7 % had severe disease. IL-21 levels were significantly increased in the serum of patients with AIH compared to those with other liver diseases and controls (p < 0.0001). Particularly, serum IL-21 levels were significantly increased in severe AIH cases compared to non-severe cases (p < 0.05). Serum IL-21 levels correlated positively with total serum bilirubin levels (r = 0.46, p < 0.05), grading of necroinflammatory activity (r = 0.68, p < 0.005) and negatively with serum albumin levels in patients with AIH (r = -0.49, p < 0.05). In patients with biochemical remission of AIH, serum IL-21 levels remained elevated and correlated positively with serum IgG levels (r = 0.84, p < 0.01). Expression of Tfh-related factors, such as Bcl-6 and IL-21, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with AIH was significantly higher than that in healthy volunteers. IL-21 may play an important role in the pathogenesis and severity of AIH, and may present a promising target for AIH therapy.

27388962|t|Resistance Exercise in Pregnancy and Outcome
27388962|a|As the health benefits of exercise are increasingly recognized, the traditional advice to rest during pregnancy has changed toward a more healthy and active pregnancy, therefore different forms of exercise have been integrated into the life of the pregnant woman. Although the benefits of using a combination of resistance and aerobic exercises are not yet determined, studies about resistance and strengthen training programs are few although no adverse outcomes were reported.

27390504|t|Custom ocular prosthesis in rehabilitation of a child operated for retinoblastoma
27390504|a|A maxillofacial prosthodontist forms an important link in the interdisciplinary management of a patient with anopthalmosis. Prosthetic management of an anopthalmic defect aims to deliver a well-fitting ocular prosthesis that can mimic the original eye as closely as possible, and thus restoring the patient's self-confidence and thereby rehabilitating them in the society. The fabrication of a custom ocular prosthesis is a demanding art. This case report presents a simplified technique for the fabrication of a custom ocular prosthesis for a child who had lost his eye to enucleation following retinoblastoma. Early and effective rehabilitation of the defect goes a long way in restoring the self-image of a child in its early character building age.

27390849|t|Pulmonary function and health-related quality of life 1- year follow up after cardiac surgery
27390849|a|Pulmonary function is severely reduced in the early period after cardiac surgery, and impairments have been described up to 4-6 months after surgery. Evaluation of pulmonary function in a longer perspective is lacking. In this prospective study pulmonary function and health-related quality of life were investigated 1 year after cardiac surgery. Pulmonary function measurements, health-related quality of life (SF-36), dyspnoea, subjective breathing and coughing ability and pain were evaluated before and 1 year after surgery in 150 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, valve surgery or combined surgery. One year after surgery the forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in 1 s were significantly decreased (by 4-5 %) compared to preoperative values (p < 0.05). Saturation of peripheral oxygen was unchanged 1 year postoperatively compared to baseline. A significantly improved health-related quality of life was found 1 year after surgery, with improvements in all eight aspects of SF-36 (p < 0.001). Sternotomy -related pain was low 1 year postoperatively at rest (median 0 [min-max; 0-7]), while taking a deep breath (0 [0-4]) and while coughing (0 [0-8]). A more pronounced decrease in pulmonary function was associated with dyspnoea limitations and impaired subjective breathing and coughing ability. One year after cardiac surgery static and dynamic lung function measurements were slightly decreased, while health-related quality of life was improved in comparison to preoperative values. Measured levels of pain were low and saturation of peripheral oxygen was same as preoperatively.

27391592|t|Impact of Soil Salinity on the Structure of the Bacterial Endophytic Community Identified from the Roots of Caliph Medic (Medicago truncatula)
27391592|a|In addition to being a forage crop, Caliph medic (Medicago truncatula) is also a model legume plant and is used for research focusing on the molecular characterization of the interaction between rhizobia and plants. However, the endophytic microbiome in this plant is poorly defined. Endophytic bacteria play a role in supplying plants with the basic requirements necessary for growth and development. Moreover, these bacteria also play a role in the mechanism of salinity stress adaptation in plants. As a prelude to the isolation and utilization of these bacteria in Caliph medic farming, 41 bacterial OTUs were identified in this project from within the interior of the roots of this plant by pyrosequencing of the small ribosomal subunit gene (16S rDNA) using a cultivation-independent approach. In addition, the differential abundance of these bacteria was studied following exposure of the plants to salinity stress. About 29,064 high-quality reads were obtained from the sequencing of six libraries prepared from control and salinity-treated tissues. Statistical analysis revealed that the abundance of ~70% of the OTUs was significantly (p ≤ 0.05) altered in roots that were exposed to salinity stress. Sequence analysis showed a similarity between some of the identified species and other, known, growth-promoting bacteria, marine and salt-stressed soil-borne bacteria, and nitrogen-fixing bacterial isolates. Determination of the amendments to the bacteria l community due to salinity stress in Caliph medic provides a crucial step toward developing an understanding of the association of these endophytes, under salt stress conditions, in this model plant. To provide direct evidence regarding their growth promoting activity, a group of endophytic bacteria were isolated from inside of plant roots using a cultivation-dependent approach. Several of these isolates were able to produce ACC-deaminase, ammonia and IAA; and to solubilize Zn+2 and PO4-3. This data is consistent with the predicted occurrence (based on cultivation-independent techniques) of these bacteria and provides some insight into the importance of the endophytic bacteria in Caliph medic when grown under normal and saline conditions.

27393222|t|Crocetin improves the quality of in vitro - produced bovine embryos: Implications for blastocyst development, cryotolerance, and apoptosis
27393222|a|The aim of this work was to assess the effect of supplementation of bovine culture medium with the natural antioxidant crocetin on in vitro blastocyst development and quality. This was evaluated as cryotolerance, apoptosis index, and total cells number and allocation. Abattoir -derived oocytes were matured and fertilized in vitro according to standard procedure. Twenty hours after IVF, presumptive zygotes were cultured in synthetic oviduct fluid medium, supplemented with 0, 1, 2.5, and 5 μM crocetin (experiment 1) at 39 °C under humidified air with 5% CO2, 7% O2, and 88% N2. On Day 7, embryo yields were assessed and the blastocysts were vitrified by Cryotop method in 16.5% ethylene glycol, 16.5% DMSO, and 0.5 M sucrose. Finally, blastocysts produced on Day 8 in the absence (control) and presence of 1 μM crocetin were used for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labelling and differential staining to evaluate, respectively, the apoptotic rate and the allocation of cells into inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE) lineages (experiment 2). Embryo development was higher in the 1 μM crocetin group compared to the control, both in terms of total embryo output (37.7 ± 4.2%, 52.9 ± 6.3%, 40.9 ± 7.6%, and 42.4 ± 8.7%, respectively, with 0, 1, 2.5, and 5 μM; P < 0.01) and grade 1 and 2 blastocysts (33.6 ± 4.9%, 46.1 ± 7.3%, 37.8 ± 7.9%, and 39.4 ± 7.9%, respectively, with 0, 1, 2.5, and 5 μM; P < 0.05). Moreover, the percentage of fast-developing embryos increased in 1 μM crocetin group compared to the control (23.4 ± 4.7%, 32.7 ± 6.6%, 27.2 ± 6.6%, and 30.1 ± 7.2%, respectively, with 0, 1, 2.5, and 5 μM; P < 0.05). In addition, the enrichment of culture medium with 1 μM crocetin improved embryo cryotolerance compared to the control, as indicated by higher hatching rates recorded after 48 hours postwarming culture (46.5% vs. 60.4%; P < 0.05). Furthermore, 1 μM crocetin decreased both the average number (9.9 ± 0.4 vs. 7.1 ± 0.3) and the percentage of apoptotic cells (7.1 ± 0.4 vs. 4.2 ± 0.2) in blastocysts compared to the control (P < 0.01). However, no differences were recorded in the average number of ICM, TE, and total cells between 1 μM crocetin and control groups. In conclusion, the enrichment of bovine culture medium with 1 μM crocetin increased both blastocyst yield and quality, as indicated by the improved chronology of embryo development, increased resistance to cryopreservation, and reduced incidence of apoptosis.

27401811|t|Matrix solid-phase dispersion combined to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for the determination of paraben preservatives in mollusks
27401811|a|A method for the extraction and determination of seven parabens, esters of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, widely used as preservatives in personal care products, pharmaceuticals, etc., and two chlorinated derivatives (mono- and di-chloro methyl paraben) from mollusk samples was developed by combining matrix solid-phase dispersion (MSPD) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. MSPD parameters, such as solvent, solid support and clean-up sorbent, were optimized. Besides, since blank problems were observed for some parabens, these were investigated and blanks were tackled by precleaning all sorbents prior to use. Under final conditions, 0.5g of freeze-dried mollusk were dispersed with 1.2g of silica and packed into a cartridge containing 3g of C18, as on-line clean-up sorbent. This cartridge was eluted with 10mL of acetonitrile, evaporated and reconstituted in methanol for analysis. In the validation stage, successful linearity (R(2)>0.999), recoveries (between 71 and 117% for most analytes), precision (RSD lower than 21%) and limits of detection and quantification (LOD and LOQ, lower than 0.4 and 1.4ngg(-1) dry weight respectively) levels were achieved. Finally, the new methodology was applied to mussel, clam and cockle samples. Methyl paraben was above the LOQ in five of the six samples (not found in one clam sample) at concentrations up to 7ngg(-1) dry weight. Ethyl paraben was found above the LOQ in mussel and cockle samples at a concentration level around 0.3ngg(-1). n-Propyl paraben was only above the LOQ in one mussel sample.

27402799|t|Two-stage reconstructive overlapping stent LEO+ and SILK for treatment of intracranial circumferential fusiform aneurysms in the posterior circulation
27402799|a|Intracranial circumferential fusiform aneurysms of the posterior circulation involving arterial branches or perforating vessels are difficult to treat. This article shows an endovascular reconstruction technique not yet described, using a telescoping self-expandable stent (LEO+) and flow-diverter device (SILK) at different surgical times. Two patients with circumferential fusiform aneurysm, one being an aneurysm of the segments P2 and P3 of the posterior cerebral artery, diagnosed after a headache, and the other a partially thrombosed aneurysm of the lower basilar artery, diagnosed following ischemia of the brain stem. Endovascular treatment was performed by means of a vascular reconstruction technique that used at different surgical times: overlapping; a telescoped self-expandable stent, LEO+; and a flow-diverter device, SILK. Angiographic control was carried out at 6 and 12 months, to evaluate arterial patency, flow maintenance in the arterial branches and perforating vessels, and thrombosis of the aneurysm. The combined use at different surgical times of the self-expandable stent and flow-diverter device was technically successful in both patients. There were no complications during the procedure, nor in the long-term follow-up with full arterial vascular reconstruction, maintenance of cerebral perfusion and complete aneurysm occlusion at the 6- and 12- month angiographic follow-up. There was no aneurysm recanalization nor intra-stent stenosis. Circumferential fusiform aneurysm of the posterior circulation involving arterial branches or perforating vessels to the brain stem may be treated with this arterial reconstruction technique at different surgical times, using the self-expandable stent called LEO+ and the flow-diverter device SILK, minimizing the risk of complications and failure of the endovascular technique, with the potential for arterial reconstruction with thrombosis of the aneurysmatic sac, as well as flow maintenance in the eloquent arteries, in this type of cerebral aneurysm.

27403678|t|Polysaccharide - Specific Memory B Cells Predict Protection against Experimental Human Pneumococcal Carriage
27403678|a|We have previously demonstrated that experimental pneumococcal carriage enhances immunity and protects healthy adults against carriage reacquisition after rechallenge with a homologous strain. To investigate the role of naturally acquired pneumococcal protein and polysaccharide (PS)- specific immunity in protection against carriage acquisition using a heterologous challenge model. We identified healthy volunteers that were naturally colonized with pneumococcus and, after clearance of their natural carriage episode, challenged them with a heterologous 6B strain. In another cohort of volunteers we assessed 6BPS - specific, PspA - specific, and PspC - specific IgG and IgA plasma and memory B-cell populations before and 7, 14, and 35 days after experimental pneumococcal inoculation. Heterologous challenge with 6B resulted in 50% carriage among volunteers with previous natural pneumococcal carriage. Protection from carriage was associated with a high number of circulating 6BPS IgG - secreting memory B cells at baseline. There were no associations between protection from carriage and baseline levels of 6BPS IgG in serum or nasal wash, PspA - specific, or PspC - specific memory B cells or plasma cells. In volunteers who did not develop carriage, the number of circulating 6BPS memory B cells decreased and the number of 6BPS plasma cells increased postinoculation. Our data indicate that naturally acquired PS - specific memory B cells, but not levels of circulating IgG at time of pneumococcal exposure, are associated with protection against carriage acquisition.

27405692|t|Hounsfield unit recovery in clinical cone beam CT images of the thorax acquired for image guided radiation therapy
27405692|a|A comprehensive artefact correction method for clinical cone beam CT (CBCT) images acquired for image guided radiation therapy (IGRT) on a commercial system is presented. The method is demonstrated to reduce artefacts and recover CT -like Hounsfield units (HU) in reconstructed CBCT images of five lung cancer patients. Projection image based artefact corrections of image lag, detector scatter, body scatter and beam hardening are described and applied to CBCT images of five lung cancer patients. Image quality is evaluated through visual appearance of the reconstructed images, HU -correspondence with the planning CT images, and total volume HU error. Artefacts are reduced and CT -like HUs are recovered in the artefact corrected CBCT images. Visual inspection confirms that artefacts are indeed suppressed by the proposed method, and the HU root mean square difference between reconstructed CBCTs and the reference CT images are reduced by 31% when using the artefact corrections compared to the standard clinical CBCT reconstruction. A versatile artefact correction method for clinical CBCT images acquired for IGRT has been developed. HU values are recovered in the corrected CBCT images. The proposed method relies on post processing of clinical projection images, and does not require patient specific optimisation. It is thus a powerful tool for image quality improvement of large numbers of CBCT images.

27407027|t|Risk Factors for Infection After Knee Arthroscopy: Analysis of 595,083 Cases From 3 United States Databases
27407027|a|To identify and quantify patient- and procedure-related risk factors for post-arthroscopic knee infections using a large dataset. An administrative health care database including 8 years of records from 2 large commercial insurers and Medicare (a 5% random sample) was queried to identify all knee arthroscopies performed on patients aged at least 15 years using Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes. Each CPT code was designated as a high- or low-complexity procedure, with the former typically requiring accessory incisions or increased operative time. Deep infections were identified by a CPT code for incision and drainage within 90 days of surgery. Superficial infections were identified by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision infection codes without any record of incision and drainage. Patients were compared based on age, sex, body mass index, tobacco use, presence of diabetes, and Charlson Comorbidity Index. A total of 526,537 patients underwent 595,083 arthroscopic knee procedures. Deep postoperative infections occurred at a rate of 0.22%. Superficial infections occurred at a rate of 0.29%. Tobacco use and morbid obesity were the largest risk factors for deep and superficial infections, respectively (P < .001; relative risk of 1.90 and 2.19, respectively). There were also higher infection rates among patients undergoing relatively high-complexity arthroscopies, men, obese patients, diabetic patients, and younger patients (in order of decreasing relative risk). Increased Charlson Comorbidity Index was associated with superficial and total infections (P < .001). Post-arthroscopic knee infections were more frequent among morbidly obese patients, tobacco users, patients undergoing relatively complex procedures, men, obese patients, diabetic patients, relatively young patients, and patients with increased comorbidity burdens in this study population. This knowledge may allow more informed preoperative counseling, aid surgeons in patient selection, and facilitate infection prevention by targeting individuals with higher inherent risk. Level IV, cross-sectional study.

27412368|t|Association of prenatal and early life exposure to tetrachloroethylene (PCE) with polycystic ovary syndrome and other reproductive disorders in the cape cod health study: A retrospective cohort study
27412368|a|Tetrachloroethylene (PCE) is an organic lipophilic solvent with possible neuroendocrine toxicity. The objective of this study was to determine the association of prenatal and early childhood exposure to PCE - contaminated drinking water and development of adult-onset Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), endometriosis, difficulty conceiving and miscarriage. Five-hundred exposed and 331 unexposed female participants born between 1969 and 1983 completed questionnaires on demographic and lifestyle characteristics, and reproductive disorders. Residential locations from the prenatal period through five years of age were used to estimate early life PCE exposure with water modeling software. For any early life exposure to PCE, the adjusted risk ratio for PCOS was 0.9 (95% CI: 0.5-1.6). No statistically significan t associations were observed for increasing levels of exposure with PCOS or the other reproductive disorders. No meaningful associations were found among adult women with early life exposure to PCE - contaminated drinking water and adult-onset reproductive disorders.

27412452|t|Host plant affects the sexual attractiveness of the female white-spotted longicorn beetle, Anoplophora malasiaca
27412452|a|Anoplophora malasiaca (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) is a serious pest that destroys various landscape and crop trees in Japan. We evaluated the precopulatory responses of three different A. malasiaca populations collected from mandarin orange, willow and blueberry trees. Most of the males accepted mates from within the same host plant population as well as females from the willow and blueberry populations. However, significant number of males from the blueberry and willow populations rejected females from the mandarin orange population immediately after touching them with their antennae. Because all three of the female populations produced contact sex pheromones on their elytra, the females of the mandarin orange population were predicted to possess extra chemicals that repelled the males of the other two populations. β-Elemene was identified as a key component that was only found in mandarin orange -fed females and induced a rejection response in willow -fed males. Our results represent the first example of a female -acquired repellent against conspecific males of different host plant populations, indicating that the host plant greatly affects the female's sexual attractiveness.

27412759|t|Molecular detection of infection homogeneity and impact of miltefosine treatment in a Syrian golden hamster model of Leishmania donovani and L. infantum visceral leishmaniasis
27412759|a|Control of visceral leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania infantum and Leishmania donovani primarily relies on chemotherapy using an increasingly compromised repertoire of antileishmanial compounds. For evaluation of novel drugs, the Syrian golden hamster is considered as a clinically relevant laboratory model. In this study, two molecular parasite detection assays were developed targeting cathepsin-like cysteine protease B (CPB) DNA and 18S rRNA to achieve absolute amastigote quantification in the major target organs liver and spleen. Both quantitative PCR (qPCR) techniques showed excellent agreement with a strong correlation with the conventional microscopic reading of Giemsa-stained tissue smears. Using multiple single tissue pieces and all three detection methods, we confirmed homogeneity of infection in liver and spleen and the robustness of extrapolating whole organ burdens from a small single tissue piece. Comparison of pre - and post-treatment burdens in infected hamsters using the three detection methods consistently revealed a stronger parasite reduction in the spleen compared to the liver, indicating an organ - dependent clearance efficacy for miltefosine. In conclusion, this study in the hamster demonstrated high homogeneity of infection in liver and spleen and advocates the use of molecular detection methods for assessment of low (post-treatment) tissue burdens.

27415391|t|Approximate Bayesian computation for estimating number concentrations of monodisperse nanoparticles in suspension by optical microscopy
27415391|a|We present an approximate Bayesian computation scheme for estimating number concentrations of monodisperse diffusing nanoparticles in suspension by optical particle tracking microscopy. The method is based on the probability distribution of the time spent by a particle inside a detection region. We validate the method on suspensions of well-controlled reference particles. We illustrate its usefulness with an application in gene therapy, applying the method to estimate number concentrations of plasmid DNA molecules and the average number of DNA molecules complexed with liposomal drug delivery particles.

27417076|t|Gestational age specific stillbirth risk among Indigenous and non - Indigenous women in Queensland, Australia: a population based study
27417076|a|In Australia, significant disparity persists in stillbirth rates between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (Indigenous Australian) and non - Indigenous women. Diabetes, hypertension, antepartum haemorrhage and small-for-gestational age (SGA) have been identified as important contributors to higher rates among Indigenous women. The objective of this study was to examine gestational age specific risk of stillbirth associated with these conditions among Indigenous and non - Indigenous women. Retrospective population-based study of all singleton births of at least 20 weeks gestation or at least 400 grams birthweight in Queensland between July 2005 and December 2011 using data from the Queensland Perinatal Data Collection, which is a routinely-maintained database that collects data on all births in Queensland. Multivariate logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95 % confidence intervals, adjusting for maternal demographic and pregnancy factors. Of 360987 births analysed, 20273 (5.6 %) were to Indigenous women and 340714 (94.4 %) were to non - Indigenous women. Stillbirth rates were 7.9 (95 % CI 6.8-9.2) and 4.1 (95 % CI 3.9-4.3) per 1000 births, respectively. For both Indigenous and non - Indigenous women across most gestational age groups, antepartum haemorrhage, SGA, pre-existing diabetes and pre-existing hypertension were associated with increased risk of stillbirth. There were mixed results for pre-eclampsia and eclampsia and a consistently raised risk of stillbirth was not seen for gestational diabetes. This study highlights gestational age specific stillbirth risk for Indigenous and non - Indigenous women; and disparity in risk at term gestations. Improving access to and utilisation of appropriate and responsive healthcare may help to address disparities in stillbirth risk for Indigenous women.

27417211|t|Defining, Describing, and Categorizing Public Health Infrastructure Priorities for Tropical Cyclone, Flood, Storm, Tornado, and Tsunami-Related Disasters
27417211|a|The study aim was to undertake a qualitative research literature review to analyze available databases to define, describe, and categorize public health infrastructure (PHI) priorities for tropical cyclone, flood, storm, tornado, and tsunami-related disasters. Five electronic publication databases were searched to define, describe, or categorize PHI and discuss tropical cyclone, flood, storm, tornado, and tsunami-related disasters and their impact on PHI. The data were analyzed through aggregation of individual articles to create an overall data description. The data were grouped into PHI themes, which were then prioritized on the basis of degree of interdependency. Sixty-seven relevant articles were identified. PHI was categorized into 13 themes with a total of 158 descriptors. The highest priority PHI identified was workforce. This was followed by water, sanitation, equipment, communication, physical structure, power, governance, prevention, supplies, service, transport, and surveillance. This review identified workforce as the most important of the 13 thematic areas related to PHI and disasters. If its functionality fails, workforce has the greatest impact on the performance of health services. If addressed post-disaster, the remaining forms of PHI will then be progressively addressed. These findings are a step toward providing an evidence base to inform PHI priorities in the disaster setting. (Disaster Med Public Health Preparedness. 2016;10:598-610).

27418256|t|Fragment -Based Discovery of 5-Arylisatin -Based Inhibitors of Matrix Metalloproteinases 2 and 13
27418256|a|Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are well-established targets for several pathologies. In particular, MMP-2 and MMP-13 play a prominent role in cancer progression. In this study, a structure-based screening campaign was applied to prioritize metalloproteinase -oriented fragments. This computational model was applied to a representative fragment set from the publically available EDASA Scientific compound library. These fragments were prioritized, and the top-ranking hits were tested in a biological assay to validate the model. Two scaffolds showed consistent activity in the assay, and the isatin-based compounds were the most interesting. These latter fragments have significant potential as tools for the design and realization of novel MMP inhibitors. In addition to their micromolar activity, the chemical synthesis affords flexible and creative access to their analogues.

27428958|t|Transcriptome and Metabolome Analyses of Glucosinolates in Two Broccoli Cultivars Following Jasmonate Treatment for the Induction of Glucosinolate Defense to Trichoplusia ni (Hübner)
27428958|a|Lepidopteran larvae growth is influenced by host plant glucosinolate (GS) concentrations, which are, in turn, influenced by the phytohormone jasmonate (JA). In order to elucidate insect resistance biomarkers to lepidopteran pests, transcriptome and metabolome analyses following JA treatments were conducted with two broccoli cultivars, Green Magic and VI-158, which have differentially induced indole GSs, neoglucobrassicin and glucobrassicin, respectively. To test these two inducible GSs on growth of cabbage looper (Trichoplusia ni), eight neonate cabbage looper larvae were placed onto each of three plants per JA treatments (0, 100, 200, 400 µM) three days after treatment. After five days of feeding, weight of larvae and their survival rate was found to decrease with increasing JA concentrations in both broccoli cultivars. JA - inducible GSs were measured by high performance liquid chromatography. Neoglucobrassicin in Green Magic and glucobrassicin in VI-158 leaves were increased in a dose-dependent manner. One or both of these glucosinolates and/or their hydrolysis products showed significant inverse correlations with larval weight and survival (five days after treatment) while being positively correlated with the number of days to pupation. This implies that these two JA - inducible glucosinolates can influence the growth and survival of cabbage looper larvae. Transcriptome profiling supported the observed changes in glucosinolate and their hydrolysis product concentrations following JA treatments. Several genes related to GS metabolism differentiate the two broccoli cultivars in their pattern of transcriptional response to JA treatments. Indicative of the corresponding change in indole GS concentrations, transcripts of the transcription factor MYB122, core structure biosynthesis genes (CYP79B2, UGT74B1, SUR1, SOT16, SOT17, and SOT18), an indole glucosinolate side chain modification gene (IGMT1), and several glucosinolate hydrolysis genes (TGG1, TGG2, and ESM1) were significantly increased in Green Magic (statistically significant in most cases at 400 µM) while UGT74B1 and MYB122 were significantly increased in VI-158. Therefore, these metabolite and transcript biomarker results indicate that transcriptome profiling can identify genes associated with the formation of two different indole GS and their hydrolysis products. Therefore, these metabolite and transcript biomarkers could be useful in an effective marker - assisted breeding strategy for resistance to generalist lepidopteran pests in broccoli and potentially other Brassica vegetables.

27429935|t|The clinical prognosis of implants that are placed against super-erupted opposing dentition
27429935|a|If teeth are missing, super-eruption of teeth in the opposing arch can occur in the area and can change the occlusal plane. When missing teeth are replaced with implants, the oral surgeon must determine whether or not the super-erupted teeth need to be treated in order to normalize the occlusal plane. In this study, we evaluated the clinical prognosis of dentition after implant placement and prosthetic treatment were completed in an occlusal plane altered by super-erupted teeth in the opposing arch without additional treatment of the super-erupted teeth. Twenty-two patients (9 males, 13 females) were treated with implants and prosthetics without addressing the super-erupted opposing dentition from April 2004 to August 2012 at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital. A total of 33 implants were placed. Values of crestal bone loss, survival rates, and surgical and prosthetic complications for an average of 29.6 months after prosthetic loading were recorded. In one case, the cover screw was exposed after implant surgery. The mean crestal bone loss was 0.09±0.30 mm. Of the 33 implants, 31 survived, a survival rate of 93.94%. A prosthetic complication occurred in one case but functioned well after correction. Favorable clinical results from prosthetic complications, crestal bone loss, and implant survival rates were exhibited in implants next to a super-erupted opposing tooth.

27430662|t|Evaluation of Mathisen's technique for ureteral reimplantation in children with primary vesicoureteral reflux
27430662|a|Although cross-trigonal ureteral reimplantation (Cohen) is a commonly used technique in children, it represents a non-physiological transfer of the ureteral orifices and may prove challenging with regard to endoscopic ureteral operations in later life. In 1964, Mathisen described an alternative method of ureteral reimplantation with lateralization of the neohiatus, creating an orthotopic course of the submucosal ureter. We have evaluated success and complication rates of both techniques that were applied sequentially at our departments. Forty-eight consecutive patients (83 ureters, 24 males /24 females) following Mathisen reimplantation were compared with 53 consecutive patients (98 ureters, 30 males /23 females) following Cohen reimplantation. Inclusion criteria were primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and no previous intervention. Reflux grades (Mathisen 58 ureters /69.9% VUR ≥ III; Cohen 66 ureters /66.7% VUR ≥ III) and the occurence of other complicating factors (ureteroceles, megaureters, posterior urethral valves) in both groups were comparable. After Cohen's reimplantation there were no immediate complications requiring intervention; during follow-up (mean 28.2 months) three patients (5.6%) suffered febrile urinary tract infections (UTIs), of which one (1.8%) was diagnosed with a persisting VUR. Persistent hydronephroses (≥II SFU) were recorded in six patients (13.2%). After reimplantation using Mathisen's technique, two patients (4.1%) suffered significant intravesical bleeding; during follow-up (mean 23.06 months) four patients (8.3%) suffered febrile UTIs, and seven patients (14.5%) were diagnosed with persisting VUR after a mean follow-up of 10.8 months. The patients with persistent VUR had more commonly high-grade (IV and V) VUR initially, compared to the whole group. Two patients (4.1%) had persistent hydronephroses (≥II SFU). Mathisen's technique for ureteral reimplantation yielded a significantly (p = 0.0256 patients, p = 0.006 ureterorenal units) lower success rate (85.5% patients, 89.2% ureterorenal units) in comparison with Cohen's technique (98.2% patients, 99% ureterorenal units). Although there was no intervention for obstruction, persistent hydronephrosis was more common in the Cohen group (13.2% vs. 4.1%, n.s.). Despite the advantages of an orthotopic ureteral orifice close to the bladder neck, as achieved by Mathisen's reimplantation, cross-trigonal ureteral reimplantation proved more reliable for VUR correction. As regards optimizing the results, patient selection for either technique could prove essential. Nevertheless, as regards the difficulties with ectopic ureteral orifices in the Cohen technique in the long-term follow-up, the concept of anatomic, orthotopic ureteral reimplantation should be pursued and the technique should be further refined.

27432486|t|The use of neonatal extracorporeal life support in pediatric cardiac intensive care unit
27432486|a|The aim of the study is to evaluate extracorporeal life support system (ECLS) employed in neonates in pediatric cardiac intensive care unit. Twenty-five neonates that required ECLS in between November 2010 and November 2015 were evaluated. The median age was 12 days (range 3-28 days) and the median body weight was 3 kg (range 2.5-5 kg). Venoarterial ECLS was performed in all of the cases. Ascendan aorta - right atrial cannulation in 22 patients and neck cannulation in three patients were performed. The reason for ECLS was E-CPR in two patients, inability to wean from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in seven patients, respiratory insufficiency and hypoxia in nine patients, low cardiac output (LCOS) in seven patients. Median duration of ECLS was four days (range 1-15). Hemorrhagic complications developed in 15, renal complications in 13, pulmonary complications in 12, infectious complications in 11, neurologic complications in three and mechanical complications in two of the patients. Weaning was successful in 15 of the patients. Eleven patients were successfully discharged. ECLS is an important treatment option that is performed successfully in many centers around the world to maintain life support in patients unresponsive to medical treatment. The utilization of this modality especially in newborns with congenital heart disease should be taken into consideration.

27435204|t|Medicare claims indicators of healthcare utilization differences after hospitalization for ischemic stroke: Race, gender, and caregiving effects
27435204|a|Background Differences in healthcare utilization after stroke may partly explain race or gender differences in stroke outcomes and identify factors that might reduce post - acute stroke care costs. Aim To examine systematic differences in Medicare claims for healthcare utilization after hospitalization for ischemic stroke in a US population -based sample. Methods Claims were examined over a six-month period after hospitalization for 279 ischemic stroke survivors 65 years or older from the REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study. Statistical analyses examined differences in post - acute healthcare utilization, adjusted for pre - stroke utilization, as a function of race (African-American vs. White), gender, age, stroke belt residence, income, Medicaid dual-eligibility, Charlson comorbidity index, and whether the person lived with an available caregiver. Results After adjusting for covariates, women were more likely than men to receive home health care and to use emergency department services during the post - acute care period. These effects were maintained even after further adjustment for acute stroke severity. African-Americans had more home health care visits than Whites among patients who received some home health care. Having a co-residing caregiver was associated with reduced acute hospitalization length of stay and fewer post - acute emergency department and primary care physician visits. Conclusions Underutilization of healthcare after stroke does not appear to explain poorer long-term stroke outcomes for women and African-Americans in this epidemiologically -derived sample. Caregiver availability may contribute to reduced formal care and cost during the post - acute period.

27436068|t|Do dynamic global vegetation models capture the seasonality of carbon fluxes in the Amazon basin? A data - model intercomparison
27436068|a|To predict forest response to long-term climate change with high confidence requires that dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) be successfully tested against ecosystem response to short-term variations in environmental drivers, including regular seasonal patterns. Here, we used an integrated dataset from four forests in the Brasil flux network, spanning a range of dry-season intensities and lengths, to determine how well four state-of-the-art models (IBIS, ED2, JULES, and CLM3.5) simulated the seasonality of carbon exchanges in Amazonian tropical forests. We found that most DGVMs poorly represented the annual cycle of gross primary productivity (GPP), of photosynthetic capacity (Pc), and of other fluxes and pools. Models simulated consistent dry-season declines in GPP in the equatorial Amazon (Manaus K34, Santarem K67, and Caxiuanã CAX); a contrast to observed GPP increases. Model simulated dry-season GPP reductions were driven by an external environmental factor, ' soil water stress ' and consequently by a constant or decreasing photosynthetic infrastructure (Pc), while observed dry-season GPP resulted from a combination of internal biological (leaf -flush and abscission and increased Pc) and environmental (incoming radiation) causes. Moreover, we found models generally overestimated observed seasonal net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and respiration (Re) at equatorial locations. In contrast, a southern Amazon forest (Jarú RJA) exhibited dry-season declines in GPP and Re consistent with most DGVMs simulations. While water limitation was represented in models and the primary driver of seasonal photosynthesis in southern Amazonia, changes in internal biophysical processes, light-harvesting adaptations (e.g., variations in leaf area index (LAI) and increasing leaf -level assimilation rate related to leaf demography), and allocation lags between leaf and wood, dominated equatorial Amazon carbon flux dynamics and were deficient or absent from current model formulations. Correctly simulating flux seasonality at tropical forests requires a greater understanding and the incorporation of internal biophysical mechanisms in future model developments.

27436635|t|Blood Pressure and All-Cause Mortality by Level of Cognitive Function in the Elderly: Results From a Population-Based Study in Rural Greece
27436635|a|This study aimed to investigate whether the effect of blood pressure (BP) on mortality differs by levels of cognitive function. The associations of brachial systolic BP, diastolic BP, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and pulse pressure with all-cause mortality were prospectively explored (follow-up 7.0±2.2 years) in 660 community-dwelling individuals (≥60 years) using adjusted Cox models, stratified by cognitive impairment (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] <24). No association between brachial BP variables and mortality was shown for the total sample in quartiles analysis; however, MAP in the highest quartile, compared with the second, was associated with mortality (hazard ratio, 1.85; 95% confidence intervals, 1.09-3.12) among cognitively impaired individuals. The fractional-polynomials approach for BP confirmed this finding and further showed, solely in the MMSE <24 subcohort, U-shaped trends of MAP and systolic BP, with increased mortality risk in extremely low or high values; no such pattern was evident for patients with MMSE ≥24. Elderly individuals with cognitive impairment might be more susceptible to the detrimental effects of low and elevated MAP and systolic BP.

27437203|t|Hypovitaminosis D and Associated Cardiometabolic Risk in Women with PCOS
27437203|a|Women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) frequently suffer from metabolic disturbances like insulin resistance, hypertension and atherogenic dyslipidemia. Accumulating evidences suggest that Vitamin D deficiency is common in PCOS and may be associated with metabolic and endocrinal dysfunctions in PCOS. Thus women with PCOS may be at elevated risk of cardiovascular disease. Present study aims to evaluate Vitamin D status and to assess its association with metabolic and endocrinal dysregulations in women with PCOS, which might help in early identification and prevention of future symptomatic cardiac disease. A total of 44 women with PCOS, diagnosed by Rotterdam criteria and 45 healthy control without PCOS, were evaluated for Vitamin D and cardiometabolic risk factors, including fasting plasma glucose, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hs-CRP. That apart, several endocrinal parameters of hyperandrogenism were also examined. Several correlation studies were determined to establish the role of Vitamin D as a cardiometabolic risk factor in PCOS. Results were expressed as mean±SD and were statistically analysed using SPSS software version 16, unpaired student's t-test and Pearson's correlation coefficient. We found lower levels of Vitamin D, which was statistically significant as compared to healthy controls. Hyperinsulinemia, rise in insulin resistance and marked dyslipidemia was observed in the present study. Another relevant finding was significant correlation of Vitamin D with insulin and Homeostatic Model of Assessment- Insulin Resistance Index (HOMA-IR). Hypovitaminosis D was prevalent in PCOS. This was related to metabolic and hormonal disorders in PCOS. Possibly this combined with impaired fasting glucose, IR and dyslipidemia, could account for Cardio vascular risks in PCOS. Further prospective observational studies and randomized control trials are required to explore the above hypothesis.

27438380|t|Family close but friends closer: exploring social support and resilience in older spousal dementia carers
27438380|a|Spousal dementia carers have unique support needs; they are likely to disengage from their existing social networks as they need to devote more time to caring as the disease progresses. Previously we showed that support resources can facilitate resilience in carers, but the relationship is complex and varies by relationship type. The current paper aims to explore social support as a key component of resilience to identify the availability, function and perceived functional aspects of support provided to older spousal dementia carers. We conducted 23 in-depth qualitative interviews with spousal carers from two carer support groups and a care home in North West England. Family and friends served a wide range of functions but were equally available to resilient and non-resilient participants. Family support was perceived as unhelpful if it created feelings of over-dependence. Participants were less likely to resist involvement of grandchildren due to their relatively narrow and low-level support functions. Friend support was perceived as most helpful when it derived from those in similar circumstances. Neighbours played a functionally unique role of crisis management. These perceptions may moderate the effect of support on resilience. Family and friend support is not always sufficient to facilitate resilience. Support functions facilitate resilience only if they are perceived to match need. Implications of these findings are discussed.

27440782|t|Measure Up Pressure Down: Provider Toolkit to Improve Hypertension Control
27440782|a|Hypertension is one of the most important risk factors for heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, and diabetes complications. Nearly one in three Americans adults has high blood pressure, and the cost associated with treating this condition is staggering. The Measure Up Pressure Down: Provider Toolkit to Improve Hypertension Control is a resource developed by the American Medical Group Foundation in partnership with the American Medical Group Association. The goal of this toolkit is to mobilize health care practitioners to work together through team -based approaches to achieve an 80% control rate of high blood pressure among their patient population. The toolkit can be used by health educators, clinic administrators, physicians, students, and other clinic staff as a step-by-step resource for developing the infrastructure needed to better identify and treat individuals with high blood pressure or other chronic conditions.

27441638|t|Potentiation of LPS - Induced Apoptotic Cell Death in Human Hepatoma HepG2 Cells by Aspirin via ROS and Mitochondrial Dysfunction: Protection by N-Acetyl Cysteine
27441638|a|Cytotoxicity and inflammation - associated toxic responses have been observed to be induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in vitro and in vivo respectively. Use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin, has been reported to be beneficial in inflammation - associated diseases like cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular disorders. Their precise molecular mechanisms, however, are not clearly understood. Our previous studies on aspirin treated HepG2 cells strongly suggest cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. In the present study, we have further demonstrated that HepG2 cells treated with LPS alone or in combination with aspirin induces subcellular toxic responses which are accompanied by increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, oxidative stress, mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction and apoptosis. The LPS / Aspirin induced toxicity was attenuated by pre-treatment of cells with N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). Alterations in oxidative stress and glutathione - dependent redox-homeostasis were more pronounced in mitochondria compared to extra - mitochondrial cellular compartments. Pre-treatment of HepG2 cells with NAC exhibited a selective protection in redox homeostasis and mitochondrial dysfunction. Our results suggest that the altered redox metabolism, oxidative stress and mitochondrial function in HepG2 cells play a critical role in LPS / aspirin - induced cytotoxicity. These results may help in better understanding the pharmacological, toxicological and therapeutic properties of NSAIDs in cancer cells exposed to bacterial endotoxins.

27442784|t|Placental Pathologic Associations with Morbidly Adherent Placenta: Potential insights into Pathogenesis
27442784|a|The pathology that underlies morbidly adherent placenta (MAP) is poorly understood. The objective of this study was to describe the placental pathology, especially implantation site pathology, associated with MAP. This was a single institution, retrospective case-control study design examining placentas of patients who delivered between January 2008 and September 2013. MAP cases were defined by the need for clinical intervention at delivery beyond spontaneous placental delivery or simple manual extraction of the placenta. Controls consisted of patients with placentas sent for examination due to a history of maternal malignancy with no clinical suspicion of accreta. Placental pathologic findings of maternal vascular underperfusion (MVU), acute inflammation, chronic inflammation, fetal vascular obstruction and hemorrhage were recorded and compared using bivariable and multivariable analyses. Three categories of pathologic changes were seen more commonly in MAP placentas (N=101) than control placentas (N=110): chronic basal inflammation, villous changes of MVU and retromembranous and retromembranous / intervillous hemorrhage. In multivariable analyses adjusted for confounders, chronic basal villitis (aOR 5.6, 1.73-18.18), plasma cell deciduitis (aOR 2.63, 1.08-6.39), increased syncytial knots (aOR 3.92, 1.57-9.75), villous agglutination (aOR 24.85, 2.78-221.75), increased perivillous fibrin (aOR 5.08, 1.49-17.34), and the presence of subchorionic / intervillous thrombi (aOR 4.01, 1.63-9.86) remained associated with MAP. MAP is highly associated with evidence of intraparenchymal placental hemorrhage villous changes of MVU, and a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate at the implantation site. The contribution of this basal chronic inflammatory infiltrate to MAP requires further investigation.

27445856|t|High-Intensity Intermittent Training Positively Affects Aerobic and Anaerobic Performance in Judo Athletes Independently of Exercise Mode
27445856|a|The present study investigated the effects of high-intensity intermittent training (HIIT) on lower - and upper-body graded exercise and high-intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE, four Wingate bouts) performance, and on physiological and muscle damage markers responses in judo athletes. Thirty-five subjects were randomly allocated to a control group (n = 8) or to one of the following HIIT groups (n = 9 for each) and tested pre- and post -four weeks (2 training d·wk(-1)): (1) lower-body cycle-ergometer; (2) upper-body cycle-ergometer; (3) uchi-komi (judo technique entrance). All HIIT were constituted by two blocks of 10 sets of 20 s of all out effort interspersed by 10 s set intervals and 5-min between blocks. For the upper-body group there was an increase in maximal aerobic power in graded upper-body exercise test (12.3%). The lower-body group increased power at onset blood lactate in graded upper-body exercise test (22.1%). The uchi-komi group increased peak power in upper - (16.7%) and lower-body (8.5%), while the lower-body group increased lower-body mean power (14.2%) during the HIIE. There was a decrease in the delta blood lactate for the uchi-komi training group and in the third and fourth bouts for the upper-body training group. Training induced testosterone-cortisol ratio increased in the lower-body HIIE for the lower-body (14.9%) and uchi-komi (61.4%) training groups. Thus, short-duration low-volume HIIT added to regular judo training was able to increase upper-body aerobic power, lower - and upper-body HIIE performance.

27445997|t|Microbiomes of Muricea californica and M. fruticosa: Comparative Analyses of Two Co-occurring Eastern Pacific Octocorals
27445997|a|Octocorals are sources of novel but understudied microbial diversity. Conversely, scleractinian or reef-building coral microbiomes have been heavily examined in light of the threats of climate change. Muricea californica and Muricea fruticosa are two co-occurring species of gorgonian octocoral abundantly found in the kelp forests of southern California, and thus provide an excellent basis to determine if octocoral microbiomes are host specific. Using Illumina MiSeq amplicon sequencing and replicate samples, we evaluated the microbiomes collected from multiple colonies of both species of Muricea to measure both inter- and intra-colony microbiome variabilities. In addition, microbiomes from overlying sea water and nearby zoanthids (another benthic invertebrate) were also included in the analysis to evaluate whether bacterial taxa specifically associate with octocorals. This is also the first report of microbiomes from these species of Muricea. We show that microbiomes isolated from each sample type are distinct, and specifically, that octocoral species type had the greatest effect on predicting the composition of the Muricea microbiome. Bacterial taxa contributing to compositional differences include distinct strains of Mycoplasma associated with either M. californica or M. fruticosa, an abundance of Spirochaetes observed on M. californica, and a greater diversity of γ-Proteobacteria associated with M. fruticosa. Many of the bacterial taxa contributing to these differences are known for their presence in photosymbiont-containing invertebrate microbiomes.

27447713|t|2,8-Dihydroxyadenine Nephropathy Identified as Cause of End-Stage Renal Disease After Renal Transplant
27447713|a|Adenine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of uric acid metabolism that leads to formation and excretion of 2,8-dihydroxyadenine into urine. The low solubility of 2,8-dihydroxyadenine results in precipitation and formation of urinary crystals and renal stones. Patients with this disorder usually have recurrent nephrolithiasis and can develop nephropathy secondary to crystal precipitation in the renal parenchyma. The disease is most often underdiagnosed and can recur in renal transplant, causing graft failure. Lack of specific clinical manifestations, chemical and radiologic features identical to those shown with uric acid stones, and lack of awareness among clinicians are among the causes for the underdiagnoses of this treatable disease. Allopurinol, a xanthine dehydrogenase inhibitor, is the mainstay of treatment, supported by high fluid intake and dietary modifications. The possibility of adenine phosphoribosyl transferase deficiency should be considered in all cases of urolithiasis in children, patients with recurrent urolithiasis, and patients with urolithiasis associated with renal failure of unknown cause, including patients with end-stage renal disease and renal transplant recipients. Here, we report a case of a 41-year-old female patient who had a late diagnosis of 2,8-dihydroxyadenine nephropathy -induced end-stage renal disease, made on the native nephrectomy that accompanied the renal transplant, and who had a timely intervention that prevented recurrence in the graft.

27449022|t|Social capital and healthy ageing in Indonesia
27449022|a|A large international literature has found a positive association between social capital and measures of physical and mental health. However, there is a paucity of research on the links between social capital and healthy ageing in a developing country environment, where universal social security coverage is absent and health infrastructure is poor. In this paper, we develop and empirically test a model of the linkages between social capital and the health outcomes for older adults in Indonesia, using data from the Indonesian Family Life Survey-East (IFLS-East), conducted in 2012. Using multivariate regression analysis, we examine whether social capital plays a role in mitigating poor health among older individuals aged 50 years and above in Indonesia 's most vulnerable provinces. We test the robustness of these social capital variables across different health measures (self-assessed health, Activities of Daily Living (ADL), measures of chronic illness and mental health measures), as well as across different demographic groups, after controlling for an array of socio-economic, demographic and geographic characteristics. Our findings show that access to better social capital (using measures of neighbourhood trust and community participation) is associated with a higher degree of physical mobility, independence, and mental well-being among older individuals but has no influence on chronic illnesses. These results are consistent when we estimate samples disaggregated by gender, rural / urban residence, and by age categories. From a policy perspective these results point to the importance of social capital measures in moderating the influence of poor health, particularly in the Activities of Daily Living.

27449508|t|Modulation of Interleukins in Sepsis - Associated Clotting Disorders: Interplay With Hemostatic Derangement
27449508|a|Interleukins play a central role in the immune system and are involved in a variety of immunological, inflammatory, and infectious disease states including sepsis syndrome. Levels of interleukins may correlate with overall survival and may directly or indirectly affect some of the regulators of coagulation and fibrinolysis, thereby disrupting hemostasis and thrombosis. Our hypothesis is that in sepsis-associated coagulopathies (SACs), interleukins may be upregulated, leading to hemostatic imbalance by generating thrombogenic mediators. We profiled the levels of interleukins IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 in addition to d-dimer (DD) in patients with SAC and in normal donors. We observed the highest increase in interleukins IL-6 (322-fold), IL-8 (48-fold), IL-10 (72-fold), and DD (18-fold). This suggests that interleukins such as IL-6 and IL-10 have a close association with coagulopathy and fibrinolytic dysregulation in sepsis and can be considered as candidates for potential therapeutic targets in SAC.

27450737|t|Thymosin β4: Roles in Development, Repair, and Engineering of the Cardiovascular System
27450737|a|The burden of cardiovascular disease is a growing worldwide issue that demands attention. While many clinical trials are ongoing to test therapies for treating the heart after myocardial infarction (MI) and heart failure, there are few options doctors able to currently give patients to repair the heart. This eventually leads to decreased ventricular contractility and increased systemic disease, including vascular disorders that could result in stroke. Small peptides such as thymosin β4 (Tβ4) are upregulated in the cardiovascular niche during fetal development and after injuries such as MI, providing increased neovasculogenesis and paracrine signals for endogenous stem cell recruitment to aid in wound repair. New research is looking into the effects of in vivo administration of Tβ4 through injections and coatings on implants, as well as its effect on cell differentiation. Results so far demonstrate Tβ4 administration leads to robust increases in angiogenesis and wound healing in the heart after MI and the brain after stroke, and can differentiate adult stem cells toward the cardiac lineage for implantation to the heart to increase contractility and survival. Future work, some of which is currently in clinical trials, will demonstrate the in vivo effect of these therapies on human patients, with the goal of helping the millions of people worldwide affected by cardiovascular disease.

27451448|t|Yersinia ruckeri Isolates Recovered from Diseased Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar) in Scotland Are More Diverse than Those from Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and Represent Distinct Subpopulations
27451448|a|Yersinia ruckeri is the etiological agent of enteric redmouth (ERM) disease of farmed salmonids. Enteric redmouth disease is traditionally associated with rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss, Walbaum), but its incidence in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is increasing. Yersinia ruckeri isolates recovered from diseased Atlantic salmon have been poorly characterized, and very little is known about the relationship of the isolates associated with these two species. Phenotypic approaches were used to characterize 109 Y. ruckeri isolates recovered over a 14-year period from infected Atlantic salmon in Scotland; 26 isolates from infected rainbow trout were also characterized. Biotyping, serotyping, and comparison of outer membrane protein profiles identified 19 Y. ruckeri clones associated with Atlantic salmon but only five associated with rainbow trout; none of the Atlantic salmon clones occurred in rainbow trout and vice versa These findings suggest that distinct subpopulations of Y. ruckeri are associated with each species. A new O serotype (designated O8) was identified in 56 biotype 1 Atlantic salmon isolates and was the most common serotype identified from 2006 to 2011 and in 2014, suggesting an increased prevalence during the time period sampled. Rainbow trout isolates were represented almost exclusively by the same biotype 2, serotype O1 clone that has been responsible for the majority of ERM outbreaks in this species within the United Kingdom since the 1980s. However, the identification of two biotype 2, serotype O8 isolates in rainbow trout suggests that vaccines containing serotypes O1 and O8 should be evaluated in both rainbow trout and Atlantic salmon for application in Scotland. Vaccination plays an important role in protecting Atlantic salmon against the bacterial pathogen Yersinia ruckeri, but, in recent years, there has been an increasing incidence of vaccine breakdown in salmon. This is largely because current vaccines are aimed at rainbow trout and are based on serotypes specific for this species. A wider range of serotypes is responsible for infection in Atlantic salmon, but very little is known about the diversity of these strains and their relationships to those recovered from rainbow trout. In the present study, we demonstrate that Y. ruckeri isolates recovered from diseased Atlantic salmon in Scotland are more diverse than those from rainbow trout; furthermore, isolates from the two species represent distinct subpopulations. In addition, a new O serotype was identified that is responsible for a significant proportion of the disease in Atlantic salmon. Our findings are likely to have important implications for the development of improved vaccines against Y. ruckeri.

27452524|t|CD84 mediates CLL - microenvironment interactions
27452524|a|Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a malignant disease of small mature lymphocytes. Signals from the CLL microenvironment promote progression of the disease and induce drug resistance. This phenomenon is largely dependent on direct contact between the malignant B cells and stromal cells. CD84 belongs to the signaling lymphocyte activation molecule family of immunoreceptors, which self-associates, forming an orthogonal homophilic dimer. We therefore hypothesized that CD84 may bridge between CLL cells and their microenvironment, promoting cell survival. Our in vitro results show that CD84 expressed on CLL cells interact with CD84 expressed on cells in their microenvironment, inducing cell survival in both sides. Blocking CD84 in vitro and in vivo disrupt the interaction of CLL cells with their microenvironment, resulting in induced cell death. Thus, our findings suggest novel therapeutic strategies based on the blockade of this CD84 - dependent survival pathway.

27453213|t|Aurantimonas endophytica sp. nov., a novel endophytic bacterium isolated from roots of Anabasis elatior (C. A. Mey.) Schischk
27453213|a|An orange-coloured, aerobic, motile and short-rods bacterial strain, designated EGI 6500337T, was isolated from the surface-sterilized root of a halophyte Anabasis elatior (C. A. Mey.) Schischk collected from Urumqi, Xinjiang province, north-west China. Growth occurred at 5-35 °C (optimum 30 °C), at pH 6.0-9.0 (optimum pH 7.0), and in the presence of 0-6 % NaCl (w/v) (optimum 0-1 %). Phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain EGI 6500337T formed a distinct lineage in the cluster that comprised the genera Aurantimonas and Aureimonas in the family Aurantimonadaceae. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain EGI 6500337T shared the highest similarities to those of Aurantimonas coralicida DSM 14790T (97.15 %) and Aurantimonas manganoxydans DSM 21871T (97.15 %). Strain EGI 6500337T contained Q-10 as the dominant isoprenoid quinone. The major cellular fatty acids were C18:1 7c (66.4 %) and C19:0 8c cyclo (23.3 %). The polar lipid profile of strain EGI 6500337T contained diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine as major components, similarly to the members of the genus Aurantimonas. The DNA G+C content of strain EGI 6500337T was 66.8 mol%. The DNA - DNA relatedness between strain EGI 6500337T and Aurantimonas coralicida DSM 14790T was 24.7 ± 2.9 %. On the basis of the phylogenetic analysis, chemotaxonomic data and phenotypic characteristics, strain EGI 6500337T represents a novel species of the genus Aurantimonas, for which the name Aurantimonas endophytica sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is EGI 6500337T (= KCTC 52296T = CPCC 100904T).

27453830|t|Assessment and classification of protocol deviations
27453830|a|Deviations from the approved trial protocol are common during clinical trials. They have been conventionally classified as deviations or violations, depending on their impact on the trial. A new method has been proposed by which deviations are classified in five grades from 1 to 5. A deviation of Grade 1 has no impact on the subjects' well-being or on the quality of data. At the maximum, a deviation Grade 5 leads to the death of the subject. This method of classification was applied to deviations noted in the center over the last 3 years. It was observed that most deviations were of Grades 1 and 2, with fewer falling in Grades 3 and 4. There were no deviations that led to the death of the subject (Grade 5). This method of classification would help trial managers decide on the action to be taken on the occurrence of deviations, which would be based on their impact.

27454401|t|Fabrication and modelling of fractal, biomimetic, micro and nano-topographical surfaces
27454401|a|Natural surface topographies are often self-similar with hierarchical features at the micro and nanoscale, which may be mimicked to overcome modern tissue engineering and biomaterial design limitations. Specifically, a cell's microenvironment within the human body contains highly optimised, fractal topographical cues, which directs precise cell behaviour. However, recreating biomimetic, fractal topographies in vitro is not a trivial process and a number of fabrication methods have been proposed but often fail to precisely control the spatial resolution of features at different lengths scales and hence, to provide true biomimetic properties. Here, we propose a method of accurately reproducing the self-similar, micro and nanoscale topography of a human biological tissue into a synthetic polymer through an innovative fabrication process. The biological tissue surface was characterised using atomic force microscopy (AFM) to obtain spatial data in X, Y and Z, which was converted into a grayscale 'digital photomask'. As a result of maskless grayscale optical lithography followed by modified deep reactive ion etching and replica molding, we were able to accurately reproduce the fractal topography of acellular dermal matrix (ADM) into polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Characterisation using AFM at three different length scales revealed that the nano and micro-topographical features, in addition to the fractal dimension, of native ADM were reproduced in PDMS. In conclusion, it has been shown that the fractal topography of biological surfaces can be mimicked in synthetic materials using the novel fabrication process outlined, which may be applied to significantly enhance medical device biocompatibility and performance.

27457339|t|Investigating Effects of Acidic pH on Proliferation, Invasion and Drug - Induced Apoptosis in Lymphoblastic Leukemia
27457339|a|Some studies have shown that extracellular pH in tumors, which results in tumor progression, is less than that in normal tissues. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of extracellular acidic pH on proliferation, invasion, and drug - induced apoptosis in acute lymphoblastic cells. The cells were cultured in different pH (pH 6.6 and pH 7.4) for 12 days. Cell proliferation was assessed by MTT assay and cell invasion was assayed by invasion assay and gene expression analysis of MMP-9. Drug - induced apoptosis was evaluated after exposure to doxorubicin for 24 hours by annexin V / PI staining and gene expression analysis of BAX pro-apoptotic protein. The results indicated the enhanced growth and invasion of leukemic cells at pH 6.6 (P ≤ 0.05). Furthermore, the cells at pH 6.6 were resistant to apoptosis by doxorubicin (P ≤ 0.05). It can be concluded that acidic pH increases the proliferation, invasion and reduces the drug - induced apoptosis in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Extracellular acidity can influence the behavior of leukemic cells and therefore, the manipulation of extracellular liquid can be selected as a therapeutic strategy for leukemia, especially for acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

27462099|t|Hemodynamic correlates of transient cognitive impairment after transient ischemic attack and minor stroke: A transcranial Doppler study
27462099|a|Transient cognitive impairment (TCI) on the Mini Mental State Evaluation score is common after transient ischemic attack / minor stroke and might identify patients at increased risk of dementia. We aimed to replicate TCI using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), compare it with persistent Mild Cognitive Impairment (PMCI), and to determine whether global cerebral hemodynamic changes could explain transient impairment. Consecutive patients with transient ischemic attack / minor stroke (NIHSS ≤ 3) were assessed with the MoCA and transcranial Doppler ultrasound acutely and at 1 month. We compared patients with TCI (baseline MoCA < 26 with ≥ 2 points increase at 1 month), PMCI (MoCA < 26 with < 2 points increase), and no cognitive impairment (NCI; MoCA ≥ 26). Of 326 patients, 46 (14.1%) had PMCI, 98 (30.1%) TCI, and 182 (55.8%) NCI. At baseline, TCI patients had higher systolic blood pressure (150.95 ± 21.52 vs 144.86 ± 22.44 mmHg, p = 0.02) and lower cerebral blood flow velocities, particularly end-diastolic velocity (30.16 ± 9.63 vs 35.02 ± 9.01 cm/s, p < 0.001) and mean flow velocity (48.95 ± 12.72 vs 54 ± 12.46 cm/s, p = 0.001) than those with NCI, but similar clinical and hemodynamic profiles to those with PMCI. Systolic BP fell between baseline and 1 month (mean reduction = 14.01 ± 21.26 mmHg) and end-diastolic velocity and mean flow velocity increased (mean increase = + 2.42 ± 6.41 and 1.89 ± 8.77 cm/s, respectively), but these changes did not differ between patients with TCI, PMCI, and NCI. TCI is detectable with the MoCA after transient ischemic attack and minor stroke and has similar clinical and hemodynamic profile to PMCI. However, TCI does not appear to be due to exaggerated acute reversible global hemodynamic changes.

27463942|t|Apixaban 5 mg Twice Daily and Clinical Outcomes in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation and Advanced Age, Low Body Weight, or High Creatinine: A Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Clinical Trial
27463942|a|In the Apixaban for Reduction of Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Complications in Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) trial, the standard dose of apixaban was 5 mg twice daily; patients with at least 2 dose - reduction criteria-80 years or older, weight 60 kg or less, and creatinine level 1.5 mg/dL or higher-received a reduced dose of apixaban of 2.5 mg twice daily. Little is known about patients with 1 dose - reduction criterion who received the 5 mg twice daily dose of apixaban. To determine the frequency of 1 dose - reduction criterion and whether the effects of the 5 mg twice daily dose of apixaban on stroke or systemic embolism and bleeding varied among patients with 1 or no dose - reduction criteria. Among 18 201 patients in the ARISTOTLE trial, 17 322 were included in this analysis. Annualized event rates of stroke or systemic embolism and major bleeding and hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were evaluated. Interactions between the effects of apixaban vs warfarin and the presence of 1 or no dose - reduction criteria were assessed. The first patient was enrolled in the ARISTOTLE trial on December 19, 2006, and follow-up was completed on January 30, 2011. Data were analyzed from January 2015 to May 30, 2016. Analysis of major bleeding included events during study drug treatment. Analysis of stroke or systemic embolism was based on intention to treat. Of the patients with 1 or no dose - reduction criteria assigned to receive the 5 mg twice daily dose of apixaban or warfarin, 3966 had 1 dose - reduction criterion; these patients had higher rates of stroke or systemic embolism (HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.20-1.81) and major bleeding (HR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.62-2.20) compared with those with no dose - reduction criteria (n = 13 356). The benefit of the 5 mg twice daily dose of apixaban (n = 8665) compared with warfarin (n = 8657) on stroke or systemic embolism in patients with 1 dose - reduction criterion (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.66-1.32) and no dose - reduction criterion (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.62-0.97) were similar (P for interaction = .36). Similarly, the benefit of 5 mg twice daily dose of apixaban compared with warfarin on major bleeding in patients with 1 dose - reduction criterion (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.53-0.87) and no dose - reduction criterion (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.60-0.86) were similar (P for interaction = .71). Similar patterns were seen for each dose - reduction criterion and across the spectrum of age, body weight, creatinine level, and creatinine clearance. Patients with atrial fibrillation and isolated advanced age, low body weight, or renal dysfunction have a higher risk of stroke or systemic embolism and major bleeding but show consistent benefits with the 5 mg twice daily dose of apixaban vs warfarin compared with patients without these characteristics. The 5 mg twice daily dose of apixaban is safe, efficacious, and appropriate for patients with only 1 dose - reduction criterion. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00412984.

27465464|t|Transition From Hospital to Home in Preterm Infants and Their Families
27465464|a|When the day of discharge from a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) comes for the parents of newborn infants, they are filled with long-awaited joy and happiness. They go home feeling as parents, away from scheduled routines of the hospital, monitor alarms, clinical rounds, numerous tests, and so on. What do we know about what happens after these little patients and their families leave the NICU? What happens from the point of leaving the hospital until when things get settled and life becomes perceived as normal? This article presents a short summary of research conducted with the vulnerable population of high-risk and preterm infants and their families postdischarge. Available evidence suggests that transition to home after hospital discharge, a phenomenon that many families experience, is challenging and requires attention from clinicians and researchers if we are to provide effective, efficient, and high-quality care.

27466053|t|Visual Analytics for Pattern Discovery in Home Care. Clinical Relevance for Quality Improvement
27466053|a|Visualization can reduce the cognitive load of information, allowing users to easily interpret and assess large amounts of data. The purpose of our study was to examine home health data using visual analysis techniques to discover clinically salient associations between patient characteristics with problem-oriented health outcomes of older adult home health patients during the home health service period. Knowledge, Behavior and Status ratings at discharge as well as change from admission to discharge that was coded using the Omaha System was collected from a dataset on 988 de-identified patient data from 15 home health agencies. SPSS Visualization Designer v1.0 was used to visually analyze patterns between independent and outcome variables using heat maps and histograms. Visualizations suggesting clinical salience were tested for significance using correlation analysis. The mean age of the patients was 80 years, with the majority female (66%). Of the 150 visualizations, 69 potentially meaningful patterns were statistically evaluated through bivariate associations, revealing 21 significant associations. Further, 14 associations between episode length and Charlson co-morbidity index mainly with urinary related diagnoses and problems remained significant after adjustment analyses. Through visual analysis, the adverse association of the longer home health episode length and higher Charlson co-morbidity index with behavior or status outcomes for patients with impaired urinary function was revealed. We have demonstrated the use of visual analysis to discover novel patterns that described high-needs subgroups among the older home health patient population. The effective presentation of these data patterns can allow clinicians to identify areas of patient improvement, and time periods that are most effective for implementing home health interventions to improve patient outcomes.

27466300|t|Transforming Growth Factor Beta 1 (TGF-β1) in Thyroid Cancer Patients: a View from the Peripheral Blood
27466300|a|Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) plays an important role in many pathophysiological conditions, including cancer. The level of TGF-β in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) has not been examined so far. The aim of this study was to measure TGF-β concentration in serum samples and in PHA - stimulated whole blood culture in vitro and to analyze possible associations of TGF-β1 levels with leukocyte, lymphocyte and platelets counts, the histological type of thyroid cancer, and stage of disease. TGF-β1 was measured in 22 DTC patients and 20 healthy controls using the duoSet ELISA Development kit for human TGF-β1. The concentration of TGF-β1 in serum samples from both groups correlated positively with the platelet counts. There was no statistically significant difference in the serum concentrations of TGF-β1 between DTC patients and control subjects, but PHA stimulated whole blood cultures of DTC patients produced less TGF-β1 than those from controls. Additional studies are needed to determine the significance of these in vitro findings.

27466374|t|P-glycoprotein traffics from the nucleus to the plasma membrane in rat brain endothelium during inflammatory pain
27466374|a|P-glycoprotein (PgP), a drug efflux pump in blood-brain barrier endothelial cells, is a major clinical obstacle for effective central nervous system drug delivery. Identifying PgP regulatory pathways that can be exploited clinically is critical for improving central nervous system drug delivery. We previously found that PgP activity increases in rat brain microvessels concomitant with decreased central nervous system drug delivery in response to acute peripheral inflammatory pain. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that PgP traffics to the luminal plasma membrane of the microvessel endothelial cells from intracellular stores during peripheral inflammatory pain. Using immunofluorescence microscopy, we detected PgP in endothelial cell nuclei and in the luminal plasma membrane in control animals. Following peripheral inflammatory pain, luminal PgP staining increased while staining in the nucleus decreased. Biochemical analysis of nuclear PgP content confirmed our visual observations. Peripheral inflammatory pain also increased endothelial cell luminal staining of polymerase 1 and transcript release factor / cavin1 and serum deprivation response protein / cavin2, two caveolar scaffold proteins, without changing caveolin1 or protein kinase C delta binding protein / cavin3 location. Our data (a) indicate that PgP traffics from stores in the nucleus to the endothelial cell luminal membrane in response to peripheral inflammatory pain; (b) provide an explanation for our previous observation that peripheral inflammatory pain inhibits central nervous system drug uptake; and (c) suggest a novel regulatory mechanism for PgP activity in rat brain.

27469396|t|Functional Impairment in Children With Externalizing Behavior Disorders: Psychometric Properties of the Weiss Functional Impairment Rating Scale-Parent Report in a German Clinical Sample
27469396|a|To examine the psychometric properties of a German adaptation of the Weiss Functional Impairment Rating Scale-Parent Report (WFIRS-P) in a clinical sample of children (4-12 years) with externalizing behavior disorders. Data were collected within two clinical trials (N = 264). Factorial validity, reliability, and divergent validity from symptoms of ADHD and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) were assessed. Confirmatory factor analyses revealed that a bifactor model consistent with the theoretical assumption of a general construct of impairment (total scale) and additional specific factors (subscales) provided satisfactory data fit. Model -based reliability estimates showed that both the general construct and specific factors accounted for item variance. Internal consistencies were >.70, part-whole corrected item-scale correlations mostly >.30. Correlations between the WFIRS-P Scales and ADHD and ODD symptoms were low to moderate. The results support the factorial validity, reliability, and divergent validity of the WFIRS-P.

27469581|t|What can the Canadians and Americans learn from each other's health care systems?
27469581|a|Numerous papers have been written comparing the Canadian and US healthcare systems, and a number of health policy experts have recommended that the Americans implement their single-payer system to save 12-20% of its healthcare expenditures. This paper is different in that it assumes that neither country will undertake a significant philosophic or structural change in their healthcare system, but there are lessons to be learned that are inherent in one that could be a major breakthrough for the other. Following the model in Canada and in Western Europe, the USA could implement universal health insurance so that the 32.0 million (2015) Americans still uninsured would have at least minimal coverage when incurring medical expenditures. Also, the USA could use smart cards to evaluate eligibility and to process health insurance claims; these changes resulting in an estimated 15% reduction in US health expenditures without adversely effecting access or quality of care. Such a strategy would result in the eventual loss of 2.5 million white-collar jobs at hospitals, physician offices and insurance companies, a long-term economic gain. Only a few would agree with the statement that Canada already functions with a multi-payer reimbursement system as evidenced by (1) a federal - provincial, tax - supported plan, administered by each of the provinces, providing universal coverage for hospital and physician services and (2) roughly 60% of its residents receiving employer-paid health insurance benefits, underwritten primarily by investor-owned plans, that are less than effective to reimburse for pharmaceuticals, dental and other healthcare services. What could be learned from the USA and particularly from Western European countries is possibly implementing an approach, whereby at least upper-income Canadians could opt out of their federal - provincial plan and purchase private insurance coverage - being eligible for far more comprehensive "private" benefits for hospital, physician, pharmaceutical, dental and other healthcare services. Aside from generating billions of additional needed revenues from the private sector, it could (1) help eliminate long waits for non-emergent physicians' care by appointing newly minted specialists to their medical staffs; (2) offer prompt admissions for elective cases to " private " wings of hospitals; (3) increase available funding for what is currently an undercapitalized system; (4) enhance the system's sluggish operations; and (5) encourage more competition among various providers. Although such a two-tier approach, such as available in the USA and elsewhere, is politically dead on arrival in Canada today, private insurance being already legal and commonly available there. Interestingly, this recommended solution is utilized in most western European countries where there is a higher percentagea than in Canada of public (versus private) funding of their total health expenditures. Because of various vested interests, attempts to implement any of the aforementioned proposals will undoubtedly result in considerable political rancor. There is greater likelihood, however, that the Canadians because their need to be more effective and efficient in their delivery of care, and their overall long-term fiscal outlook will agree to the further privatization of their healthcare system before the Americans will mandate universal access, use the smart card to process insurance eligibility and claims or will impose price controls on high-tech services and on pharmaceuticals.

27471363|t|Optimal Duration of Coronary Ligation and Reperfusion for Reperfusion Injury Study in a Rat Model
27471363|a|Reperfusion injury (RI) has an important impact on the clinical prognosis for patients with acute myocardial injury who had their coronary blood flow reestablished. However, no studies to date have investigated the timeframe of coronary occlusion and reperfusion effects on RI. A total of 100 rats were divided into 4 groups based on the coronary ligation period: 30, 60, 120, and 180 min, and each group was further divided into 5 subgroups with different reperfusion periods: 0, 30, 60, 120, and 180 min. R0 was the baseline of each subgroup. All animals received the same protocols for designed ligation and reperfusion periods. Evans blue and 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride were used to distinguish different myocardial injury areas: area at risk (AAR) and myocardial necrosis. The differences of the ratios of the necrotic area to AAR between each subgroup and baseline were further averaged to calculate an overall value of each heart. The relative RI percentages showed significant differences (0.8 ± 2.3%, 4.9 ± 3.3%, 10.8 ± 3.1%, and 20.3 ± 3.6% respectively, p < 0.001) at different time points of reperfusion but not at different time points of ligation (p = 0.593). The effects of different time courses in RI showed that the L120R180 group (43.4 ± 2.3%) had the highest RI difference with the baseline group. Maximal RI occurred at the timeframe of L120R180 in our animal model. This result may be utilized to assess the substantial benefits of RI therapies in an experimental rat model setting.

27473209|t|Derivation of a Predictive Score for Hemorrhagic Progression of Cerebral Contusions in Moderate and Severe Traumatic Brain Injury
27473209|a|After traumatic brain injury (TBI), hemorrhagic progression of contusions (HPCs) occurs frequently. However, there is no established predictive score to identify high-risk patients for HPC. Consecutive patients who were hospitalized (2008-2013) with non-penetrating moderate or severe TBI were studied. The primary outcome was HPC, defined by both a relative increase in contusion volume by ≥30 % and an absolute increase by ≥10 mL on serial imaging. Logistic regression models were created to identify independent risk factors for HPC. The HPC Score was then derived based on the final model. Among a total of 286 eligible patients, 61 (21 %) patients developed HPC. On univariate analyses, HPC was associated with older age, higher initial blood pressure, antiplatelet medications, anticoagulants, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) subdural hematoma (SDH), skull fracture, frontal contusion, larger contusion volume, and shorter interval from injury to initial CT. In the final model, SAH (OR 6.33, 95 % CI, 1.80-22.23), SDH (OR 3.46, 95 % CI, 1.39-8.63), and skull fracture (OR 2.67, 95 % CI, 1.28-5.58) were associated with HPC. Based on these factors, the HPC Score was derived (SAH = 2 points, SDH = 1 point, and skull fracture = 1 point). This score had an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.77. Patients with a score of 0-2 had a 4.0 % incidence of HPC, while patients with a score of 3-4 had a 34.6 % incidence of HPC. A simple HPC Score was developed for early risk stratification of HPC in patients with moderate or severe TBI.

27473877|t|Expressing sexuality in nursing homes. The experience of older women: A qualitative study
27473877|a|In nursing homes, a number of barriers to the expression of sexuality exist, such as the lack of privacy, certain attitudes on behalf of the staff and the family, the lack of a sexual partner, and physical limitations. The aim of this study was to describe the lived experience of sexuality in elderly Spanish women residing in nursing homes. A qualitative phenomenological approach was followed. Data were collected over an 18- month period between 2013 and 2015. Purposeful sampling was conducted with Spanish residents in nursing homes in Madrid. Data were collected using unstructured and semi-structured interviews. The data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Twenty female residents participated. Three main themes emerged from the data: a) expressing sexuality, b) sexuality as a duty and c) respecting vows. Female residents reported key elements influencing how they manage their sexuality in Nursing Homes. These results serve to improve our understanding regarding the expression of sexuality in older female nursing home residents.

27474557|t|Xylan-based temperature / pH sensitive hydrogels for drug controlled release
27474557|a|Xylan-based temperature / pH sensitive hydrogels were prepared by the crosslinking copolymerization of xylan with N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAm) and acrylic acid (AA) using N,Ń-methylenebis-acrylamide (MBA) as a cross-linker and 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone as a photoinitiator via ultraviolet irradiation. The influence of the NIPAm, AA and MBA amount on properties of xylan-based hydrogels was discussed. The morphology and interactions of hydrogels were characterized by SEM and FTIR. The lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of hydrogels was investigated by DSC. The results indicated that the LCST of hydrogels emerged at around 34°C and increased with increasing the AA content. The drug encapsulation efficiency of as-prepared hydrogels reached to 97.60% and the cumulative release rate of acetylsalicylic acid was 90.12% and 26.35% in the intestinal and gastric fluid, respectively. Xylan-based hydrogels were proved to be biocompatible with NIH3T3 cell by MTT assay and showed the promising application as drug carriers for the intestinal - targeted oral drug delivery.

27474570|t|Isolation and prebiotic activity of water-soluble polysaccharides fractions from the bamboo shoots (Phyllostachys praecox)
27474570|a|The water-soluble polysaccharides from bamboo shoots (Phyllostachys praecox) (WBP) were isolated, and the characterizations as well as prebiotic activities were investigated. The yield of WBP was 7.58±0.31% under optimal hot-water extraction conditions. Two fractions, i.e., WBP-1 and WBP-2 with molecular weight of 83.50kDa and 80.08kDa, respectively, were purified by chromatography. Both the polysaccharides fractions were identified as heteropolysaccharides-protein complexes composed of 15 kinds of common amino acids in protein part and rhamnose, arabinose, xylose, mannose, glucose and galactose in different molar ratios in polysaccharide part. The existence of α- and β-glycosidic linkages between the sugar units was confirmed by FTIR and NMR spectra. Compared with the blank control and the reference of FOS, WBP-1 and WBP-2 significantly increased the numbers of Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Bifidobacterium bifidum (P<0.05), which contributed to the production of organic acids, suggesting that the polysaccharides have potential prebiotic properties.

27478234|t|Evaluation of nutraceutical and antinutritional properties in barnyard and finger millet varieties grown in Himalayan region
27478234|a|Five elite varieties of barnyard (Echinochloa frumentacea) and finger (Eleusine coracana) growing at northwestern Himalaya were investigated for nutraceutical and antinutritional properties. Barnyard millet contained higher amount of crude fiber, total dietary fiber, tryptophan content, total carotenoids, α-tocopherol compared to the finger millet whereas the finger millet contains higher amount of methionine and ascorbic acid as compared to the barnyard millet. The secondary metabolites of biological functions were analyzed and found that barnyard millet contained the higher amount of polyphenols, tannins and ortho-dihydroxy phenol content compared to finger millet. Among antinutitional compounds barnyard millet contained lower phytic acid content compare to finger millet whereas no significant difference in trypsin inhibition activity of barnyard millet and finger millet varieties were found. Barnyard millet contained higher acid phosphatase, α-galactosidase and α-amylase inhibitor activity compared to finger millet. Finger millet seeds contained about 10-13 folds higher calcium content and double amount of manganese content in comparison to barnyard millet seeds. Present study suggests that barnyard millet varieties studied under present investigation were found nutritionally superior compared to finger millet varieties.

27481922|t|Polymorphisms in Inflammatory Mediator Genes and Risk of Preeclampsia in Taiyuan, China
27481922|a|Excessive maternal inflammatory response is involved in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. Few epidemiologic studies have investigated the associations between genetic variations in the inflammatory mediator genes and preeclampsia risk, and these studies have reached inconsistent results. We examined 31 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in IL-1A, IL-1B, IL-1R1, IL-2RA, IL-5RA, IL-6, IL-6R, TNFSF11, TNFRSF11A, IL-28RA, IRAK4, and KIT genes and the risk of preeclampsia and its clinical subtypes in a nested case-control study including 203 preeclampsia cases and 233 controls. We found that IL-1R1, IL-5RA, IL-6R, and TNFSF11 were associated with the risk of preeclampsia. Although the significant associations observed for preeclampsia overall were mainly seen for late-onset preeclampsia and severe preeclampsia, IL-6R (rs2229238) and TNFSF11 (rs9525643) polymorphisms were associated with the risk of early-onset preeclampsia. TNFSF11 (rs2200287 and rs2148072) polymorphisms were associated with risk of mild preeclampsia. Our study provided the first evidence that genetic variations in inflammatory mediator genes IL-1R1, IL-6R, TNFSF11, and IL-5RA were associated with preeclampsia risk, and the risk varied by preeclampsia subtypes.

27484091|t|A closer look at school bonding among African American adolescents in low-income communities: A latent class analysis
27484091|a|Positive school bonding is a significant precursor to students ' school success. However, African American youth report lower school success compared with their White counterparts. This study examined correlates of school bonding among 633 African American youth who were recruited from community settings in Chicago. Major findings indicated that negative peer norms, exposure to community violence, and poor mental health were negatively correlated with school bonding, while parental monitoring, positive self-regard, and future orientation were correlated with higher school motivation. Students classified as having high or moderate school bonding were more likely to live with both parents, experience higher levels of parental monitoring, and exhibit positive self-regard. Implications are discussed in view of these findings.

27487593|t|DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, STRESS, AND THEIR ASSOCIATED FACTORS AMONG CORPS MEMBERS SERVING IN KEBBI STATE
27487593|a|Depression, anxiety and stress, are not only health problems by themselves, but also associated with other negative health consequences. The national youth service is usually characterized by a number of new challenges and experiences which may require life style adjustments by the corps member. However, no previous study on psychological factors has been conducted among corps members. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of depression, anxiety and, stress and their associated factors among corps members serving in Kebbi state. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 264 corps members from four local government areas of the state. Selection of the local government areas and the individual participants was by simple random sampling. Data was collected from May to June 2014 using a self-administered questionnaire. Data analysis used chi-square test to identify the relationship between categorical variables and multivariate logistic regression to identify the independent factors for depression, anxiety and stress each. The response rate was 97%. Most of the respondents were males (63.6%), single (85.5%), and above 20 years of age (71.6%). The overall prevalences of depression, anxiety and stress among the respondents were 36.4%, 54.5% and 18.2% respectively. The independent factors for depression were; being from the North central (OR = 5.99; 95% CI: 2.194-16.354) or South-south; and the perception of earning enough income (OR = 2.987; 95% CI: 1.062-8.400). For anxiety, male gender (OR = 0.411; 95% CI: 0.169-0.999); and being from the North central were significant risk factors (OR = 3.731; 95% CI: 1.450-9.599). Being above 26 years of age was an independent risk factor for stress (OR = 0.083; 95% CI: 0.018-0.381). Also, those who had ever schooled outside their towns of residence were less likely to be stressed compared to those who had never (OR = 0.30; 95% CI: 0.110-0.855). All other factors did not show any significant association with any of the outcome variables in multivariate analysis. In conclusion, the prevalences of depression, anxiety and stress are high among corps members serving in Kebbi state. There is need to expand the scope of this study to a national level so as to get a bigger picture of the problem.

27489015|t|Trans-oral fine needle aspiration cytology in cervical (C1 and C2) vertebral lesions: a novel diagnostic approach
27489015|a|Fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology is a relatively non-invasive method for diagnosing both superficial and deep-seated neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions. In this study, we evaluated the diagnostic utility of trans-oral FNA in cervical (C1 and C2) vertebral and paravertebral lesions. Eighteen FNA cases of cervical vertebral and paravertebral lesions performed by a trans-oral route without any image-guidance between 1995 and 2014 were retrieved from the archives of the cytology department at PGIMER, Chandigarh and reviewed. Out of 18 cases, a definite diagnosis was given in 15 cases (83.3%). The commonest diagnosis seen was granulomatous inflammation consistent with tuberculosis (33.3%). Trans-oral FNA is a quick, inexpensive and relatively safe outpatient procedure for sampling C1 and C2 vertebral and paravertebral lesions, which are clinically and radiologically difficult to approach. It helps in the early diagnosis and management of these patients.

27491687|t|Neonatal infections: Case definition and guidelines for data collection, analysis, and presentation of immunisation safety data
27491687|a|Maternal vaccination is an important area of research and requires appropriate and internationally comparable definitions and safety standards. The GAIA group, part of the Brighton Collaboration was created with the mandate of proposing standardised definitions applicable to maternal vaccine research. This study proposes international definitions for neonatal infections. The neonatal infections GAIA working group performed a literature review using Medline, EMBASE and the Cochrane collaboration and collected definitions in use in neonatal and public health networks. The common criteria derived from the extensive search formed the basis for a consensus process that resulted in three separate definitions for neonatal blood stream infections (BSI), meningitis and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI). For each definition three levels of evidence are proposed to ensure the applicability of the definitions to different settings. Recommendations about data collection, analysis and presentation are presented and harmonized with the Brighton Collaboration and GAIA format and other existing international standards for study reporting.

27491778|t|Beneficial effects of dark chocolate on exercise capacity in sedentary subjects: underlying mechanisms. A double blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial
27491778|a|In heart failure patients the consumption of (-)-epicatechin ((-)-Epi)-rich cocoa can restore skeletal muscle (SkM) mitochondrial structure and decrease biomarkers of oxidative stress. However, nothing is known about its effects on exercise capacity and underlying mechanisms in normal, sedentary subjects. Twenty normal, sedentary subjects (∼50 years old) were randomized to placebo or dark chocolate (DC) groups and consumed 20 g of the products for 3 months. Subjects underwent before and after treatment, bicycle ergometry to assess VO2 max and work, SkM biopsy to assess changes in mitochondrial density, function and oxidative stress and blood sampling to assess metabolic endpoints. Seventeen subjects completed the trial. In the DC group (n = 9), VO2 max increased (17% increase, p = 0.056) as well as maximum work (watts) achieved (p = 0.026) with no changes with placebo (n = 8). The DC group evidenced increases in HDL levels (p = 0.005) and decreased triglycerides (p = 0.07). With DC, SkM evidenced significant increases in protein levels for LKB1, AMPK and PGC1α and in their active forms (phosphorylated AMPK and LKB1) as well as in citrate synthase activity while no changes were observed in mitochondrial density. With DC, significant increases in SkM reduced glutathione levels and decreases in protein carbonylation were observed. Improvements in maximum work achieved and VO2 max may be due to DC activation of upstream control systems and enhancement of SkM mitochondria efficiency. Larger clinical studies are warranted to confirm these observations.

27494020|t|Reduction in Hospital-Wide Clinical Laboratory Specimen Identification Errors following Process Interventions: A 10- Year Retrospective Observational Study
27494020|a|Accurate patient identification and specimen labeling at the time of collection are crucial steps in the prevention of medical errors, thereby improving patient safety. All patient specimen identification errors that occurred in the outpatient department (OPD), emergency department (ED), and inpatient department (IPD) of a 3,800- bed academic medical center in Taiwan were documented and analyzed retrospectively from 2005 to 2014. To reduce such errors, the following series of strategies were implemented: a restrictive specimen acceptance policy for the ED and IPD in 2006; a computer-assisted barcode positive patient identification system for the ED and IPD in 2007 and 2010, and automated sample labeling combined with electronic identification systems introduced to the OPD in 2009. Of the 2000345 specimens collected in 2005, 1023 (0.0511%) were identified as having patient identification errors, compared with 58 errors (0.0015%) among 3761238 specimens collected in 2014, after serial interventions; this represents a 97% relative reduction. The total number (rate) of institutional identification errors contributed from the ED, IPD, and OPD over a 10- year period were 423 (0.1058%), 556 (0.0587%), and 44 (0.0067%) errors before the interventions, and 3 (0.0007%), 52 (0.0045%) and 3 (0.0001%) after interventions, representing relative 99%, 92% and 98% reductions, respectively. Accurate patient identification is a challenge of patient safety in different health settings. The data collected in our study indicate that a restrictive specimen acceptance policy, computer-generated positive identification systems, and interdisciplinary cooperation can significantly reduce patient identification errors.

27494908|t|Management of skin and soft-tissue infections at a community teaching hospital using a severity-of-illness tool
27494908|a|Skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs) encompass a diverse range of infections of varying severity. The Clinical Resource Efficiency Support Team (CREST) scoring system stratifies patients into four classes (I = least severe to IV = most severe) based on the Standardized Early Warning Score (SEWS). The objective of this study was to apply CREST to hospitalized patients with SSTIs in order to quantify disease severity and evaluate appropriateness of antibiotic management. This was a retrospective, hypothesis -generating, single-centre evaluation of hospitalized patients with SSTIs admitted in 2011. Based on CREST classification, the empirical antimicrobial choices were categorized as appropriate, over-treatment or under-treatment. A total of 369 patients were screened and 200 met the inclusion criteria. The majority of patients were classified as either CREST class I (n = 68) or class I I (n = 102). Over-treatment was more common in the less severe classes (88% and 32% in class I and class II, respectively; P < 0.05). Sixty-three percent of class I (n = 43) were over-treated due to both the use of intravenous antibiotic s when oral therapy was sufficient and use of unnecessarily broad-spectrum antibiotics. In contrast, 25% (n = 26) of class II were over-treated due to use of unnecessarily broad-spectrum antibiotics. Overall clinical failure rates remained low with only 1%, 4% and 17% of patients unable to achieve initial response in class II, class III and class IV. Retrospective application of CREST identified opportunities to improve the management of SSTIs. CREST can be of great value in discriminating less- severe SSTIs, which can be treated on an outpatient basis.

27495798|t|Breakthrough viridans streptococcal bacteremia in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients receiving levofloxacin prophylaxis in a Japanese hospital
27495798|a|Breakthrough viridans streptococcal bacteremia (VSB) in patients with hematological malignancy receiving levofloxacin prophylaxis is a major blood stream infection (BSI) occurring during febrile neutropenia. However, clinical data focused on VSB in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT) recipients are lacking. The medical records of allo-HSCT recipients who received oral levofloxacin prophylaxis between January 2011 and August 2013 at Toranomon Hospital were reviewed to evaluate breakthrough VSB. Stored viridans streptococcal (VGS) species were identified by using sodA gene sequencing, and were assessed for drug susceptibility. Among the 184 allo-HSCT recipients on levofloxacin prophylaxis, 28 (15.2 %) experienced breakthrough VSB. All of the 28 recipients with VSB were treated with a cefepime - based or piperacillin/tazobactam - based regimen. The susceptibility rates of the VGS strains for levofloxacin, cefepime, piperacillin/tazobactam, meropenem, and vancomycin were 0 %, 95 %, 100 %, 100 %, and 100 %, respectively. Both the MIC50 (minimum inhibitory concentration) and the MIC90 of ceftazidim (0.5 μg/mL and 2 μg/mL, respectively) were higher than the MIC90 of all the other anti-pseudomonal beta-lactams (APBLs). Only 1 VGS strain had a penicillin MIC ≥ 2 μg/mL by the Etest (3.6 %). There were no cases with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that was associated with VSB, although the rate of viridans group streptococcal shock syndrome was high (26 %). The crude 30-day mortality rate in the VSB group (10.7 %) did not differ significantly from that in the BSI without VSB group (9.3 %) or non - BSI group (7.0 %) (P = 0.77). Also, VSB was not a risk factor for all-cause mortality up to 60 days following allo-HSCT (P = 0.43). APBL with increased anti-VGS activity (APBL-VA) monotherapy would typically be optimal for treating the VGS strains in this setting. Indication of adding an empiric anti-gram-positive agent to APBL-VA for treating VSB should depend on local factors, such as the susceptibility results. In addition, breakthrough VSB is probably not a major cause of death in allo-HSCT settings, where beta-lactam non-susceptible VGS and the ARDS are rare.

We sought to determine how many splenectomies or splenorrhaphies for trauma the average pediatric surgeon can be expected to perform during their career. The Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) Database was queried for patients ≤18 years coded with an International Classification of Diseases 9th Edition diagnosis code of a splenic injury from 2004 to 2013. Age, gender, grade of splenic injury, and operations performed were extracted. Numbers of pediatric surgeons per hospital were obtained. 9567 children were identified. 2.1% underwent a splenectomy and 0.8% underwent a splenorrhaphy. The average surgeon performed 0.6 (SD=0.6) splenectomies and 0.2 (SD=0.4) splenorrhaphies for trauma. If these rates remain constant over time, the average surgeon would perform 1.8 (SD =1.7) splenectomies and 0.6 (SD =1.1) splenorrhaphies for trauma over a 30- year surgical career. Nonoperative management is associated with a host of benefits, but has resulted in a decrease in the experience level of the pediatric surgeons expected to perform an emergency splenectomy or splenorrhaphy when the unusual occasion arises.

27498399|t|Vestibular -dependent inter-stimulus interval effects on sound evoked potentials of central origin
27498399|a|Todd et al. (2014ab) have recently demonstrated the presence of vestibular -dependent contributions to auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) when passing through the vestibular threshold as determined by vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMPs), including a particular deflection labeled as an N42/P52 prior to the long - latency AEPs N1 and P2. In this paper we report the results of an experiment to determine the effect of inter-stimulus interval (ISI) and regularity on potentials recorded above and below VEMP threshold. Five healthy, right-handed subjects were recruited and evoked potentials were recorded to binaurally presented sound stimulation, above and below vestibular threshold, at seven stimulus rates with ISIs of 212, 300, 424, 600, 848, 1200 and 1696 ms. The inner five intervals, i.e. 300, 424, 600, 848, 1200 ms, were presented twice in both regular and irregular conditions. ANOVA on the global field power (GFP) were conducted for each of four waves, N42, P52, N1 and P2 with factors of intensity, ISI and regularity. Both N42 and P52 waves showed significant ANOVA effects of intensity but no other main effects or interactions. In contrast both N1 and P2 showed additional effects of ISI, as well as intensity, and evidence of non - linear interactions between ISI and intensity. A source analysis was carried out consistent with prior work suggesting that when above vestibular threshold, in addition to bilateral superior temporal cortex, ocular, cerebellar and cingulate sources are recruited. Further statistical analysis of the source currents indicated that the origin of the interactions with intensity may be the ISI sensitivity of the vestibular -dependent sources. This in turn may reflect a specific vestibular preference for stimulus rates associated with locomotion, i.e. rates close to 2 Hz, or ISIs close to 500 ms, where saccular afferents show increased gain and the corresponding reflexes are most sensitive.

27500198|t|A Systematic Review of the Diagnostic and Prognostic Value of Urinary Protein Biomarkers in Urothelial Bladder Cancer
27500198|a|For over 80 years, cystoscopy has remained the gold-standard for detecting tumours of the urinary bladder. Since bladder tumours have a tendency to recur and progress, many patients are subjected to repeated cystoscopies during long-term surveillance, with the procedure being both unpleasant for the patient and expensive for healthcare providers. The identification and validation of bladder tumour specific molecular markers in urine could enable tumour detection and reduce reliance on cystoscopy, and numerous classes of biomarkers have been studied. Proteins represent the most intensively studied class of biomolecule in this setting. As an aid to researchers searching for better urinary biomarkers, we report a comprehensive systematic review of the literature and a searchable database of proteins that have been investigated to date. Our objective was to classify these proteins as: 1) those with robustly characterised sensitivity and specificity for bladder cancer detection; 2) those that show potential but further investigation is required; 3) those unlikely to warrant further investigation; and 4) those investigated as prognostic markers. This work should help to prioritise certain biomarkers for rigorous validation, whilst preventing wasted effort on proteins that have shown no association whatsoever with the disease, or only modest biomarker performance despite large-scale efforts at validation.

27500262|t|Well, I Wouldn't be Any Worse Off, Would I, Than I am Now? A Qualitative Study of Decision-Making, Hopes, and Realities of Adults With Type 1 Diabetes Undergoing Islet Cell Transplantation
27500262|a|For selected individuals with type 1 diabetes, pancreatic islet transplantation (IT) prevents recurrent severe hypoglycemia and optimizes glycemia, although ongoing systemic immunosuppression is needed. Our aim was to explore candidates and recipients ' expectations of transplantation, their experience of being on the waiting list, and (for recipients) the procedure and life posttransplant. Cross-sectional qualitative research design using semistructured interviews with 16 adults (8 pretransplant, 8 posttransplant; from 4 UK centers (n = 13) and 1 Canadian center (n = 3)). Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and underwent inductive thematic analysis. Interviewees were aged (mean ± SD) 52 ± 10 years (range, 30-64); duration of diabetes, 36 ± 9 years (range, 21-56); 12 (75%) were women. Narrative accounts centered on expectations, hopes, and realities; decision-making; waiting and uncertainty; the procedure, hospital stay, and follow-up. Expected benefits included fewer severe hypoglycemic episodes, reduced need for insulin, preventing onset/progression of complications and improved psychological well-being. These were realized for most, at least in the short term. Most interviewees described well-informed, shared decision-making with clinicians and family, and managing their expectations. Although life "on the list" could be stressful, and immunosuppressant side effects were severe, interviewees reported " no regrets ." Posttransplant, interviewees experienced increased confidence, through freedom from hypoglycemia and regained glycemic control, which tempered any disappointment about continued reliance on insulin. Most viewed their transplant as a success, though several reflected upon setbacks and hidden hopes for becoming " insulin-free ." Independently undertaken interviews demonstrated realistic and balanced expectations of IT and indicate how to optimize the process and support for future IT candidates.

27500809|t|The nanocomposite nature of bone drives its strength and damage resistance
27500809|a|In human bone, an amorphous mineral serves as a precursor to the formation of a highly substituted nanocrystalline apatite. However, the precise role of this amorphous mineral remains unknown. Here, we show by using transmission electron microscopy that 100-300 nm amorphous calcium phosphate regions are present in the disordered phase of trabecular bone. Nanomechanical experiments on cylindrical samples, with diameters between 250 nm and 3,000 nm, of the bone's ordered and disordered phases revealed a transition from plastic deformation to brittle failure and at least a factor-of-2 higher strength in the smaller samples. We postulate that this transition in failure mechanism is caused by the suppression of extrafibrillar shearing in the smaller samples, and that the emergent smaller -is- stronger size effect is related to the sample-size scaling of the distribution of flaws. Our findings should help in the understanding of the multi-scale nature of bone and provide insights into the biomineralization process.

27501910|t|Assessing the physiological relevance of alternate architectures of the p7 protein of hepatitis C virus in different environments
27501910|a|The viroporin p7 of the hepatitis C virus forms multimeric channels eligible for ion transport across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Currently the subject of many studies and discussion, the molecular assembly of the ion channel and the structural characteristics of the p7 monomer are not yet fully understood. Structural investigation of p7 has been carried out only in detergent environments, making the interpretation of the experimental results somewhat questionable. Here, we analyze by means of molecular dynamics simulations the structure of the p7 monomer as a function of its sequence, initial conformation and environment. We investigate the conductance properties of three models of a hexameric p7 ion channel by examining ion translocation in a pure lipid bilayer. It is noteworthy that although none of the models reflects the experimentally observed trend to conduct preferentially cations, we were able to identify the position and orientation of titratable acidic or basic residues playing a crucial role in ion selectivity and in the overall conductance of the channel. In addition, too compact a packing of the monomers leads to channel collapse rather than formation of a reasonable pore, amenable to ion translocation. The present findings are envisioned to help assess the physiological relevance of p7 ion channel models consisting of multimeric structures obtained in non-native environments.

27502941|t|The genome -scale DNA-binding profile of BarR, a β-alanine responsive transcription factor in the archaeon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius
27502941|a|The Leucine-responsive Regulatory Protein (Lrp) family is a widespread family of regulatory transcription factors in prokaryotes. BarR is an Lrp -like transcription factor in the model archaeon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius that activates the expression of a β-alanine aminotransferase gene, which is involved in β-alanine degradation. In contrast to classical Lrp -like transcription factors, BarR is not responsive to any of the α-amino acids but interacts specifically with β-alanine. Besides the juxtaposed β-alanine aminotransferase gene, other regulatory targets of BarR have not yet been identified although β-alanine is the precursor of coenzyme A and thus an important central metabolite. The aim of this study is to extend the knowledge of the DNA-binding characteristics of BarR and of its corresponding regulon from a local to a genome -wide perspective. We characterized the genome-wide binding profile of BarR using chromatin immunoprecipation combined with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq). This revealed 21 genomic binding loci. High-enrichment binding regions were validated to interact with purified BarR protein in vitro using electrophoretic mobility shift assays and almost all targets were also shown to harbour a conserved semi-palindromic binding motif. Only a small subset of enriched genomic sites are located in intergenic regions at a relative short distance to a promoter, and qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated that only one additional operon is under activation of BarR, namely the glutamine synthase operon. The latter is also a target of other Lrp -like transcription factors. Detailed inspection of the BarR ChIP-seq profile at the β-alanine aminotransferase promoter region in combination with binding motif predictions indicate that the operator structure is more complicated than previously anticipated, consisting of multiple (major and auxiliary) operators. BarR has a limited regulon, and includes also glutamine synthase genes besides the previously characterized β-alanine aminotransferase. Regulation of glutamine synthase is suggestive of a link between β-alanine and α-amino acid metabolism in S. acidocaldarius. Furthermore, this work reveals that the BarR regulon overlaps with that of other Lrp -like regulators.

27503472|t|GH32 family activity: a topological approach through protein contact networks
27503472|a|The application of Protein Contact Networks methodology allowed to highlight a novel response of border region between the two domains to substrate binding. Glycoside hydrolases (GH) are enzymes that mainly hydrolyze the glycosidic bond between two carbohydrates or a carbohydrate and a non-carbohydrate moiety. These enzymes are involved in many fundamental and diverse biological processes in plants. We have focused on the GH32 family, including enzymes very similar in both sequence and structure, each having however clear specificities of substrate preferences and kinetic properties. Structural and topological differences among proteins of the GH32 family have been here identified by means of an emerging approach (Protein Contact network, PCN) based on the formalization of 3D structures as contact networks among amino-acid residues. The PCN approach proved successful in both reconstructing the already known functional domains and in identifying the structural counterpart of the properties of GH32 enzymes, which remain uncertain, like their allosteric character. The main outcome of the study was the discovery of the activation upon binding of the border (cleft) region between the two domains. This reveals the allosteric nature of the enzymatic activity for all the analyzed forms in the GH32 family, a character yet to be highlighted in biochemical studies. Furthermore, we have been able to recognize a topological signature (graph energy) of the different affinity of the enzymes towards small and large substrates.

27504100|t|Multivariate Imaging Genetics Study of MRI Gray Matter Volume and SNPs Reveals Biological Pathways Correlated with Brain Structural Differences in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
27504100|a|Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder affecting children, adolescents, and adults. Its etiology is not well understood, but it is increasingly believed to result from diverse pathophysiologies that affect the structure and function of specific brain circuits. Although one of the best-studied neurobiological abnormalities in ADHD is reduced fronto-striatal-cerebellar gray matter (GM) volume, its specific genetic correlates are largely unknown. In this study, T1-weighted MR images of brain structure were collected from 198 adolescents (63 ADHD - diagnosed). A multivariate parallel independent component analysis (Para-ICA) technique -identified imaging genetic relationships between regional GM volume and single nucleotide polymorphism data. Para-ICA analyses extracted 14 components from genetic data and 9 from MR data. An iterative cross-validation using randomly chosen subsamples indicated acceptable stability of these ICA solutions. A series of partial correlation analyses controlling for age, sex, and ethnicity revealed two genotype-phenotype component pairs significantly differed between ADHD and non-ADHD groups, after a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. The brain phenotype component not only included structures frequently found to have abnormally low volume in previous ADHD studies but was also significantly associated with ADHD differences in symptom severity and performance on cognitive tests frequently found to be impaired in patients diagnosed with the disorder. Pathway analysis of the genotype component identified several different biological pathways linked to these structural abnormalities in ADHD. Some of these pathways implicate well-known dopaminergic neurotransmission and neurodevelopment hypothesized to be abnormal in ADHD. Other more recently implicated pathways included glutamatergic and GABA-eric physiological systems; others might reflect sources of shared liability to disturbances commonly found in ADHD, such as sleep abnormalities.

27504422|t|Clinicopathological and Immunohistochemical Characteristics of Verruciform Xanthoma of the Lower Gingiva: A Case Report
27504422|a|Verruciform xanthoma (VX) is a rare benign lesion and mainly effects the oral mucosa. This slow-growing asymptomatic lesion typically develops along the gingival margin of the masticatory mucosa, followed by the hard palate, tongue, buccal mucosa, floor of the mouth, alveolar mucosa, soft palate and junction between the hard and soft palate. Moreover, this lesion can also affect the skin and genital organs. Clinically, VX generally presents a sessile or pedunculated appearance, forming a papule or single plaque with verrucous or papillomatous mucosal growth. The colour (white, pink, grey, or yellow) depends on the thickness of the overlying epidermis. In fact, the clinical findings of VX are similar to those of verrucous carcinoma and other benign tumours, such as squamous papilloma, verruca vulgaris and mucosal fibroma. For this reason, clinical and histopathological examinations are essential for accurate differential diagnosis. Histologically, VX is characterized by parakeratosis, rete ridges of uniform depth and the accumulation of foam cells, which are also called " xanthoma cells ". Here, we describe the clinicopathological and immunohistochemical findings of a VX located on the lower gingiva of a 64-year-old male patient.

27507301|t|MicroRNA 101b Is Downregulated in the Prefrontal Cortex of a Genetic Model of Depression and Targets the Glutamate Transporter SLC1A1 (EAAT3) in Vitro
27507301|a|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small regulatory molecules that cause translational repression by base pairing with target mRNAs. Cumulative evidence suggests that changes in miRNA expression may in part underlie the pathophysiology and treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD). A miRNA expression assay that can simultaneously detect 423 rat miRNAs (miRBase v.17) was used to profile the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of a genetic rat model of MDD (the Flinders Sensitive Line [FSL]) and the controls, the Flinders Resistant Line (FRL). Gene expression data from the PFC of FSL / FRL animals (GEO accession no. GSE20388) were used to guide mRNA target selection. Luciferase reporter assays were used to verify miRNA targets in vitro. We identified 23 miRNAs that were downregulated in the PFC of the FSL model compared with controls. Interestingly, one of the identified miRNAs (miR-101b) is highly conserved between rat and human and was recently found to be downregulated in the PFC of depressed suicide subjects. Using a combination of in silico and in vitro analyses, we found that miR-101b targets the neuronal glutamate transporter SLC1A1 (also known as EAAC1 or EAAT3). Accordingly, both mRNA and protein levels of SLC1A1 were found to be upregulated in the PFC of the FSL model. Besides providing a list of novel miRNAs associated with depression-like states, this preclinical study replicated the human association of miR-101 with depression. In addition, since one of the targets of miR-101b appears to be a glutamate transporter, our preclinical data support the hypothesis of a glutamatergic dysregulation being implicated in the etiology of depression.

27508301|t|Incidence of Diabetes Mellitus and Obesity and the Overlap of Comorbidities in HIV+ Hispanics Initiating Antiretroviral Therapy
27508301|a|Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading health threat for HIV+ patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART); cardiometabolic comorbidities are key predictors of risk. Data are limited on incidence of metabolic comorbidities in HIV+ individuals initiating ART in low and middle income countries (LMICs), particularly for Hispanics. We examined incidence of diabetes and obesity in a prospective cohort of those initiating ART in the Dominican Republic. Participants ≥18 years, initiating ART <90 days prior to study enrollment, were examined for incidence of impaired fasting glucose (IFG), diabetes mellitus (DM), overweight, and obesity. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 100-125mg/dl defined IFG; FPG ≥126 mg/dl, diagnosis per medical record, or use of hypoglycemic medication defined DM. Overweight and obesity were BMI 25-30 and ≥30kg/m2, respectively. Dyslipidemia was total cholesterol ≥240mg/dl or use of lipid-lowering medication. Framingham risk equation was used to determine ten-year CVD risk at the end of observation. Of 153 initiating ART, 8 (6%) had DM and 23 (16%) had IFG at baseline, 6 developed DM (28/1000 person - years follow up [PYFU]) and 46 developed IFG (329/1000 PYFU). At baseline, 24 (18%) were obese and 36 (27%) were overweight, 15 became obese (69/1000 PYFU) and 22 became overweight (163/1000 PYFU). Median observation periods for the diabetes and obesity analyses were 23.5 months and 24.3 months, respectively. Increased CVD risk (≥10% 10-year Framingham risk score) was present for 13% of the cohort; 79% of the cohort had ≥1 cardiometabolic comorbidity, 48% had ≥2, and 13% had all three. In this Hispanic cohort in an LMIC, incidences of IFG / DM and overweight / obesity were similar to or higher than that found in high income countries, and cardiometabolic disorders affected three-quarters of those initiating ART. Care models incorporating cardiovascular risk reduction into HIV treatment programs are needed to prevent CVD - associated mortality in this vulnerable population.

27508328|t|Laparoscopic Approach for Thermoablation Microwave in the Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Single Center Experience
27508328|a|The surgical therapy of choice for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is liver transplantation (LT) or hepatic resection, although only a small percentage of patients can undergo these procedures. Microwave thermal ablation (MWTA) can be an effective alternative treatment for HCC that complicates a cirrhotic liver disease, either as a final procedure or for downstaging patients on the waiting list for LT, or in combination with resective surgery to achieve oncological radicality. The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate experience with the laparoscopic approach of MWTA at our center. In a cohort of 35 consecutive patients undergoing MWTA with laparoscopic approach between January, 2013 and May, 2016, we reviewed the demographic data, the Barcelona clinic liver cancer stage, the severity of cirrhotic liver disease, the size of the ablated lesion, the duration of the procedure, and complications occurring within 90 days of surgery. MWTA was performed by applying one to three hepatic parenchymal insertions (mean 1.8) per patient. The mean duration of surgery was 163 ± 18 minutes. There was no blood loss in any of the procedures. Complete necrosis on CT scan was achieved in 26/35 patients (75%). The mean hospital stay was 4.6 (range 2-7) days; major complications were postablation syndrome in 2/35 (5.7%), peritoneal fluid in 4/35 (11.4%), and transient jaundice in 1/35 (2.8%) patients. There was no mortality. Laparoscopic MWTA is a safe and effective treatment for unresectable HCC and when a percutaneous procedure is not feasible.

27510571|t|Structured Instruction With Modified Storybooks to Teach Morphosyntax and Vocabulary to Preschoolers Who are Deaf / Hard of Hearing
27510571|a|Children who are deaf / hard of hearing (D / HH) are at risk for diminished morphosyntactical and vocabulary development. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of repeated reading combined with structured instruction. Targets were a morphosyntactical form and novel vocabulary words. Participants were 3 preschoolers who are D / HH who were receiving instruction with an oral approach. Data from a multiple baseline design indicated that all children acquired the targeted skills and demonstrated high levels of generalization of these skills to untrained context. Implications for teaching young children who are D / HH using repeated storybook reading are discussed.

27510784|t|Application of BRAF V600E mutation - specific immunohistochemistry in diagnosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumors
27510784|a|To evaluate the utility of BRAF V600E allele - specific antibody in the diagnosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). BRAF V600E mutation - specific immunohistochemistry and BRAF sequencing were performed in 24 consecutive GISTs, including 14 cases of KIT or PDGFRA mutations and 10 cases of KIT / PDGFRA wild GISTs. GISTs of 11 men and 13 women with a mean age 54 years(range 29-75 years) were included with tumors arising from stomach (16 cases), small bowel (7 cases), and peritoneal cavity (1 case). Strong and diffuse cytoplasmic BRAF staining was noted in 4 of 24 cases (17%), while 1 of 24 cases (4%) showed weak staining, and 19 of 24 cases (79%) had no staining. The four cases with strong BRAF immunostain were confirmed to have BRAF mutations, including 3 cases in the stomach and 1 case in the small intestine. All tumors showed spindle cell morphology. Only one case had progressive disease. No BRAF mutations were detected in cases with weak or negative BRAF immunostain. BRAF V600E mutation - specific immunohistochemistry is a highly sensitive and specific marker for detecting BRAF-mutated GISTs.

27511525|t|Efficacy of pegylated liposomal etoposide nanoparticles on breast cancer cell lines
27511525|a|This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of pegylated liposomal etoposide nanoparticles (NPs) against T-47D and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines. Pegylated liposomal etoposide NPs were prepared by reverse phase evaporation method. The size, size distribution, and zeta potential of the NPs was measured by a Zetasizer instrument. The cytotoxicity of NPs was inspected by methyl thiazol tetrazolium assay. The release pattern of the drug from the vesicles was studied by the dialysis method. Drug loading and encapsulation efficiency (EE) were also measured. The mean size, size distribution, and zeta potential of pegylated liposomal etoposide NPs were 491 ± 15.5 nm, 0.504 ± 0.14, and -35.8 ± 2.5 mV, respectively. Drug loading and EE were 10.3 ± 1.6% and 99.1 ± 2.8%, respectively. The etoposide release in the formulation was estimated at about 3.48% after 48 h. The cytotoxicity effect of etoposide NPs on T-47D and MCF-7 cell lines of breast cancer showed higher antitumor activity as compared with those of the free drug. Liposome-based NPs may hold great potential as a drug delivery system.

27511629|t|The Bindex(®) ultrasound device: reliability of cortical bone thickness measures and their relationship to regional bone mineral density
27511629|a|The Bindex(®) quantitative ultrasound (QUS) device is currently available and this study analyzed (I) its relative and absolute intra- and inter-session reliability and (II) the relationship between the data provided by Bindex(®)-QUS and the bone mineral density (BMD) measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at corresponding skeletal sites in young and healthy subjects (age: 25.0 ± 3.6 years). Bindex(®)-QUS calculates a density index on the basis of the thickness of cortical bone measured at the distal radius and the distal plus proximal tibia. The data show a very good relative and absolute intra- (ICC = 0.977, CV = 1.5%) and inter-session reliability (ICC = 0.978, CV = 1.4%) for the density index. The highest positive correlations were found between cortical thickness and BMD for the distal radius and distal tibia (r ⩾ 0.71, p < 0.001). The data indicate that the Bindex(®)-QUS parameters are repeatable within and between measurement sessions. Furthermore, the measurements reflect the BMD at specific skeletal sites. Bindex(®)-QUS might be a useful tool for the measurement of skeletal adaptations.

27514242|t|Botulinum Toxin Use in Refractory Pain and Other Symptoms in Parkinsonism
27514242|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) and other parkinsonian syndromes are chronic, progressive neurodegenerative diseases. With advancing disease, both motor and non-motor symptoms represent a considerable burden and symptom relief and quality of life improvement become the main goal of treatment. Botulinum toxins (BTX) are an effective treatment modality for many neurological conditions. To understand the potential usefulness of BTX in this population, we performed a retrospective chart review of all patients with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic PD and atypical parkinsonism who received treatment with BTX injections in our center from 1995 to 2014 for a variety of symptoms. Response to BTX was assessed using a subjective Clinical Global Impression. Records of 160 patients were reviewed. Probable idiopathic PD was the diagnosis in 117 patients (73.1%). The main indication for BTX treatment was pain (50.6% of cases). Other indications were the treatment of functional impairment resulting from dystonia (26.25%), sialorrhea (18.75%), freezing of gait, and camptocormia. Considering pain as indication, 81% of all patients with PD reported benefits after the first BTX injections. This benefit was maintained after the last recorded visit without significant difference in outcome compared with the first injection (p=0.067). Similar results were observed in patients with atypical parkinsonism. Our results confirm the safety and efficacy of different uses of BTX in the symptomatic treatment of patients with parkinsonism even in advanced stages of the disease, and suggest BTX treatment could have a safe and useful role in the treatment of pain in this population.

27516217|t|Chronic exposure to haloperidol and olanzapine leads to common and divergent shape changes in the rat hippocampus in the absence of grey-matter volume loss
27516217|a|One of the most consistently reported brain abnormalities in schizophrenia (SCZ) is decreased volume and shape deformation of the hippocampus. However, the potential contribution of chronic antipsychotic medication exposure to these phenomena remains unclear. We examined the effect of chronic exposure (8 weeks) to clinically relevant doses of either haloperidol (HAL) or olanzapine (OLZ) on adult rat hippocampal volume and shape using ex vivo structural MRI with the brain retained inside the cranium to prevent distortions due to dissection, followed by tensor-based morphometry (TBM) and elastic surface-based shape deformation analysis. The volume of the hippocampus was also measured post-mortem from brain tissue sections in each group. Chronic exposure to either HAL or OLZ had no effect on the volume of the hippocampus, even at exploratory thresholds, which was confirmed post-mortem. In contrast, shape deformation analysis revealed that chronic HAL and OLZ exposure lead to both common and divergent shape deformations (q = 0.05, FDR-corrected) in the rat hippocampus. In particular, in the dorsal hippocampus, HAL exposure led to inward shape deformation, whereas OLZ exposure led to outward shape deformation. Interestingly, outward shape deformations that were common to both drugs occurred in the ventral hippocampus. These effects remained significant after controlling for hippocampal volume suggesting true shape changes. Chronic exposure to either HAL or OLZ leads to both common and divergent effects on rat hippocampal shape in the absence of volume change. The implications of these findings for the clinic are discussed.

27516254|t|Shear and extensional properties of kefiran
27516254|a|Kefiran is a neutral polysaccharide constituted by glucose and galactose produced by Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens. It is included into kefir grains and has several health promoting properties. In the present work, shear and extensional properties of different kefiran aqueous dispersions (0.5, 1 and 2% wt.) were assessed and compared to other neutral gums commonly used in food, cosmetic and pharmaceutics industries (methylcellulose, locust bean gum and guar gum). Kefiran showed shear flow characteristics similar to that displayed by other representative neutral gums, although it always yielded lower viscosities at a given concentration. For each gum system it was possible to find a correlation between dynamic and steady shear properties by a master curve including both the apparent and complex viscosities. When studying extensional properties of selected gums at 2% wt. by means of a capillary break-up rheometer, kefiran solutions did not show important extensional properties, displaying a behaviour close the Newtonian.

27516791|t|Air tamponade of the heart
27516791|a|Pneumopericardium is a rare disease defined as the presence of air or gas in the pericardial sac. Among the etiological factors, the following stand out: chest trauma, barotrauma, air -containing fistulas between the pericardium and the surrounding structures, secondary gas production by microorganisms growing in the pericardial sac, and iatrogenic factors. Until now, spontaneous pneumopericardium has been considered a harmless and temporary state, but a review of clinical cases indicates that the presence of air in the pericardium can lead to cardiac tamponade and life-threatening hemodynamic disturbances. We present the case of an 80- year-old patient with a chronic bronchopericardial fistula, who suffered from a cardiac arrest due to air tamponade of the heart.

27517885|t|The Complete Chloroplast Genome Sequence of the Medicinal Plant Swertia mussotii Using the PacBio RS II Platform
27517885|a|Swertia mussotii is an important medicinal plant that has great economic and medicinal value and is found on the Qinghai Tibetan Plateau. The complete chloroplast (cp) genome of S. mussotii is 153,431 bp in size, with a pair of inverted repeat (IR) regions of 25,761 bp each that separate an large single-copy (LSC) region of 83,567 bp and an a small single-copy (SSC) region of 18,342 bp. The S. mussotii cp genome encodes 84 protein-coding genes, 37 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, and eight ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes. The identity, number, and GC content of S. mussotii cp genes were similar to those in the genomes of other Gentianales species. Via analysis of the repeat structure, 11 forward repeats, eight palindromic repeats, and one reverse repeat were detected in the S. mussotii cp genome. There are 45 SSRs in the S. mussotii cp genome, the majority of which are mononucleotides found in all other Gentianales species. An entire cp genome comparison study of S. mussotii and two other species in Gentianaceae was conducted. The complete cp genome sequence provides intragenic information for the cp genetic engineering of this medicinal plant.

27519886|t|Meta-Analysis of 29 Experiments Evaluating the Effects of Rapamycin on Life Span in the Laboratory Mouse
27519886|a|Rapamycin has favorable effects on aging in mice and may eventually be applied to encourage " healthy aging " in humans. This study analyzed raw data from 29 survival studies of rapamycin - and control - treated mice, with the goals of estimating summary statistics and identifying factors associated with effect size heterogeneity. Meta-analysis demonstrated significant heterogeneity across studies, with hazard ratio (HR) estimates ranging from 0.22 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.06-0.82) to 0.92 (95% CI: 0.65-1.28). Sex was the major factor accounting for effect size variation, and mortality was decreased more in females (HR = 0.41; 95% CI: 0.35-0.48) as compared with males (HR = 0.63; 95% CI: 0.55-0.71). Rapamycin effects were also genotype dependent, however, with stronger survivorship increases in hybrid mice (14.4%; 95% CI: 12.5-16.3%) relative to pure inbred strains (8.8%; 95% CI: 6.2-11.6%). Number needed to treat was applied as an effect size metric, which consistently identified early senescence as the age of peak treatment benefit. These results provide synthesis of existing data to support the potential translation of findings from mouse to primate species. Because rapamycin's effect on survival depends on sex and genotype, further work is justified to understand how these factors shape treatment response.

27521864|t|Transfusion medicine in medical education: an analysis of curricular grids in Brazil and a review of the current literature
27521864|a|Blood transfusions are one of the most performed medical procedures in the world. Thus, as education in transfusion medicine is vital to medical care, it should aim to promote a responsible practice with the rational use of blood by doctors. This study aims to investigate the situation of the teaching of transfusion medicine in medical schools in Brazil. The websites of the 249 Brazilian medical schools in operation in June 2015 were visited and the curricula of the medical courses were investigated in respect to the presence or absence of a transfusion medicine discipline. When available, the subject grids were analyzed to verify whether a description of content regarding transfusion medicine was given within other disciplines. Of the 249 medical school sites visited, information on the curriculum was obtained from 178. Of the medical schools that published their curriculum, 132 (74.1%) did not have disciplines of transfusion medicine or hematology and only seven (3.9%) had a discipline of transfusion medicine in the curricular grid. Education on transfusion medicine is of fundamental importance for safe and efficient transfusion practices. Deficiencies in medical knowledge of this subject have been found worldwide. The results of this study indicate a possible deficiency in teaching the basics of this specialty. Thus, additional prospective studies to assess the knowledge and practice of transfusion medicine in Brazilian medical schools are warranted, which could prompt a discussion on the importance of offering training in transfusion medicine to medical students.

27524031|t|Advanced interlocking systems to improve heavy - load-bearing characteristics of flexible intramedullary nailing
27524031|a|Flexible intramedullary nailing (FIN) is a minimally invasive and widespread standard method for osteosynthesis of pediatric long bone fractures. In the case of unstable fractures of the lower extremity, interlocking systems need to be used to prevent axial shortening and subsequent perforation of the nail at its insertion site. In the present study, four different screw -fixed interlocking systems for FINs (Hofer TwinPlug with two 3-mm titanium interlocking screws, Hofer FixPlug with 3-mm titanium interlocking screw, Hofer Plug with 3.5-mm titanium interlocking screw, and Hofer Plug with 3-mm titanium interlocking screw) in comparison with the commonly used Ender stainless steel nails (locked with 3.5-mm screw) were experimentally investigated in cadaveric lamb tibiae, regarding their load characteristics and failure modes in the case of heavy loading. The specimens were subjected to sequential axial cyclic loading of 5000 cycles with stepwise increase of the load amplitude until failure. Migration of locking screws and internal damage of bone tissue was quantified by micro-computed tomography (CT) imaging. Ender nails failed on average at a peak load of 800 N, TwinPlugs at 1367 N, FixPlugs at 1222 N, Plugs 3.5mm at 1225 N and Plugs 3.0mm at 971 N. TwinPlugs, FixPlugs, and Plugs 3.5mm failed in a slow manner over several hundred loading cycles, whereas Ender nails and Plugs 3.0mm exhibited abrupt failure without any prior indication. Our results confirm that axial stability of FIN can be further improved by screw -fixed plugs by simultaneously avoiding shortcomings of an eye-locked system, which the Ender nails are. Considering biomechanical results, plug interlocking systems with 3.5-mm screws should be favored over conventional Ender nails and plugs with 3-mm screws.

27524875|t|Surgical Guidance via Multiplexed Molecular Imaging of Fresh Tissues Labeled with SERS -Coded Nanoparticles
27524875|a|The imaging of dysregulated cell-surface receptors (or biomarkers) is a potential means of identifying the presence of cancer with high sensitivity and specificity. However, due to heterogeneities in the expression of protein biomarkers in tumors, molecular imaging technologies should ideally be capable of visualizing a multiplexed panel of cancer biomarkers. Recently, surface-enhanced Raman-scattering (SERS) nanoparticles (NPs) have attracted wide interest due to their potential for sensitive and multiplexed biomarker detection. In this review, we focus on the most recent advances in tumor imaging using SERS -coded NPs. A brief introduction of the structure and optical properties of SERS NPs is provided, followed by a detailed discussion of key imaging issues such as the administration of NPs in tissue (topical versus systemic), the optical configuration and imaging approach of Raman imaging systems, spectral demultiplexing methods for quantifying NP concentrations, and the disambiguation of specific vs. nonspecific sources of contrast through ratiometric imaging of targeted and untargeted (control) NP pairs. Finally, future challenges and directions are briefly outlined.

27526315|t|Expression and methylation in posttraumatic stress disorder and resilience; evidence of a role for odorant receptors
27526315|a|Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common and potentially disabling disorder that develops in 1/5 to 1/3 of people exposed to severe trauma. Twin studies indicate that genetic factors account for at least one third of the variance in the risk for developing PTSD, however, the specific role for genetic factors in the pathogenesis of PTSD is not well understood. We studied genome-wide gene expression and DNA methylation profiles in 12 participants with PTSD and 12 participants who were resilient to similar severity trauma exposure. Close to 4000 genes were differentially expressed with adjusted p<0.05, fold-change >2, with all but 3 upregulated with PTSD. Eight odorant/olfactory receptor related genes were up-regulated with PTSD as well as genes related to immune activation, the Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid A (GABAA) receptor, and vitamin D synthesis. No differences with adjusted significance for DNA methylation were found. We conclude that increased gene expression may play an important role in PTSD and this expression may not be a consequence of DNA methylation. The role of odorant receptor expression warrants independent replication.

27532629|t|Absorption Characteristics of Vertebrate Non - Visual Opsin, Opn3
27532629|a|Most animals possess multiple opsins which sense light for visual and non - visual functions. Here, we show spectral characteristics of non - visual opsins, vertebrate Opn3s, which are widely distributed among vertebrates. We successfully expressed zebrafish Opn3 in mammalian cultured cells and measured its absorption spectrum spectroscopically. When incubated with 11-cis retinal, zebrafish Opn3 formed a blue-sensitive photopigment with an absorption maximum around 465 nm. The Opn3 converts to an all-trans retinal-bearing photoproduct with an absorption spectrum similar to the dark state following brief blue-light irradiation. The photoproduct experienced a remarkable blue-shift, with changes in position of the isosbestic point, during further irradiation. We then used a cAMP - dependent luciferase reporter assay to investigate light - dependent cAMP responses in cultured cells expressing zebrafish, pufferfish, anole and chicken Opn3. The wild type opsins did not produce responses, but cells expressing chimera mutants (WT Opn3s in which the third intracellular loops were replaced with the third intracellular loop of a Gs-coupled jellyfish opsin) displayed light - dependent changes in cAMP. The results suggest that Opn3 is capable of activating G protein(s) in a light - dependent manner. Finally, we used this assay to measure the relative wavelength - dependent response of cells expressing Opn3 chimeras to multiple quantally - matched stimuli. The inferred spectral sensitivity curve of zebrafish Opn3 accurately matched the measured absorption spectrum. We were unable to estimate the spectral sensitivity curve of mouse or anole Opn3, but, like zebrafish Opn3, the chicken and pufferfish Opn3-JiL3 chimeras also formed blue-sensitive pigments. These findings suggest that vertebrate Opn3s may form blue-sensitive G protein-coupled pigments. Further, we suggest that the method described here, combining a cAMP - dependent luciferase reporter assay with chimeric opsins possessing the third intracellular loop of jellyfish opsin, is a versatile approach for estimating absorption spectra of opsins with unknown signaling cascades or for which absorption spectra are difficult to obtain.

27532798|t|Effectiveness of offloading methods in preventing primary diabetic foot ulcers in adults with diabetes: a systematic review
27532798|a|The incidence of foot ulceration related to diabetes is increasing. Many foot care professionals recommend offloading measures as part of management strategies for modulating excess pressure to prevent development of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). These measures may include padding, insoles / orthotic devices and footwear. There is a lack of evidence -based guidance on the effectiveness of the different offloading options for preventing primary ulceration in those with diabetes. To identify, critically appraise and synthesize the best available evidence on methods of offloading to prevent the development, and reduce the risk, of primary foot ulceration in adults with diabetes .The question addressed by the review was: what is the effectiveness of methods of offloading in preventing primary DFUs in adults with diabetes? Adults 18 years and older with diabetes mellitus, regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, duration or type of diabetes, with no history of DFUs and in any clinical setting will be included. Interventions will include all external methods of offloading. All comparators will be considered. Studies that utilize interventions not considered usual practice in the prevention of DFUs will be excluded. The primary outcome will be primary foot ulceration. The secondary outcome will be indications of changes in plantar pressure. This review will consider all quantitative study designs. A three-step strategy for published and unpublished literature will be used. Fourteen databases will be searched for studies in English up to November 2013. The JBI-MAStARI extraction tool was used to extract relevant data. Results were summarized using narrative and tables. Three studies which examined the effectiveness of four different offloading interventions met the inclusion criteria. There is limited evidence that use of a footwear system (prototype shoe plus polyurethane or cork insole) may prevent a break in the skin; use of customized rigid orthotic devices may contribute to a reduction in the grade and number of calluses; and a manufactured shoe plus customized insole may reduce plantar pressure and therefore reduce the potential risk of skin ulceration. There is limited and low-quality evidence that in a population of adults with diabetes with no history of DFU, the use of footwear with customized or prefabricated orthotic devices may provide some reduction in plantar pressure and therefore help to prevent a primary DFU. There is a lack of evidence on the relative effectiveness of different offloading options.

27534567|t|Punch injury self-harm in young people
27534567|a|Punch injuries are a form of self-harm characterised by the intentional act of striking an object with a closed fist. We aimed to describe the characteristics and trends in young people presenting with injuries sustained via the punch mechanism. A comprehensive retrospective review of medical records was completed of all young people aged 10-18 years presenting to our Central London Emergency Department over a 12-month period. A subset of the total group was identified as the punch injury subgroup. A total of 78 punch injury presentations were identified. In this subgroup, the male: female ratio is 4.57:1; 37.18% of presentations were associated with a fracture (n = 29) and 35.90% (n = 28) of patients re-presented following another punch injury, as a victim of violence, or by other psychiatric presentation. In conclusion, a male preponderance was observed, with frequent re-presentations, often in high-risk circumstances. An opportunity for screening, including mental health, social and substance misuse, was identified. Further research is needed to enable targeted effective interventions in this group.

27537689|t|Delayed Recognition of Deterioration of Patients in General Wards Is Mostly Caused by Human Related Monitoring Failures: A Root Cause Analysis of Unplanned ICU Admissions
27537689|a|An unplanned ICU admission of an inpatient is a serious adverse event (SAE). So far, no in depth-study has been performed to systematically analyse the root causes of unplanned ICU-admissions. The primary aim of this study was to identify the healthcare worker -, organisational -, technical ,- disease - and patient - related causes that contribute to acute unplanned ICU admissions from general wards using a Root-Cause Analysis Tool called PRISMA-medical. Although a Track and Trigger System (MEWS) was introduced in our hospital a few years ago, it was implemented without a clear protocol. Therefore, the secondary aim was to assess the adherence to a Track and Trigger system to identify deterioration on general hospital wards in patients eventually transferred to the ICU. Retrospective observational study in 49 consecutive adult patients acutely admitted to the Intensive Care Unit from a general nursing ward. 1. PRISMA-analysis on root causes of unplanned ICU admissions 2. Assessment of protocol adherence to the early warning score system. Out of 49 cases, 156 root causes were identified. The most frequent root causes were healthcare worker related (46%), which were mainly failures in monitoring the patient. They were followed by disease -related (45%), patient -related causes (7, 5%), and organisational root causes (3%). In only 40% of the patients vital parameters were monitored as was instructed by the doctor. 477 vital parameter sets were found in the 48 hours before ICU admission, in only 1% a correct MEWS was explicitly documented in the record. This in-depth analysis demonstrates that almost half of the unplanned ICU admissions from the general ward had healthcare worker related root causes, mostly due to monitoring failures in clinically deteriorating patients. In order to reduce unplanned ICU admissions, improving the monitoring of patients is therefore warranted.

27539962|t|Effects of a novel phosphodiesterase 10A inhibitor in non-human primates: A therapeutic approach for schizophrenia with improved side effect profile
27539962|a|Schizophrenia symptoms are associated with alterations in basal ganglia-cortical networks that include the cyclic nucleotides (cAMP / cGMP) signaling pathways. Phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) inhibitors have been considered as therapeutic agents for schizophrenia because the regulation of cAMP and cGMP in the striatum by PDE10A plays an important role in the signaling mechanisms of the striatal-cortical network, and thereby in cognitive function. In the present study we assessed in non-human primates (NHPs) the effects of a novel PDE10A inhibitor (FRM-6308) that has demonstrated high potency and selectivity for human recombinant PDE10A in vitro. The behavioral effects of FRM-6308 in a dose range were determined in rhesus monkeys using a standardized motor disability scale for primates, motor tasks, and the " drug effects on the nervous system" (DENS) scale. The neuronal metabolic effects of FRM-6308 were determined with [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose PET imaging. Results showed that FRM-6308 did not have any specific effects on the motor system at s.c. doses up to 0.32 mg/kg in NHPs, which induced a significant increase in the FDG - SUV in striatum (F 16.069, p < 0.05) and cortical (F 15.181, p < 0.05) regions. Higher doses induced sedation and occasional involuntary movements with clear development of tolerance after repeated exposures. These findings suggest that FRM-6308 has the adequate pharmacological profile to advance testing in clinical trials and demonstrate antipsychotic efficacy of PDE10A inhibition for the treatment of schizophrenia patients.

27541815|t|Agglomeration of Luminescent Porous Silicon Nanoparticles in Colloidal Solutions
27541815|a|We have prepared colloidal solutions of clusters composed from porous silicon nanoparticles in methanol, water and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Even if the size of the nanoclusters is between 60 and 500 nm, due to their highly porous "cauliflower"-like structure, the porous silicon nanoparticles are composed of interconnected nanocrystals having around 2.5 nm in size and showing strong visible luminescence in the orange - red spectral region (centred at 600-700 nm). Hydrophilic behaviour and good solubility of the nanoclusters in water and water - based solutions were obtained by adding hydrogen peroxide into the etching solution during preparation and 16 min long after-bath in hydrogen peroxide. By simple filtration of the solutions with syringe filters, we have extracted smaller nanoclusters with sizes of approx. 60-70 nm; however, these nanoclusters in water and PBS solution (pH neutral) are prone to agglomeration, as was confirmed by zeta potential measurements. When the samples were left at ambient conditions for several weeks, the typical nanocluster size increased to approx. 330-400 nm and then remained stable. However, both freshly filtered and aged samples (with agglomerated porous silicon nanoparticles) of porous silicon in water and PBS solutions can be further used for biological studies or as luminescent markers in living cells.

27542694|t|Development of a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method for quantitative analysis of trace d-amino acids
27542694|a|d-Amino acids have recently attracted much attention in various research fields including medical, clinical and food industry due to their important biological functions that differ from l-amino acid. Most chiral amino acid separation techniques require complicated derivatization procedures in order to achieve the desirable chromatographic behavior and detectability. Thus, the aim of this research is to develop a highly sensitive analytical method for the enantioseparation of chiral amino acids without any derivatization process using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). By optimizing MS/MS parameters, we established a quantification method that allowed the simultaneous analysis of 18 d-amino acids with high sensitivity and reproducibility. Additionally, we applied the method to food sample (vinegar) for the validation, and successfully quantified trace levels of d-amino acids in samples. These results demonstrated the applicability and feasibility of the LC-MS/MS method as a novel, effective tool for d-amino acid measurement in various biological samples.

27542782|t|The Multi-center Evaluation of the Accuracy of the Contrast MEdium INduced Pd/Pa RaTiO in Predicting FFR (MEMENTO - FFR) Study
27542782|a|Adenosine administration is needed for the achievement of maximal hyperaemia fractional flow reserve (FFR) assessment. The objective was to test the accuracy of Pd / Pa ratio registered during submaximal hyperaemia induced by non-ionic contrast medium (contrast FFR [cFFR]) in predicting FFR and comparing it to the performance of resting Pd / Pa in a collaborative registry of 926 patients enrolled in 10 hospitals from four European countries (Italy, Spain, France and Portugal). Resting Pd / Pa, cFFR and FFR were measured in 1,026 coronary stenoses functionally evaluated using commercially available pressure wires. cFFR was obtained after intracoronary injection of contrast medium, while FFR was measured after administration of adenosine. Resting Pd / Pa and cFFR were significantly higher than FFR (0.93±0.05 vs. 0.87±0.08 vs. 0.84±0.08, p<0.001). A strong correlation and a close agreement at Bland-Altman analysis between cFFR and FFR were observed (r=0.90, p<0.001 and 95% CI of disagreement: from -0.042 to 0.11). ROC curve analysis showed an excellent accuracy (89%) of the cFFR cut-off of ≤0.85 in predicting an FFR value ≤0.80 (AUC 0.95 [95% CI: 0.94-0.96]), significantly better than that observed using resting Pd / Pa (AUC: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.88-0.91; p<0.001). A cFFR / FFR hybrid approach showed a significantly lower number of lesions requiring adenosine than a resting Pd / Pa / FFR hybrid approach (22% vs. 44%, p<0.0001). cFFR is accurate in predicting the functional significance of coronary stenosis. This could allow limiting the use of adenosine to obtain FFR to a minority of stenoses with considerable savings of time and costs.

27542789|t|Transfemoral aortic valve implantation with the repositionable Lotus valve for treatment of patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis: results from a single-centre experience
27542789|a|The aim of the study was to evaluate the procedural and 30- day results for the repositionable Lotus valve in patients undergoing transfemoral aortic valve implantation in a single-centre experience. We prospectively enrolled 110 patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (NCT02162069). All procedures were performed without general anaesthesia by the transfemoral approach. Patients were followed for 30 days. Patients received the 23 mm (n=20), 25 mm (n=43) or 27 mm (n=47) Lotus device. Mean oversizing in relation to annulus or left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) did not differ among groups. There was no residual moderate or severe aortic regurgitation. The rate of mild aortic regurgitation was low at 9.1%. There was no valve embolisation, no need for a second valve and no conversion to surgery. The need for a new pacemaker implantation due to complete (third degree) or type II (Mobitz) second degree atrioventricular block was 24.1%, excluding patients with previously implanted devices. Within 30 days the rates of all-cause mortalit y and stroke were low. In patients with severe aortic stenosis, transfemoral TAVI with the repositionable Lotus valve was associated with a high rate of device success, no moderate or severe residual aortic regurgitation, low rates of major vascular complications and mortality within 30 days.

27542814|t|A Comparison Between Measured Concentration of 3H in Kalpakkam Environment with Predicted Atmospheric Dispersion Model
27542814|a|The field measurements of 3H in the form of HTO present in air moisture carried out around Madras Atomic Power Station were compared with predicted values using atmospheric dispersion modeling. Air 3H samples were collected from different sectors at the site boundary of the operating reactors for the period of 2 y and compared with Gaussian Plume model. The predictions were comparable with the measured value. The slight variation observed between the two methods is attributed to the uncertainty involved in the measurement of air 3H concentration and in the measurement of site-specific meteorological parameters. The radiation dose imparted to members of public due to the levels observed is well within station technical specification limit for 3H.

27543814|t|The four-component aureocin A70 as a promising agent for food biopreservation
27543814|a|Aureocin A70 is the only four-component bacteriocin described to date. As it inhibits the growth of a wide range of Gram-positive bacteria, including Listeria monocytogenes strains isolated from food, its potential for improving food safety was investigated in this study. Aureocin A70 (10,240AU/mL) proved to be bactericidal, but not extensively lytic, against listerial strains. The antibacterial activity of aureocin A70 (16AU/mL) was then tested in UHT-treated skimmed milk inoculated with the food -associated L. monocytogenes L12 strain (4-log CFU/mL) during storage at 4°C for one week. Aureocin A70 caused a time-dependent reduction in the listerial viable cell counts (5.51-log units) up to 7days of incubation. Aureocin A70 was neither toxic to the Vero and the L-929 cell lines nor exhibited a hemolytic activity against sheep red blood cells. Aureocin A70 proved to be completely stable for one month at 25°C, 16weeks at 4°C and 20weeks at -20°C. Aureocin A70 exhibited a time-dependent susceptibility to simulated gastric juice and bile salts mimicking gastrointestinal conditions. The entrapment of aureocin A70 in an alginate / gelatin matrix revealed that this bacteriocin can be released from this matrix. Moreover, it remained adsorbed to and active on a low-density polyethylene plastic surface suggesting that aureocin A70 may be employed in bioactive packaging to control the growth of undesirable bacteria. Taken together these results suggest that aureocin A70 is a promising alternative to be used in food applications.

27544926|t|Folate - conjugated gene - carrying microbubbles with focused ultrasound for concurrent blood-brain barrier opening and local gene delivery
27544926|a|Previous studies have demonstrated that circulating DNA - encapsulated microbubbles (MBs) combined with focused ultrasound (FUS) can be used for local blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening and gene delivery. However, few studies focused on how to increase the efficiency of gene delivery to brain tumors after the released gene penetrating the BBB. Here, we proposed the use of folate - conjugated DNA - loaded cationic MBs (FCMBs). When combined with FUS as a trigger for BBB opening, FCMBs were converted into nanometer - sized vesicles that were transported to the brain parenchyma. The FCMBs can selectively aggregate around tumor cells that overexpressed the folate receptor, thus enhancing gene delivery via folate - stimulated endocytosis. Our results confirmed that FCMBs can carry DNA on the surface of the MB shell and have good targeting ability on C6 glioma cells. In addition, the optimized FUS parameters for FCMBs - enhanced gene delivery were confirmed by cell experiments (center frequency = 1 MHz; acoustic pressure = 700 kPa; pulse repetition frequency = 5 Hz; cycle number = 10000; exposure time = 1 min; FCMBs concentration = 4 × 10(7) MB/mL). In vivo data also indicated that FCMBs show better gene transfection efficiency than MBs without folate conjugation and the traditional approach of directly injecting the gene. This study described our novel development of multifunctional MBs for FUS - triggered gene delivery / therapy.

27550416|t|Modulation of IL-6 induced RANKL expression in arthritic synovium by a transcription factor SOX5
27550416|a|Receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) is critically involved in bone erosion of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We previously reported association between younger age at onset of RA and a RANKL promoter SNP that conferred an elevated promoter activity via binding to a transcription factor SOX5. Here we study the regulation of SOX5 levels in relation to RANKL expression in RA synovial fibroblasts (SF) and the development of bone erosion in the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse. Our data indicated SOX5 levels were higher in synovium and synovial fluid from RA compared to osteoarthritis patients. Pro-inflammatory cytokines upregulated SOX5 and RANKL expression in both primary RA SF and the rheumatoid synovial fibroblast cell line, MH7A. Overexpression of SOX5 resulted in significantly increased RANKL levels, while knockdown of SOX5 resulted in diminished IL-6 mediated RANKL upregulation in MH7A cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) showed approximately 3-fold enrichment of RANKL-specific DNA in anti-SOX5 immunoprecipitate in IL-6 treated MH7A cells as compared to untreated cells. Locally silencing SOX5 gene significantly diminished RANKL positive cells and bone erosion in CIA mice. These findings suggest SOX5 is an important regulator of IL-6 - induced RANKL expression in RA SF.

27553051|t|Intracameral cefuroxime in the prevention of postoperative endophthalmitis: an experience from Hong Kong
27553051|a|The purpose was to study the effect of introducing intracameral cefuroxime, which was compounded by a hospital pharmacy, on postoperative endophthalmitis in a tertiary eye centre in Hong Kong. All cases that underwent cataract surgeries over a 12-year period (January 2004 to December 2015) were included. The routine use of intracameral cefuroxime at the end of cataract surgery was introduced at our centre after April 2010. All cefuroxime aliquots were prepared by the hospital pharmacy using an aseptic compounding technique. The rates of postoperative endophthalmitis before April 2010 (Group 1, no intracameral cefuroxime) and after April 2010 (Group 2, routine use of intracameral cefuroxime) were compared. A total of 30,428 eyes (7,332 in Group 1 and 23,096 in Group 2) were studied. Eight cases developed postoperative endophthalmitis (1.09 in 1000; 0.11 %) in Group 1 whereas no cases developed endophthalmitis (0 %) in Group 2. The rate of reduction was statistically significant (p < 0.0001). Seven out of eight cases of endophthalmitis were confirmed by positive culture. Organisms identified were Group G Streptococcus (two cases), Group B Streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, Serratia marcescens, and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (two cases). Antibiotic susceptibility testing results were available in six cases. Four out of six organisms were susceptible to the penicillin group. No adverse events related to the use of intracameral cefuroxime were encountered. The use of intracameral cefuroxime could significantly reduce the rate of postoperative endophthalmitis in a tertiary centre in Hong Kong. The use of aseptic compounding to prepare cefuroxime aliquots by hospital pharmacy appeared to be safe and efficacious.

27554917|t|A standardized approach for the assessment and treatment of internationally adopted children with a previously repaired anorectal malformation (ARM)
27554917|a|A significant number of internationally adopted children have congenital birth defects. As a specialist center for colorectal diagnoses, we evaluate such children with an anorectal malformation (ARM) and have found that a significant number need a reoperation. Knowledge of the common complications following ARM surgery has led us to develop treatment algorithms for patients with unknown past medical and surgical history, a situation typically encountered in the adopted population. The results of investigations, indications, and rate of reoperation were assessed for adopted children with an ARM evaluated between 2014 and 2016. 56 patients (28 males) were identified. 76.8% required reoperative surgery. Mislocation of the anus outside the sphincter complex was seen in 50% of males and 39.3% of females. Anal stricture, rectal prolapse, retained vaginal septum, and a strictured vaginal introitus were also common. The reoperative surgery rate in the internationally adopted child with an ARM is high. Complete, systematic evaluation of these children is required to identify complications following initial repair. Development of mechanisms to improve the primary surgical care these children receive is needed.

27558793|t|Highly fluorescent gold nanoclusters stabilized by food proteins: From preparation to application in detection of food contaminants and bioactive nutrients
27558793|a|Applications of nanotechnology in food have rapidly increased in the past decades. Ultra-small gold nanoclusters (Au NCs), composed of several to roughly a hundred atoms, represent a kind of novel nanomaterials. The Au NCs directed by food proteins have drawn considerable research attention due to their environmentally friendly preparation, strong fluorescence, excellent photo-stability and favorable biocompatibility. These interesting protein-Au hybrids have opened up a new area at the nano-bio-food interface, not only did they provide the missing link between single metal atoms and plasmonic metal nanoparticles, but also developed the hybrid system between biomacromolecule and inorganic ions. In this review, we highlighted the synthesis strategies and optical properties of the Au NCs stabilized by typical food proteins as well as their applications in detection of food contaminants or bioactive nutrients. In addition, we discussed current challenges and future development in food proteins directed gold nanoclusters for size-controlled synthesis and multifunctional applications.

27562025|t|Sub-lethal effects of dietary neonicotinoid insecticide exposure on honey bee queen fecundity and colony development
27562025|a|Many factors can negatively affect honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) health including the pervasive use of systemic neonicotinoid insecticides. Through direct consumption of contaminated nectar and pollen from treated plants, neonicotinoids can affect foraging, learning, and memory in worker bees. Less well studied are the potential effects of neonicotinoids on queen bees, which may be exposed indirectly through trophallaxis, or food - sharing. To assess effects on queen productivity, small colonies of different sizes (1500, 3000, and 7000 bees) were fed imidacloprid (0, 10, 20, 50, and 100 ppb) in syrup for three weeks. We found adverse effects of imidacloprid on queens (egg-laying and locomotor activity), worker bees (foraging and hygienic activities), and colony development (brood production and pollen stores) in all treated colonies. Some effects were less evident as colony size increased, suggesting that larger colony populations may act as a buffer to pesticide exposure. This study is the first to show adverse effects of imidacloprid on queen bee fecundity and behavior and improves our understanding of how neonicotinoids may impair short-term colony functioning. These data indicate that risk-mitigation efforts should focus on reducing neonicotinoid exposure in the early spring when colonies are smallest and queens are most vulnerable to exposure.

27562951|t|Therapeutic applications of CRISPR RNA-guided genome editing
27562951|a|The rapid development of programmable nuclease -based genome editing technologies has enabled targeted gene disruption and correction both in vitro and in vivo This revolution opens up the possibility of precise genome editing at target genomic sites to modulate gene function in animals and plants. Among several programmable nucleases, the type II clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)- CRISPR-associated nuclease 9 (Cas9) system has progressed remarkably in recent years, leading to its widespread use in research, medicine and biotechnology. In particular, CRISPR-Cas9 shows highly efficient gene editing activity for therapeutic purposes in systems ranging from patient stem cells to animal models. However, the development of therapeutic approaches and delivery methods remains a great challenge for biomedical applications. Herein, we review therapeutic applications that use the CRISPR-Cas9 system and discuss the possibilities and challenges ahead.

27563235|t|Design and characteristics of cytotoxic fibroblast growth factor 1 conjugate for fibroblast growth factor receptor - targeted cancer therapy
27563235|a|Fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) are attractive candidate cancer therapy targets as they are overexpressed in multiple types of tumors, such as breast, prostate, bladder, and lung cancer. In this study, a natural ligand of FGFR, an engineered variant of fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1V), was conjugated to a potent cytotoxic drug, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), and used as a targeting agent for cancer cells overexpressing FGFRs, similar to antibodies in antibody-drug conjugates. The FGF1V-valine-citrulline-MMAE conjugate showed a favorable stability profile, bound FGFRs on the cell surface specifically, and efficiently released the drug (MMAE) upon cleavage by the lysosomal protease cathepsin B. Importantly, the conjugate showed a prominent cytotoxic effect toward cell lines expressing FGFR. FGF1V-vcMMAE was highly cytotoxic at concentrations even an order of magnitude lower than those found for free MMAE. This effect was FGFR -specific as cells lacking FGFR did not show any increased mortality.

27565311|t|Effects of morphology and surface hydroxyl on the toxicity of BiOCl in human HaCaT cells
27565311|a|Recently, bismuth oxychloride nanomaterials (BiOCls) are showing great promise in pollutant removal. Residues from these environmental remediations are potential hazardous materials. Unfortunately, human health risks of BiOCls are still unexplored widely. In the present study, we focused on the influence of physicochemical properties on the cytotoxicity of BiOCls toward a human skin derived cell line (HaCaT). Results showed that morphology and surface hydroxyl both had a profound effect on the toxicity of BiOCls. Microsphere-shaped BiOCl caused less toxicity than nanosheet-shaped BiOCl because of weaker particle-membrane interactions, while the presence of surface hydroxyl on microsphere-shaped BiOCl significantly raised the toxicity owing to the increased interaction with cell membrane. Both microsphere-shaped BiOCl with surface hydroxyl and nanosheet-shaped BiOCl caused significant cell membrane damage (PI uptake and LDH release), however, based on the different mechanism. The former may be a predominant "chemical" mechanism involved an oxidative stress paradigm, as manifested by elevated ROS and depleted GSH, while the latter is mainly due to a direct " physical " damage to cell membrane. Both " physical " and "chemical" response led to cell death. Furthermore, a set of experiments including MMP collapse, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis / necrosis were conducted to propose a scenario for toxicological aspects of BiOCls. Data presented here would help to enable the rational design of BiOCls for either reducing their unintended consequences or increasing their application potentials.

27566296|t|Reduced haemodynamic coupling and exercise are associated with vascular stiffening in pulmonary arterial hypertension
27566296|a|Inadequate right ventricular (RV) and pulmonary arterial (PA) functional responses to exercise are important yet poorly understood features of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). This study combined invasive catheterisation with echocardiography to assess RV afterload, RV function and ventricular - vascular coupling in subjects with PAH. Twenty-six subjects with PAH were prospectively recruited to undergo right heart catheterisation and Doppler echocardiography at rest and during incremental exercise, and cardiac MRI at rest. Measurements at rest included basic haemodynamics, RV function and coupling efficiency (η). Measurements during incremental exercise included pulmonary vascular resistance (Z0), characteristic impedance (ZC, a measure of proximal PA stiffness) and proximal and distal PA compliance (CPA). In patients with PAH, the proximal PAs were significantly stiffer at maximum exercise (ZC =2.31±0.38 vs 1.33±0.15 WU×m(2) at rest; p=0.003) and PA compliance was decreased (CPA =0.88±0.10 vs 1.32±0.17 mL/mm Hg/m(2) at rest; p=0.0002). Z0 did not change with exercise. As a result, the resistance-compliance (RC) time decreased with exercise (0.67±0.05 vs 1.00±0.07 s at rest; p<10(-6)). When patients were grouped according to resting coupling efficiency, those with poorer η exhibited stiffer proximal PAs at rest, a lower maximum exercise level, and more limited CPA reduction at maximum exercise. In PAH, exercise causes proximal and distal PA stiffening, which combined with preserved Z0 results in decreased RC time with exercise. Stiff PAs at rest may also contribute to poor haemodynamic coupling, reflecting reduced pulmonary vascular reserve that contributes to limit the maximum exercise level tolerated.

27566564|t|Altered pH gradient at the plasma membrane of osteosarcoma cells is a key mechanism of drug resistance
27566564|a|Current therapy of osteosarcoma (OS), the most common primary bone malignancy, is based on a combination of surgery and chemotherapy. Multidrug resistance mediated by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) overexpression has been previously associated with treatment failure and progression of OS, although other mechanisms may also play a role. We considered the typical acidic extracellular pH (pHe) of sarcomas, and found that doxorubicin (DXR) cytotoxicity is reduced in P-gp negative OS cells cultured at pHe 6.5 compared to standard 7.4. Short-time (24-48 hours) exposure to low pHe significantly increased the number and acidity of lysosomes, and the combination of DXR with omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor targeting lysosomal acidity, significantly enhanced DXR cytotoxicity. In OS xenografts, the combination treatment of DXR and omeprazole significantly reduced tumor volume and body weight loss. The impaired toxicity of DXR at low pHe was not associated with increased autophagy or lysosomal acidification, but rather, as shown by SNARF staining, with a reversal of the pH gradient at the plasma membrane (ΔpHcm), eventually leading to a reduced DXR intracellular accumulation. Finally, the reversal of ΔpHcm in OS cells promoted resistance not only to DXR, but also to cisplatin and methotrexate, and, to a lesser extent, to vincristine. Altogether, our findings show that, in OS cells, short-term acidosis induces resistance to different chemotherapeutic drugs by a reversal of ΔpHcm, suggesting that buffer therapies or regimens including proton pump inhibitors in combination to low concentrations of conventional anticancer agents may offer novel solutions to overcome drug resistance.

27566854|t|Boston Keratoprosthesis Type 1: A Randomized Controlled Trial of Fresh versus Frozen Corneal Donor Carriers with Long-Term Follow-up
27566854|a|To compare the long-term clinical outcomes of fresh versus frozen corneal graft carriers for the Boston Keratoprosthesis type 1 (B-KPro). Prospective, single-center, nonblinded, randomized controlled trial. All participants were followed through the initial study protocol of 24 months and were approached to enter an extension phase, with continuing follow-up visits to 60 months. All patients undergoing B-KPro surgery between October 2008 and December 2009 by a single experienced surgeon at the Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal using an allograft carrier were considered. Patients were excluded if they had previously undergone B-KPro implantation. Participants were randomized individually to receive a B-KPro using a frozen or a fresh corneal graft carrier on the basis of tissue availability on the day of surgery, as determined by the local eye bank. The primary outcome measure was device retention at 24 and 60 months. Secondary outcome measures included surgical feasibility, visual acuity (VA), and complications. Thirty-seven eyes of 37 patients were enrolled in the initial study protocol, with 19 eyes randomized to fresh and 18 to frozen carrier grafts. Thirty-six eyes were followed through to 24 months, with 1 lost to follow-up. Of these, 26 were enrolled in the extension (11 eyes with a frozen and 15 eyes with a fresh carrier graft). There were no differences in the baseline characteristics of patients enrolled in the extension phase versus those who were not. At 60 months, median corrected distance VA) in the fresh group had improved to 20/150 from a baseline of counting fingers, whereas the frozen group improved to 20/400 from a baseline of hand motions. Device retention was 100% at 24 months and 96% at 60 months. There were no significant differences in the rate of complications between groups. Fresh and frozen corneal donors offer similar clinical outcomes when used as carriers for the B-KPro, with no significant differences in device retention, visual rehabilitation, or rates of complications at 24 or 60 months.

27567148|t|Impact of an Educational Intervention to Improve Antibiotic Prescribing for Nurse Practitioners in a Pediatric Urgent Care Center
27567148|a|Up to 21% of pediatric visits result in an antibiotic prescription, and a large portion of these are unnecessary. To determine if educational sessions would reduce inappropriate antibiotic use. Intervention study evaluating antibiotic prescribing following educational sessions for urinary tract infection, skin and soft tissue infection, pharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, acute otitis media, and acute bacterial sinusitis. A total of 26 out of 43 (60%) nurse practitioners in 4 urgent care centers were enrolled in the study. The rate of inappropriate antibiotic use among all conditions was 10% before and 8% after the intervention (p = .02). A decrease in inappropriate antibiotic prescribing was seen after the educational session (p < .01). The most common reasons for inappropriate antibiotic prescribing were too broad (41%), wrong dosage (22%), and not indicated (17%). Educational sessions led to improvement in overall inappropriate antibiotic use. Additional stewardship interventions are needed to further reduce unnecessary antibiotic use.

27568284|t|Zika Virus Disrupts Phospho-TBK1 Localization and Mitosis in Human Neuroepithelial Stem Cells and Radial Glia
27568284|a|The mechanisms underlying Zika virus (ZIKV)-related microcephaly and other neurodevelopment defects remain poorly understood. Here, we describe the derivation and characterization, including single-cell RNA-seq, of neocortical and spinal cord neuroepithelial stem (NES) cells to model early human neurodevelopment and ZIKV -related neuropathogenesis. By analyzing human NES cells, organotypic fetal brain slices, and a ZIKV - infected micrencephalic brain, we show that ZIKV infects both neocortical and spinal NES cells as well as their fetal homolog, radial glial cells (RGCs), causing disrupted mitoses, supernumerary centrosomes, structural disorganization, and cell death. ZIKV infection of NES cells and RGCs causes centrosomal depletion and mitochondrial sequestration of phospho-TBK1 during mitosis. We also found that nucleoside analogs inhibit ZIKV replication in NES cells, protecting them from ZIKV - induced pTBK1 relocalization and cell death. We established a model system of human neural stem cells to reveal cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental defects associated with ZIKV infection and its potential treatment.

27569088|t|Prevalence of HPV genotypes in cervical adenocarcinoma: a study in Greek women
27569088|a|To study the prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes among cervical adenocarcinomas in Greek women. The study group comprised 78 adenocarcinoma cases (20 in situ and 58 invasive). HPV DNA was amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and HPV genotypes were identified by reverse hybridization. There was a high prevalence of HPV infection both for in situ (95%) or invasive (94.83%) adenocarcinomas, comprising also cancers of unusual morphology. HPV 16 was the commonest strain (N=57, 73.08%) followed by HPV 18 (N=28, 35.90%). Interestingly, 13 cases (16.67%) were also HPV 52 positive (as co-infection with HPV 16 or 18). All other strains with the exception of HPV 66 were found only as co-infections. No significant age difference was noted in terms of any HPV strain positivity. HPV DNA was found in the large majority of cervical adenocarcinomas. As opposed to other studies, HPV 52 was the third most commonly encountered strain after HPV 16 and HPV 18. The above findings would probably be of help in decision making concerning vaccination policy for the prevention of HPV infection in Greece.

27570111|t|Glucose metabolism - weighted imaging with chemical exchange-sensitive MRI of 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) in brain: Sensitivity and biological sources
27570111|a|Recent proof-of-principle studies have demonstrated the feasibility of measuring the uptake and metabolism of non-labeled 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) by a chemical exchange-sensitive spin-lock (CESL) MRI approach. In order to gain better understanding of this new approach, we performed dynamic in vivo CESL MRI on healthy rat brains with an intravenous injection of 2DG under various conditions at 9.4T. For three 2DG doses of 0.25, 0.5 and 1g/kg, we found that 2DG - CESL signals increased linearly with injection dose at the initial (<20min) but not the later period (>40min) suggesting time-dependent differential weightings of 2DG transport and metabolism. Remaining 2DG - CESL studies were performed with 0.25g/kg 2DG. Since a higher isoflurane level reduces glucose metabolism and increases blood flow, 2DG - CESL was measured under 0.5%, 1.5% and 2.2% isoflurane. The 2DG - CESL signal was reduced at higher isoflurane levels correlating well with the 2DG phosphorylation in the intracellular space. To detect regional heterogeneities of glucose metabolism, 2DG - CESL with 0.33×0.33×1.50mm(3) resolution was obtained, which indeed showed a higher response in the cortex compared to the corpus callosum. Lastly, unlike CESL MRI with the injection of non-transportable mannitol, the 2DG - CESL response decreased with an increased spin-lock pulse power confirming that 2DG - CESL is dominated by chemical exchange processes in the extravascular space. Taken together, our results showed that 2DG - CESL MRI signals mainly indicate glucose transport and metabolism and may be a useful biomarker for metabolic studies of normal and diseased brains.

27570362|t|Parental perceptions of children´s agency: Parental warmth, school achievement and adjustment
27570362|a|The present study examined Swedish mothers' and fathers' warmth towards their children in relation to their children´s agency. It also examined the longitudinal relation between agency and children's externalizing, internalizing, and school achievement. Swedish children's mothers and fathers (N = 103) were interviewed at three time points (when children were 8, 9, and 10 years old) about their warmth towards their children, children's agency, and children's externalizing and internalizing behaviors and school achievement. Parental warmth at Time 1 was significantly correlated with child agency at Time 2, which was significantly correlated with child externalizing and internalizing behaviors and academic achievement at Time 3. There were no differences between girls and boys. Results from this study indicate that Swedish parents' warmth is directly related to subsequent perceptions of children's agency, which in turn are related to subsequently lower child externalizing and internalizing problems and higher academic achievement. These findings held in the context of a three- year longitudinal study and for both boys and girls, suggesting the importance of child agency in the link between parental warmth and children's adjustment.

27571215|t|Vasopressin regulates the growth of the biliary epithelium in polycystic liver disease
27571215|a|The neurohypophysial hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) acts by three distinct receptor subtypes: V1a, V1b, and V2. In the liver, AVP is involved in ureogenesis, glycogenolysis, neoglucogenesis and regeneration. No data exist about the presence of AVP in the biliary epithelium. Cholangiocytes are the target cells in a number of animal models of cholestasis, including bile duct ligation (BDL), and in several human pathologies, such as polycystic liver disease characterized by the presence of cysts that bud from the biliary epithelium. In vivo, liver fragments from normal and BDL mice and rats as well as liver samples from normal and ADPKD patients were collected to evaluate: (i) intrahepatic bile duct mass by immunohistochemistry for cytokeratin-19; and (ii) expression of V1a, V1b and V2 by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and real-time PCR. In vitro, small and large mouse cholangiocytes, H69 (non-malignant human cholangiocytes) and LCDE (human cholangiocytes from the cystic epithelium) were stimulated with vasopressin in the absence/ presence of AVP antagonists such as OPC-31260 and Tolvaptan, before assessing cellular growth by MTT assay and cAMP levels. Cholangiocytes express V2 receptor that was upregulated following BDL and in ADPKD liver samples. Administration of AVP increased proliferation and cAMP levels of small cholangiocytes and LCDE cells. We found no effect in the proliferation of large mouse cholangiocytes and H69 cells. Increases were blocked by preincubation with the AVP antagonists. These results showed that AVP and its receptors may be important in the modulation of the proliferation rate of the biliary epithelium.

27571223|t|Central Corneal Thickness Reproducibility among Ten Different Instruments
27571223|a|To assess agreement between one ultrasonic (US) and nine optical instruments for the measurement of central corneal thickness (CCT), and to evaluate intra- and inter-operator reproducibility. In this observational cross-sectional study, two masked operators measured CCT thickness twice in 28 healthy eyes. We used seven spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) devices, one time-domain OCT, one Scheimpflug camera, and one US-based instrument. Inter- and intra-operator reproducibility was evaluated by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), coefficient of variation (CV), and Bland-Altman test analysis. Instrument -to- instrument reproducibility was determined by ANOVA for repeated measurements. We also tested how the devices disagreed regarding systemic bias and random error using a structural equation model. Mean CCT of all instruments ranged from 536 ± 42 μm to 577 ± 40 μm. An instrument -to- instrument correlation test showed high values among the 10 investigated devices (correlation coefficient range 0.852-0.995; p values <0.0001 in all cases). The highest correlation coefficient values were registered between 3D OCT-2000 Topcon-Spectral OCT/SLO Opko (0.995) and Cirrus HD-OCT Zeiss-RS-3000 Nidek (0.995), whereas the lowest were seen between SS-1000 CASIA and Spectral OCT/SLO Opko (0.852). ICC and CV showed excellent inter- and intra-operator reproducibility for all optic -based devices, except for the US -based device. Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated low mean biases between operators. Despite highlighting good intra- and inter-operator reproducibility, we found that a scale bias between instruments might interfere with thorough CCT monitoring. We suggest that optimal monitoring is achieved with the same operator and the same device.

27571883|t|Predictors of neurologic and nonneurologic death in patients with brain metastasis initially treated with upfront stereotactic radiosurgery without whole-brain radiation therapy
27571883|a|In this study we attempted to discern the factors predictive of neurologic death in patients with brain metastasis treated with upfront stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) without whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) while accounting for the competing risk of nonneurologic death. We performed a retrospective single-institution analysis of patients with brain metastasis treated with upfront SRS without WBRT. Competing risks analysis was performed to estimate the subdistribution hazard ratios (HRs) for neurologic and nonneurologic death for predictor variables of interest. Of 738 patients treated with upfront SRS alone, neurologic death occurred in 226 (30.6%), while nonneurologic death occurred in 309 (41.9%). Multivariate competing risks analysis identified an increased hazard of neurologic death associated with diagnosis-specific graded prognostic assessment (DS-GPA) ≤ 2 (P = .005), melanoma histology (P = .009), and increased number of brain metastases (P<.001), while there was a decreased hazard associated with higher SRS dose (P = .004). Targeted agents were associated with a decreased HR of neurologic death in the first 1.5 years (P = .04) but not afterwards. An increased hazard of nonneurologic death was seen with increasing age (P =.03), nonmelanoma histology (P<.001), presence of extracranial disease (P<.001), and progressive systemic disease (P =.004). Melanoma, DS-GPA, number of brain metastases, and SRS dose are predictive of neurologic death, while age, nonmelanoma histology, and more advanced systemic disease are predictive of nonneurologic death. Targeted agents appear to delay neurologic death.

27572131|t|Pharmacological Actions of Glucagon-Like Peptide-1, Gastric Inhibitory Polypeptide, and Glucagon
27572131|a|Glucagon family of peptide hormones is a group of structurally related brain-gut peptides that exert their pleiotropic actions through interactions with unique members of class B1 G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). They are key regulators of hormonal homeostasis and are important drug targets for metabolic disorders such as type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), obesity, and dysregulations of the nervous systems such as migraine, anxiety, depression, neurodegeneration, psychiatric disorders, and cardiovascular diseases. The current review aims to provide a detailed overview of the current understanding of the pharmacological actions and therapeutic advances of three members within this family including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), and glucagon.

27573109|t|Endemic hydrothermal vent species identified in the open ocean seed bank
27573109|a|Hydrothermal vent systems host microbial communities among which several microorganisms have been considered endemic to this type of habitat. It is still unclear how these organisms colonize geographically distant hydrothermal environments. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, we compare the bacterial communities of sixteen Atlantic hydrothermal vent samples with our own and publicly available global open ocean samples. Analysing sequences obtained from 63 million 16S rRNA genes, the genera we could identify in the open ocean waters contained 99.9% of the vent reads. This suggests that previously observed vent exclusiveness is, in most cases, probably an artefact of lower sequencing depth. These findings are a further step towards elucidating the role of the open ocean as a seed bank. They can explain the predicament of how species expected to be endemic to vent systems are able to colonize geographically distant hydrothermal habitats and contribute to our understanding of whether 'everything is really everywhere'.

27573702|t|Cerebral toxoplasmosis in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome in the neurological emergency department of a tertiary hospital
27573702|a|Cerebral toxoplasmosis is the most common cause of space occupying brain lesion in patients with HIV/AIDS in Brazil. In the post-HAART era, it is responsible for high rates of morbidity and mortality worldwide. This study consists of a case series of 56 patients diagnosed with cerebral toxoplasmosis whose clinical features, brain imaging and cerebrospinal fluid aspects were analyzed. Cerebral toxoplasmosis led to the diagnosis of infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in 27 (48.2%) of the patients, while 29 (51.2%) others already knew to be HIV seropositive. However, at the time of diagnosis of cerebral toxoplasmosis, only 9 (16.6%) reported being under antiretroviral therapy and 5 (8.9%) were receiving primary prophylaxis for toxoplasmosis. Headache, strength deficit and fever were the most frequent signs and symptoms throughout the study. Fifty-three patients showed changes consistent with toxoplasmosis in CT or MRI. Thirty-four (60.7%) CSF samples were positive in the indirect haemagglutination test and for the reaction of Toxoplasma gondii IgG ELISA, while 31 (55.4%) were positive in the direct haemagglutination test. Fifty (89.3%) patients underwent first-line treatment for toxoplasmosis. Cerebral toxoplasmosis is still a very relevant neurological disease in individuals with AIDS admitted to neurology emergency departments. Early diagnosis and initiation of empiric treatment and antiretroviral therapy are important for good prognosis.

27575455|t|Maf1 -mediated regulation of yeast RNA polymerase III is correlated with CCA addition at the 3' end of tRNA precursors
27575455|a|In eukaryotic cells tRNA synthesis is negatively regulated by the protein Maf1, conserved from yeast to humans. Maf1 from yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae mediates repression of trna transcription when cells are transferred from medium with glucose to medium with glycerol, a non-fermentable carbon source. The strain with deleted gene encoding Maf1 (maf1Δ) is viable but accumulates tRNA precursors. In this study tRNA precursors were analysed by RNA-Seq and Northern hybridization in wild type strain and maf1Δ mutant grown in glucose medium or upon shift to repressive conditions. A negative effect of maf1Δ mutant on the addition of the auxiliary CCA nucleotides to the 3' end of pre-tRNAs was observed in cells shifted to unfavourable growth conditions. This effect was reduced by overexpression of the yeast CCA1 gene encoding ATP(CTP):tRNA nucleotidyltransferase. The CCA sequence at the 3' end is important for export of tRNA precursors from the nucleus and essential for tRNA charging with amino acids. Data presented here indicate that CCA-addition to intron -containing end-processed tRNA precursors is a limiting step in tRNA maturation when there is no Maf1 mediated RNA polymerase III (Pol III) repression. The correlation between CCA synthesis and Pol III regulation by Maf1 could be important in coordination of tRNA transcription, processing and regulation of translation.

27575503|t|Pre-existing renal lesions revealed after renal trauma, Difficulties in diagnosis and accountability: About 14 cases
27575503|a|Pre-existing renal lesions (PERL) may interfere with the patho-physiology of trauma, alter the radiographic imaging and influence the therapeutic approach. The aims of this study were to record the PERL found incidentally during blunt renal trauma, to specify the place for effective conservative management and to determin the estimated partial permanent disability (PPD). The medical records of 14 patients with PERL and blunt renal trauma were reviewed. In each patient, pre-existing renal abnormalities, clinical symptoms, CT scan study findings, associated injuries, therapeutic approach, the accountability criteria and the estimated PPD were recorded. There were 11 men and 3 women with a mean age of 35,6 years (range 19-66 years). Renal trauma was due to a traffic accident in 8 patients. Renal damage appeared to be disproportionate to the severity of the trauma (minor trauma). They had a lower rate of associated trauma to other abdominal organs (four patients only). Urinary stones were present in 5 patients, pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction in 3, horseshoe kidny in 3, ectopic kidney in 2 and upper urinary tract carcinoma in one case. Early nephrectomy was required in three cases for hemodynamic instability. Ureteral stenting was indicated in 3 cases. Six patients were operated later because of their underlying renal pathology. A conservative treatment was possible only in 7 of cases. The PPD related to renal trauma varide from 0 to 13% in all cases. PERL may complicate a negligible renal trauma while in some cases they may be of vital importance for the patient's final outcome. The imaging findings are crucial but may be confusing. The therapeutic approach is, to a large extent, dependent on the type of PERL and the severity of damage, and is often conservative in the hemo-dynamically stable patient. Accountability link may be difficult to establish and the PPD depends on the PERL and the renal injuries severity. We have no involvement with funding in this case. Ethical approval: Not required Conflicts of interest: None.

27576084|t|Polymeric Nanostructure Compiled with Multifunctional Components To Exert Tumor - Targeted Delivery of Antiangiogenic Gene for Tumor Growth Suppression
27576084|a|Nucleic acid-based therapy has emerged as a revolutionary methodology for treatment of the diseases related to protein dysfunction; however, lack of systemically applicable synthetic delivery systems limits its current usage in local applications, particularly for DNA-based therapy with regard to the poor bioavailability in the systemic administrations. To overcome this obstacle, we compiled multiple chemistry-based strategies into the manufacture of the gene delivery formulations to pursue improved tolerability of DNA to the enzymatic degradation in the biological milieu and prolonged retention in the systemic circulation. Here, we constructed a distinctive multilayered functional architecture: plasmid DNA (pDNA) was electrostatically complexed with cationic poly(lysine) (polyplex) as the interior pDNA reservoir, which was further cross-linked by redox - responsive disulfide cross-linking to minimize the occurrence of polyplex disassembly through exchange reaction with the biological charged components. Still, the pDNA reservoir was spatially protected by a sequential thermoresponsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) palisade as the intermediate barrier and a biocompatible hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) shell with the aim of preventing the accessibility of the biological species, particularly the nuclease degradation to the pDNA payload. Subsequent investigations validated the utilities of these strategies in accomplishing prolonged blood retention. In an attempt to apply this method for tumor therapy, ligand cyclic (Arg-Gly-Asp) peptide was attached at the distal end of PEG, validating prompted tumor - targeted delivery and gene expression of the loaded antiangiogenic gene at the targeted tumor cells and accordingly exerting antiangiogenesis of the tumors for abrogation of tumor growth. Together with its excellent safe profile, the proposed formulation suggests potential utility as a practical gene delivery system for treatment of intractable diseases.

27578508|t|Evaluation of the VIDAS Anti-HCV Assay for Detection of Hepatitis C Virus Infection
27578508|a|Anti-hepatitis C virus antibody (anti-HCV) assays are recommended for screening HCV -infected persons. The VIDAS Anti-HCV Assay (bioMérieux, France), based on the enzyme-linked fluorescence test principle, was recently introduced in Korea. We evaluated the clinical performance of the VIDAS assay. One hundred HCV-positive and 1,002 HCV-negative blood samples confirmed by Architect anti-HCV (Abbott Laboratories, USA) and COBAS TaqMan HCV real-time PCR (Roche Diagnostics, USA) or the Procleix Ultrio Plus Assay (Gen-Probe Incorporated, USA) were obtained from the Human Serum Bank (HSB) and tested by VIDAS. In case of discrepant results, we conducted a recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA). The agreement rates for known HCV-positive and HCV-negative samples between the VIDAS assay and the HSB testing were 100% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 96.4-100%) and 99.5% (95% CI: 98.8-99.8%), respectively. One of the five discrepant samples was positive for Core 2+ and NS3-2 2+ reactivity, two samples were negative, and the other two were indeterminate regarding NS4 2+ reactivity in RIBA. We observed a significant but weak positive correlation between the titers of VIDAS and Architect assays (r=0.315, P<0.001). The VIDAS anti-HCV assay, developed on the VIDAS automated immunoassay platform based on the ready-to-use, single-sample test concept may be useful in small-to-medium-sized laboratories. It showed good agreement with Architect anti-HCV and COBAS PCR assays and is therefore useful for detection of HCV infection. Weakly test-positive (ambiguous) samples require additional testing by another anti-HCV, RIBA, or HCV RNA assay.

27581456|t|Reassembly of Excitable Domains after CNS Axon Regeneration
27581456|a|Action potential initiation and propagation in myelinated axons require ion channel clustering at axon initial segments (AIS) and nodes of Ranvier. Disruption of these domains after injury impairs nervous system function. Traditionally, injured CNS axons are considered refractory to regeneration, but some recent approaches challenge this view by showing robust long-distance regeneration. However, whether these approaches allow remyelination and promote the reestablishment of AIS and nodes of Ranvier is unknown. Using mouse optic nerve crush as a model for CNS traumatic injury, we performed a detailed analysis of AIS and node disruption after nerve crush. We found significant disruption of AIS and loss of nodes within days of the crush, and complete loss of nodes 1 week after injury. Genetic deletion of the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten) in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), coupled with stimulation of RGCs by inflammation and cAMP, dramatically enhanced regeneration. With this treatmen t, we found significant reestablishment of RGC AIS, remyelination, and even reassembly of nodes in regions proximal, within, and distal to the crush site. Remyelination began near the retina, progressed distally, and was confirmed by electron microscopy. Although axons grew rapidly, remyelination and nodal ion channel clustering was much slower. Finally, genetic deletion of ankyrinG from RGCs to block AIS reassembly did not affect axon regeneration, indicating that preservation of neuronal polarity is not required for axon regeneration. Together, our results demonstrate, for the first time, that regenerating CNS axons can be remyelinated and reassemble new AIS and nodes of Ranvier. We show, for the first time, that regenerated CNS axons have the capacity to both remyelinate and reassemble the axon initial segments and nodes of Ranvier necessary for rapid and efficient action potential propagation.

27588139|t|Clinicopathological relevance of kinesin family member 18A expression in invasive breast cancer
27588139|a|Recently, kinesin motor proteins have been focused on as targets for cancer therapy. Kinesins are microtubule -based motor proteins that mediate diverse functions within the cell, including the transport of vesicles, organelles, chromosomes and protein complexes, as well as the movement of microtubules. In the current study, the expression of kinesin family member 18A (KIF18A), a member of kinesin superfamily, was investigated in breast cancer using immunohistochemistry, and its effect on breast cancer prognosis was examined. KIF18A expression level was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis (P=0.047). In patients with high levels of KIF18A expression, survival was significantly poorer compared to patients with low levels of KIF18A expression (disease-free survival, P=0.030). Multivariate analysis revealed that venous invasion (hazard ratio, 9.22; 95% confidence interval, 3.90-23.66; P<0.001) and KIF18A expression (hazard ratio, 3.20; 95% confidence interval, 1.34-6.09; P=0.010) were independent predictive factors for lymph node metastasis. KIF18A may be a useful predictive marker for lymph node metastasis in breast cancer, which could facilitate curative adjuvant treatment.

27589009|a|Infliximab is an anti-tumor necrosis factor monoclonal antibody approved in chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Infliximab pharmacokinetics is variable between patients, but influence of the underlying disease was never assessed. This study aimed at assessing this influence using a cohort of patients monitored in a single center and with the same assay. Infliximab trough concentrations were determined on samples collected between weeks 0 and 22 after treatment initiation in 218 patients treated for RA, PsA, AS, CD or UC. Infliximab pharmacokinetics was analyzed by a one-compartment population model with first-order elimination rate constant. In AS patients, volume of distribution (V) and elimination clearance (CL) were 5.4 L and 0.24 L/day, respectively. In CD and UC patients, V was 49% and 52% higher than in AS, respectively, and CL was 47% and 60% higher than in AS, respectively. In RA patients, CL was 49% higher than in AS patients. Simulations showed that without methotrexate, a 3 mg/kg dosing regimen would lead only 16% of RA patients to reach the target concentration (2.5 mg/L) at week 22, whereas target concentrations would be reached in approximately half of RA patients cotreated with methotrexate, as well as half of CD (3.5 mg/L) and UC (3.7 mg/L) patients. The suboptimality of approved dosing regimens supports the development of dosing optimization based on concentration measurements.

27590021|t|International validation of a urinary biomarker panel for identification of active lupus nephritis in children
27590021|a|Conventional markers of juvenile-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (JSLE) disease activity fail to adequately identify lupus nephritis (LN). While individual novel urine biomarkers are good at detecting LN flares, biomarker panels may improve diagnostic accuracy. The aim of this study was to assess the performance of a biomarker panel to identify active LN in two international JSLE cohorts. Novel urinary biomarkers, namely vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), lipocalin-like prostaglandin D synthase (LPGDS), transferrin (TF), ceruloplasmin, alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), were quantified in a cross-sectional study that included participants of the UK JSLE Cohort Study (Cohort 1) and validated within the Einstein Lupus Cohort (Cohort 2). Binary logistic regression modelling and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis [area under the curve (AUC)] were used to identify and assess combinations of biomarkers for diagnostic accuracy. A total of 91 JSLE patients were recruited across both cohorts, of whom 31 (34 %) had active LN and 60 (66 %) had no LN. Urinary AGP, ceruloplasmin, VCAM-1, MCP-1 and LPGDS levels were significantly higher in those patients with active LN than in non - LN patients [all corrected p values (p c) < 0.05] across both cohorts. Urinary TF also differed between patient groups in Cohort 2 (p c = 0.001). Within Cohort 1, the optimal biomarker panel included AGP, ceruloplasmin, LPGDS and TF (AUC 0.920 for active LN identification). These results were validated in Cohort 2, with the same markers resulting in the optimal urine biomarker panel (AUC 0.991). In two international JSLE cohorts, urinary AGP, ceruloplasmin, LPGDS and TF demonstrate an 'excellent' ability for accurately identifying active LN in children.

27593389|t|Fine structure of interleukin 18 (IL-18) receptor - immunoreactive neurons in the retrosplenial cortex and its changes in IL18 knockout mice
27593389|a|Interleukin 18 (IL-18) participates in the inflammatory immune response of lymphocytes. Delay in learning or memory are common in the IL-18 knockout mouse. Many IL-18 - immunoreactive neurons are found in the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) and the subiculum. These neurons also contain the IL-18 receptor. We determined the location and the ultrastructure of the IL-18 receptor - immunoreactive neurons in the RSC and observed changes in the IL-18 receptor - immunoreactive neurons of the IL-18 knockout mouse. The IL-18 receptor - immunoreactive neurons were found specifically in layer V of the granular RSC. They were medium-sized neurons with a light oval nucleus and had little cytoplasm with many free ribosomes, rough endoplasmic reticulum and many mitochondria, but no Nissl bodies. The number of axosomatic terminals was about six per section. The IL-18 receptor - immunoreactive neurons were not found in the RSC in the IL-18 knockout mouse at 5 or 9 weeks of age. However, many small electron-dense neurons were found in layer V. Both the nucleus and cytoplasm were electron-dense, but not necrotic. The mitochondria and rough endoplasmic reticulum were swollen. The IL-18 receptor - immunoreactive neurons were presumed to be degenerating. The degeneration of the IL18-receptor - immunoreactive neurons in the RSC may cause the abnormal behaviors of the IL-18 knockout mice.

27593461|t|Exploring the genetic variability in water use efficiency: Evaluation of inter and intra cultivar genetic diversity in grapevines
27593461|a|Genetic improvement of crop Water Use Efficiency (WUE) is a general goal because the increasing water scarcity and the trend to a more sustainable agriculture. For grapevines, this subject is relevant and need an urgent response because their wide distribution in semi-arid areas. New cultivars are difficult to introduce in viticulture due to the narrow dependency of consumer appreciation often linked to a certain particular wine taste. Clones of reputed cultivars would presumably be more accepted but little is known on the intra-cultivar genetic variability of the WUE. The present work compares, on the basis of two field assays, the variability of intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi) in a large collection of cultivars in contrast with a collection of clones of Tempranillo cultivar. The results show that clonal variability of WUEi was around 80% of the inter-cultivar, thus providing a first assessment on the opportunity for clonal selection by WUE. Plotting the WUEi data against stem water potential or stomatal conductance it was possible to identify cultivars and clones out of the confidence intervals of this linear regression thus with significantly higher and lower WUEi values. The present results contribute to open the expectative for a genetic improvement of grapevine WUE.

27596934|t|Comparison of methods for isolating primary hepatocytes from mini pigs
27596934|a|Successful porcine hepatocyte isolation is crucial for the development of bioartificial liver devices and hepatocyte transplantation. Serva collagenase NB grades are formulated collagenases that are suitable for various tissue isolation applications. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) can improve the viability of human hepatocytes. The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of two collagenases and effect of NAC on hepatocyte isolation from porcine liver tissue. Porcine hepatocytes were isolated using the perfusion method from Bama mini pigs assigned to the Serva NB 4 group (n=6), the Serva NB 8 group (n=6), or the NB 8 + NAC group (n=6). Viability and yield were defined as fresh hepatocytes and their spheroids formation after 24-hour rocker culture in serum-free medium. Metabolic function was assessed by gene expression, albumin, and urea synthesis. All procedures resulted in successful hepatocyte isolation. Cells from the NB 8 + NAC group had (97.8±1.9)% viability, which was higher than the NB 8 group with (94.4±2.4)% and the NB 4 group with (94.5±3.2)% (P<.001). The final cell yield reached (11.8±1.0)×10(9) cells in the NB 8 + NAC group, compared to (9.5±2.1)×10(9) cells in the NB 8 group (P<.01) and (9.1±1.1) ×10(9) cells in the NB 4 group (P<.001). The secretion of albumin was superior in the NB 8 + NAC group at a concentration of (425.8±35.3) ng/mL compared to the NB 8 group (339.1±32.6) ng/mL (P <.001) and NB 4 group (293.6±43.3) ng/mL (P <.01). The injury of hepatocytes also decreased in the NB 8 + NAC group (P<.01). The data are presented as means ± SD. Formulated collagenase Serva NB 8 and NAC could improve the porcine hepatocyte isolation, resulting in higher yields of viable cells.

27598472|t|Endothermal venous ablation of the saphenous vein on patients who are on anticoagulation therapy
27598472|a|The purpose of this study was to evaluate the risks of bleeding, deep venous thrombosis (DVT), endovenous heat induced thrombosis (EHIT) and failure of ablation on patients who undergo ablation while on oral anticoagulation. We compared 378 (3.4%) out of 11252 patients (group A) who had undergone 724 endovenous ablation of the saphenous veins from January 1, 2011 to September 30, 2014 while on oral anticoagulation to a randomly selected 375 patients (group B) who underwent 641 endovenous ablation in the same time period but were not on anticoagulation. The demographic data, history of DVT, the Clinical, Etiologic, Anatomic, Pathologic (CEAP) classification and the VCSS (Venous Clinical Severity Score) scores were analyzed. The indications for anticoagulation, the anticoagulants used were recorded. The primary endpoints were bleeding, development of DVT or EHIT, and failure of ablation. Patients in group A were older, had more men, more history of DVT and PE, had higher CEAP and VCSS scores compared to group B. The type of anticoagulation used was warfarin in 77.2% direct oral inhibitors (DOIs) in 22.8%. The rate of failure of ablation at 3 days was 39 (5.6%) for Group A and 3 (0.5%) for Group B (P<0.0001) and at one month it was 46 (10.1%) vs. 27 (6.7%) (P=0.086). The number of EHIT cases in group A at 3 days was 2 (0.3%), compared to 6 (0.9%) in group B (P=0.016) and at 1 month it was 0 compared to 4 (1.0%) (P=0.0483). The DVT, SVT, hematoma and wound infection rates were similar in the two groups. Ablation of the saphenous veins in patients who are on oral anticoagulation is safe and does not increase the risk of bleeding or hematoma, but it may slightly lower the incidence of EHIT and increase the incidence of failure of ablation.

27599756|t|Variation analysis of PRIM1 gene in Chinese patients with primary ovarian insufficiency
27599756|a|Insights into common genetic susceptibility between primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) and natural or early menopause have delivered an innovative way of assessing the genetic mechanisms involved in POI. PRIM1 plays a crucial role in DNA replication by synthesizing RNA primers for Okazaki fragments. It is closely associated with age at natural menopause, early menopause and POI in European women. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether mutations in PRIM1 contribute to POI in Chinese women. All exons and exon-intron boundaries of PRIM1 gene were sequenced in 192 Han Chinese women with non-syndromic POI. No plausible mutations were identified. The results suggest that the perturbations in PRIM1 gene are not a common explanation for POI in Chinese women.

27602302|t|Selection of a marker gene to construct a reference library for wetland plants, and the application of metabarcoding to analyze the diet of wintering herbivorous waterbirds
27602302|a|Food availability and diet selection are important factors influencing the abundance and distribution of wild waterbirds. In order to better understand changes in waterbird population, it is essential to figure out what they feed on. However, analyzing their diet could be difficult and inefficient using traditional methods such as microhistologic observation. Here, we addressed this gap of knowledge by investigating the diet of greater white-fronted goose Anser albifrons and bean goose Anser fabalis, which are obligate herbivores wintering in China, mostly in the Middle and Lower Yangtze River floodplain. First, we selected a suitable and high-resolution marker gene for wetland plants that these geese would consume during the wintering period. Eight candidate genes were included: rbcL, rpoC1, rpoB, matK, trnH-psbA, trnL (UAA), atpF-atpH, and psbK-psbI. The selection was performed via analysis of representative sequences from NCBI and comparison of amplification efficiency and resolution power of plant samples collected from the wintering area. The trnL gene was chosen at last with c/h primers, and a local plant reference library was constructed with this gene. Then, utilizing DNA metabarcoding, we discovered 15 food items in total from the feces of these birds. Of the 15 unique dietary sequences, 10 could be identified at specie level. As for greater white-fronted goose, 73% of sequences belonged to Poaceae spp., and 26% belonged to Carex spp. In contrast, almost all sequences of bean goose belonged to Carex spp. (99%). Using the same samples, microhistology provided consistent food composition with metabarcoding results for greater white-fronted goose, while 13% of Poaceae was recovered for bean goose. In addition, two other taxa were discovered only through microhistologic analysis. Although most of the identified taxa matched relatively well between the two methods, DNA metabarcoding gave taxonomically more detailed information. Discrepancies were likely due to biased PCR amplification in metabarcoding, low discriminating power of current marker genes for monocots, and biases in microhistologic analysis. The diet differences between two geese species might indicate deeper ecological significance beyond the scope of this study. We concluded that DNA metabarcoding provides new perspectives for studies of herbivorous waterbird diets and inter-specific interactions, as well as new possibilities to investigate interactions between herbivores and plants. In addition, microhistologic analysis should be used together with metabarcoding methods to integrate this information.

27602763|t|Expressions of CD8 + TILs, PD-L1 and Foxp3 + TILs in stage I NSCLC guiding adjuvant chemotherapy decisions
27602763|a|Currently, adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended for patients with high risk stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, identifying high risk patients remains a challenge. This study aims to identify the patient cohorts more likely to benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy based on the tumor micro-immune environment. CD8 + TILs significantly associated with disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survial (OS) (p=0.002; 0.040). Patients with high risk factors may also predict shorter DFS (P=0.056). When compared together, patients with high - CD8 + TILs showed better DFS than patients with low - CD8 + TILs, no matter their risk factors status. There's no correlation between PD-L1 expressions and survival. PD-L1 was highly expressed in men, squamous and well differentiated carcinoma. In addition, Foxp3 + TILs alone didn't show any prognostic effects, but low - Foxp3 / high - CD8 + TILs were associated with prolonged DFS (p=0.031). A total of 126 patients with surgically resected stage I NSCLC were included to perform immunohistochemistry of CD8 + tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) and forkhead box P3 (Foxp3)+ TILs. CD8 + TILs are effective prognostic predictors. Patients with surgically resected stage I NSCLC showing low CD8 + TILs could be considered for adjuvant chemotherapy, even if they have no high risk features.

27604681|t|Unaffected twins discordant for affective disorders show changes in anterior callosal white matter microstructure
27604681|a|The neurobiological mechanisms mediating an increased risk to develop affective disorders remain poorly understood. In a group of individuals with a family history of major depressive (MDD) or bipolar disorder (BD), we investigated the microstructural properties of white matter fiber tracts, that is, cingulum bundle, uncinate fasciculus, anterior limb of the internal capsule, and corpus callosum, that facilitate the communication between brain regions implicated in affective disorders. Eighty-nine healthy mono - or dizygotic twins with a co-twin diagnosed with MDD or BD (high-risk) and 57 healthy twins with a co-twin with no familial history of affective disorders (low-risk) were included in a diffusion tensor imaging study. The high-risk group showed decreased fractional anisotropy (FA), a measure of water diffusion directionality, and increased radial diffusivity in the anterior region of corpus callosum compared to the low-risk group. This abnormality was not associated with zygosity or type of depressive disorder of co-twin. The observed decreased anterior callosal fiber FA in the high-risk group may be indicative of a compromised interhemispheric communication between left and right frontal regions critically involved in mood regulation. Reduced anterior callosal FA may act as a vulnerability marker for affective disorders in individuals at familial risk.

27605910|t|A Window on the Study of Aversive Instrumental Learning: Strains, Performance, Neuroendocrine, and Immunologic Systems
27605910|a|The avoidance response is present in pathological anxiety and interferes with normal daily functions. The aim of this article is to shed light on performance markers of active avoidance (AA) using two different rat strains, Sprague-Dawley (SD) and Wistar. Specifically, good and poor performers were evaluated regarding anxiety traits exhibited in the elevated plus maze (EPM) and corticosterone levels and motor activity in the open field test. In addition, the plasma levels of Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Interleukin-1Beta (IL-1beta), Nerve Growth Factor Beta (NGF-beta), Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha (TNF-alpha) and cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant 1 (CINC-1) were compared in the good and poor performers to better understand the role of the immunologic system in aversive learning. Behavioral criteria were employed to identify subpopulations of SD and Wistar rats based on their behavioral scores during a two-way AA test. The animals were tested for anxiety -like behavior in the EPM and motor activity in the open-field test. Plasma corticosterone levels were measured at the end of the avoidance test. Cytokine levels of IL-6, IL-1beta, NGF-beta, TNF-alpha, and CINC-1 were measured in the plasma of the Wistar rats. Sixty-six percent of the Wistar rats and 35% of the SD rats exhibited a poor performance. This feature was associated with a decrease in anxiety -like behavior in the EPM. The poor and good performers exhibited lower levels of corticosterone compared with the control animals, which suggests that training alters corticosterone levels, thereby leading to hypocortisolism, independent of the performance. The CINC-1 levels were increased in the poor performers, which reinforces the role of immunologic system activation in learning deficits. Our study provides a better understanding of the complex interactions that underlie neuroimmune consequences and their implications for performance.

27609696|t|Costing ' healthy' food baskets in Australia - a systematic review of food price and affordability monitoring tools, protocols and methods
27609696|a|To undertake a systematic review to determine similarities and differences in metrics and results between recently and/or currently used tools, protocols and methods for monitoring Australian healthy food prices and affordability. Electronic databases of peer-reviewed literature and online grey literature were systematically searched using the PRISMA approach for articles and reports relating to healthy food and diet price assessment tools, protocols, methods and results that utilised retail pricing. National, state, regional and local areas of Australia from 1995 to 2015. Assessment tools, protocols and methods to measure the price of 'healthy' foods and diets. The search identified fifty-nine discrete surveys of ' healthy' food pricing incorporating six major food pricing tools (those used in multiple areas and time periods) and five minor food pricing tools (those used in a single survey area or time period). Analysis demonstrated methodological differences regarding: included foods; reference households; use of availability and/or quality measures; household income sources; store sampling methods; data collection protocols; analysis methods; and results. ' Healthy' food price assessment methods used in Australia lack comparability across all metrics and most do not fully align with a ' healthy' diet as recommended by the current Australian Dietary Guidelines. None have been applied nationally. Assessment of the price, price differential and affordability of healthy (recommended) and current (unhealthy) diets would provide more robust and meaningful data to inform health and fiscal policy in Australia. The INFORMAS ' optimal ' approach provides a potential framework for development of these methods.

27610122|t|Consecutive Endovascular Treatment of 20 Ruptured Very Small (<3 mm) Anterior Communicating Artery Aneurysms
27610122|a|Small aneurysms located at the anterior communicating artery carry significant procedural challenges due to a complex anatomy. Recent advances in endovascular technologies have expanded the use of coil embolization for small aneurysm treatment. However, limited reports describe their safety and efficacy profiles in very small anterior communicating artery aneurysms. We sought to review and report the immediate and long-term clinical as well as radiographic outcomes of consecutive patients with ruptured very small anterior communicating artery aneurysms treated with current endovascular coil embolization techniques. A prospectively maintained single-institution neuroendovascular database was accessed to identify consecutive cases of very small (<3 mm) ruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysms treated endovascularly between 2006 and 2013. A total of 20 patients with ruptured very small (<3 mm) anterior communicating artery aneurysms were consecutively treated with coil embolization. The average maximum diameter was 2.66 ± 0.41 mm. Complete aneurysm occlusion was achieved for 17 (85%) aneurysms and near-complete aneurysm occlusion for 3 (15%) aneurysms. Intraoperative perforation was seen in 2 (10%) patients without any clinical worsening or need for an external ventricular drain. A thromboembolic event occurred in 1 (5 %) patient without clinical worsening or radiologic infarct. Median clinical follow-up was 12 (±14.1) months and median imaging follow-up was 12 (±18.4) months. This report describes the largest series of consecutive endovascular treatments of ruptured very small anterior communicating artery aneurysms. These findings suggest that coil embolization of very small aneurysms in this location can be performed with acceptable rates of complications and recanalization.

27613669|t|Factors affecting the formation of nitrogenous disinfection by-products during chlorination of aspartic acid in drinking water
27613669|a|The formation of emerging nitrogenous disinfection by-products (N-DBPs) from the chlorination of aspartic acid (Asp) was investigated. The yield of dichloroacetonitrile (DCAN) was higher than other N-DBPs, such as dichloroacetamide (DCAcAm) and chloropicrin (TCNM) during the chlorination of Asp. The formation of DCAN, DCAcAm, and TCNM all showed a trend of first increasing and then decreasing during the chlorination of Asp with increasing contact time. The dosage of chlorine had an impact on the formation of DCAN, DCAcAm, and TCNM. The highest yields of DCAN and DCAcAm appeared when the Cl2 / Asp molar ratio was about 20, the yield of TCNM increased with increasing the Cl2 / Asp molar ratio from 5 to 30 and TCNM was not produced when the ratio was less than 5. Cyanogen chloride (CNCl) was detected when the Cl2 / Asp molar ratio was lower than 5. N-DBPs formation was influenced by pH. DCAN formation increased with increasing pH from 5 to 6 and then decreased with increasing pH from 6 to 9, but DCAcAm and TCNM increased with increasing pH from 5 to 8 and then decreased. Higher temperatures reduced the formation of DCAN and DCAcAm, but increased TCNM formation. DCAN and DCAcAm formation decreased, and relatively stable TCNM formation increased, with increasing free chlorine contact time during chloramination. N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) was produced during chloramination of Asp and increased with prolonged chloramination contact time. The presence of bromide ions enhanced the yields of haloacetonitriles and shifted N-DBPs to more brominated species.

27614145|t|Midodrine and tolvaptan in patients with cirrhosis and refractory or recurrent ascites: a randomised pilot study
27614145|a|Splanchnic arterial vasodilatation and subsequent sodium and water retention play an important role in cirrhotic ascites. Midodrine and tolvaptan have been used separately in these patients. However, there are no reports on the use of combination of midodrine and tolvaptan in the control of ascites. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of midodrine, tolvaptan and their combination in control of refractory or recurrent ascites in cirrhotics. Fifty cirrhotic patients with refractory or recurrent ascites were randomised to receive midodrine (n=13), tolvaptan (n=12) or both (n=13) plus standard medical therapy (SMT) or SMT alone (n=12). A significant increase in urinary volume and urinary sodium at 1 and 3 months (P<.05) was observed in all groups except SMT. There was no worsening of renal or hepatic function in any group. There was deterioration of model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) in SMT. Midodrine as well as combination of midodrine and tolvaptan but not tolvaptan alone was superior to SMT in control of ascites at 3 months (P<.05). The combination therapy was also superior to midodrine in the control of ascites at 1 month. The morbidity and mortality were similar in all the groups except SMT. The results of this pilot study suggest that midodrine and combination with tolvaptan better controls ascites without any renal or hepatic dysfunction. The combination therapy rapidly controls ascites as compared to midodrine or tolvaptan alone.

27618138|t|Acute Complicated Sinusitis: Ten Years Experience from the University Hospital of the West Indies
27618138|a|Complicated sinusitis is rare. It might not be identified early and might expose the patient to an unfavourable outcome. There is a paucity of data regarding this condition in the Caribbean. This study was undertaken to describe the clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients admitted with this condition. A retrospective chart review was performed on patients admitted to the University Hospital of the West Indies (UHWI) with complicated sinusitis between 1999 to 2011. The data was analysed using SPSS statistics 22 software. There were 30 patients (23 males and 7 females). The mean (SD) age was 19 (13.96) years. Twenty-two had orbital complications, two had intracranial complications and one had both. The most common organisms isolated were streptococcus and the most common sensitivity was to amoxicillin and clavulinic acid. Sixteen patients who had an external surgical approach had a mean (SD) hospital stay of 8.8 (3.71) days compared to three patients who had a purely endoscopic approach who had a mean (SD) hospital stay of 7.67 (0.577) days. There was no statistical difference in mean hospital stay between these two groups (95% CI,-3.49-5.78; p = 0.609). The mean duration of hospital stay for those treated medically was six days versus ten days for the surgical group. The mean difference was three days (95% CI, 0.193-6.595; p = 0.039). Acute complicated sinusitis is seen more commonly in adolescent males. The most common complication was orbital. Surgical treatment is indicated for those patients who fail medical management and should consist of an endoscopic approach which may be combined with open approaches if indicated.

27619227|t|Comparative proteomic analysis reveals alterations in development and photosynthesis -related proteins in diploid and triploid rice
27619227|a|Polyploidy has pivotal influences on rice (Oryza sativa L.) morphology and physiology, and is very important for understanding rice domestication and improving agricultural traits. Diploid (DP) and triploid (TP) rice shows differences in morphological parameters, such as plant height, leaf length, leaf width and the physiological index of chlorophyll content. However, the underlying mechanisms determining these morphological differences are remain to be defined. To better understand the proteomic changes between DP and TP, tandem mass tags (TMT) mass spectrometry (MS) / MS was used to detect the significant changes to protein expression between DP and TP. Results indicated that both photosynthesis and metabolic pathways were highly significantly associated with proteomic alteration between DP and TP based on biological process and pathway enrichment analysis, and 13 higher abundance chloroplast proteins involving in these two pathways were identified in TP. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that 5 of the 13 chloroplast proteins ATPF, PSAA, PSAB, PSBB and RBL in TP were higher abundance compared with those in DP. This study integrates morphology, physiology and proteomic profiling alteration of DP and TP to address their underlying different molecular mechanisms. Our finding revealed that ATPF, PSAA, PSAB, PSBB and RBL can induce considerable expression changes in TP and may affect the development and growth of rice through photosynthesis and metabolic pathways.

27621870|t|Correlation of cardiopulmonary exercise testing parameters with quality of life in stable COPD patients
27621870|a|The precise head to head relationships between Cardio-pulmonary exercise testing (CPET) parameters and patients ' daily symptoms / activities and the disease social / emotional impact are less well defined. In this study, the correlation of COPD daily symptoms and quality of life [assessed by St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ)] and COPD severity index (BODE-index) with CPET parameters were investigated. Symptom -limited CPET was performed in 37 consecutive COPD (GOLD I-III) subjects during non- exacerbation phase. The SGRQ was also completed by each patient. SGRQ-score correlated negatively with FEV1 (r=-0.49, P<0.01), predicted maximal work-rate (%WR-max) (r=-0.44, P<0.01), V'O2 / WR (r=-0.52, P<0.01) and breathing reserve (r=-0.50, P<0.01). However it did not correlate with Peak-V'O2 % predicted (r=-0.27, P=0.10). In 20 (54.1%) subjects in which leg fatigue was the main cause for stopping the test, Peak-V'O2, %WR-max, HR-Reserve and Breathing reserve were higher (P=0.04, <0.01, 0.04 and <0.01 respectively) than the others. There was also a significant correlation between BODE-index and ∆VO2 / ∆WR (r=-0.64, P<0.001) and breathing-reserve (r=-0.38, P=0.018). The observed relationships between CPET parameter and daily subjective complaints in COPD were not strong. Those who discontinued the CPET because of leg fatigue were in the earlier stages of COPD. Significant negative correlation between ∆VO2 / ∆WR and BODE-index suggests that along with COPD progression, regardless of negative past history, other comorbidities such as cardiac / musculoskeletal problems should be sought.

27621953|t|Intrapartum Cervical Laceration and Subsequent Pregnancy Outcomes
27621953|a|The objective of this study was to describe pregnancy outcomes, including cervical insufficiency and preterm birth, in the subsequent pregnancy following an intrapartum cervical laceration. Retrospective cohort of women with their first two consecutive singleton pregnancies carried to ≥ 20(0/7) weeks ' gestation within a tertiary health care system from 2002 to 2012. Cervical laceration cases were identified by ICD9 codes and included if suture repair was required. In this study, 55 women were confirmed to have a cervical laceration in the first delivery; 43 lacerations after vaginal delivery (VD) and 12 after cesarean delivery (CD). The median gestational age of the first delivery was 40(0/7) weeks and the median birth weight 3,545 g; these did not differ between VD and CD. In the second pregnancy, 2 of 55 women (4.6%) had a prophylactic cerclage placed; 1 carried to term and the other delivered at 35(6/7) weeks. In total, four women (9.3%) delivered the second pregnancy < 37 weeks: three had a prior term VD and one had a prior 34 weeks VD. There was only one case of recurrent cervical laceration, occurring in the setting of vaginal deliveries. Obstetric cervical lacerations are uncommon. Complications in the following pregnancy were low, despite lack of additional prophylactic cerclage use.

27623760|t|A Wnt Pathway Activator Induces Apoptosis and Cell Death in Mouse Monocytic Leukemia Cells
27623760|a|A Wnt agonist, 2-amino-4-[3,4-(methylenedioxy)benzylamino]-6-(3-methoxyphenyl) pyrimidine, is a cell-permeable pyrimidine compound that has been shown to mimic the effect of Wnt. In this study, leukemic mouse cell lines, RAW 264.7 and J774.1, were incubated with the Wnt agonist. The Wnt agonist showed cell death in the concentration of 1-10 μM. The Wnt agonist did not show inhibition of GSK-3β activity but induced β-catenin accumulation in the nucleus. The Wnt agonist showed caspase-independent cell death, but no further involvement in cell death ER stress signaling. Here we discuss the possible mechanism of Wnt agonist - induced apoptotic cell death in RAW 264.7 cells.

27625333|t|Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation outcomes in children with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis
27625333|a|Pediatric patients with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) may develop refractory respiratory or cardiac failure that warrants consideration for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support. The purposes of this study were to describe the use and outcomes of ECMO in pediatric HLH patients, to identify risk factors for hospital mortality and to compare their ECMO use and outcomes to the ECMO population as a whole. Pediatric patients (⩽ 18 years) with a diagnosis of HLH in the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) Registry were included. Between 1983 and 2014, data for 30 children with HLH were available in the ELSO registry and all were included in this study. All cases occurred in the last decade. Of the 30 HLH patients, 24 (80%) had a respiratory indication for ECMO and six (20%) had a cardiac indication (of which 4 were E - CPR and 2 cardiac failure). Of the 24 respiratory ECMO patients, 63% were placed on VA ECMO. Compared with all pediatric patients in the ELSO registry during the study period (n=17,007), HLH patients had worse hospital survival (non-HLH 59% vs HLH 30%, p =0.001). In pediatric HLH patients, no pre- ECMO risk factors for mortality were identified. The development of a hemorrhagic complication on ECMO was associated with decreased mortality (p =0.01). Comparing HLH patients with respiratory failure to patients with other immune compromised conditions, the overall survival rate is similar (HLH 38% vs. non-HLH immune compromised 31%, p =0.64). HLH is an uncommon indication for ECMO and these patients have increased mortality compared to the overall pediatric ECMO population. These data should be factored into decision-making when considering ECMO for pediatric HLH patients.

27625705|t|Gut microbiome alterations in patients with stage 4 hepatitis C
27625705|a|Hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes debilitating liver diseases, which may progress to cirrhosis and cancer, and claims 500,000 annual lives worldwide. While HCV epidemiology, pathophysiology, and therapy are being deeply studied, rare attention is given to reciprocal interactions between HCV infection, HCV -induced chronic liver diseases, and the human gut microbiome. As Egypt has the world's highest prevalence of HCV infections, we launched this study to monitor differences in the gut microbial community composition of Egyptian HCV patients that may affect, or result from, the patients ' liver state. To this end, we analyzed stool samples from six stage 4 - HCV patients and eight healthy individuals by high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing using Illumina MiSeq. Overall, the alpha-diversity of the healthy persons' gut microbiomes was higher than those of the HCV patients. Whereas members of phylum Bacteroidetes were more abundant in HCV patients, healthy individuals had higher abundance of Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria. Genus -level analysis showed differential abundance of Prevotella and Faecalibacterium (higher in HCV patients) vs. Ruminococcus and Clostridium (healthy group), indicating that the higher abundance of Bacteroidetes in HCV patients is most likely due to Prevotella overabundance. The probiotic genus, Bifidobacterium, was only observed in the microbiotas of healthy individuals. To the best of our knowledge, this study provides a first overview of major phyla and genera differentiating stage 4 - HCV patients from healthy individuals and suggests possible microbiome remodeling in chronic hepatitis C, possibly shaped by bacterial translocation as well as the liver's impaired role in digestion and protein synthesis. Future studies will investigate the microbiome composition and functional capabilities in more patients while tracing some potential biomarker taxa (e.g., Prevotella, Faecalibacterium vs. Bifidobacterium).

27626099|t|Peptide -Mediated Interference of PB2 - eIF4G1 Interaction Inhibits Influenza A Viruses ' Replication in Vitro and in Vivo
27626099|a|Influenza viruses are obligate parasites that hijack the host cellular system. Previous results have shown that the influenza virus PB2 subunit confers a dependence of host eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4-γ 1 (eIF4G1) for viral mRNA translation. Here, we demonstrated that peptide -mediated interference of the PB2 - eIF4G1 interaction inhibited virus replication in vitro and in vivo. Remarkably, intranasal administration of the peptide provided 100% protection against lethal challenges of influenza A viruses in BALB/c mice, including H1N1, H5N1, and H7N9 influenza virus subtypes. Mapping of the PB2 protein indicated that the eIF4G1 binding sites resided within the PB2 cap - binding domain. Virtual docking analysis suggested that the inhibitory peptide associated with the conserved amino acid residues that were essential to PB2 cap-binding activity. Overall, our results identified the PB2 - eIF4G1 interactive site as a druggable target for influenza therapeutics.

27626498|t|DRG1 is a potential oncogene in lung adenocarcinoma and promotes tumor progression via spindle checkpoint signaling regulation
27626498|a|Developmentally regulated GTP binding protein 1 (DRG1), a member of the DRG family, plays important roles in regulating cell growth. However, the molecular basis of DRG1 in cell proliferation regulation and the relationship between DRG1 and tumor progression remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that DRG1 is elevated in lung adenocarcinomas while weakly expressed in adjacent lung tissues. DRG1 knockdown causes growth inhibition of tumor cells by significantly increasing the proportion of cells in M phase. Overexpression of DRG1 leads to chromosome missegregation which is an important index for tumorigenesis. Interestingly, ectopic of DRG1 reduces taxol induced apoptosis of lung adenocarcinoma cells. Mechanistic analyses confirm that DRG1 localizes at mitotic spindles in dividing cells and binds to spindle checkpoint signaling proteins in vivo. These studies highlight the expanding role of DRG1 in tumorigenesis and reveal a mechanism of DRG1 in taxol resistance.

27627778|t|Gelsolin in Onychophora and Tardigrada with notes on its variability in the Ecdysozoa
27627778|a|Rearrangements of the filamentous actin network involve a broad range of actin binding proteins. Among these, the gelsolin proteins sever actin filaments, cap their fast growing end and nucleate actin assembly in a calcium - dependent manner. Here, we focus on the gelsolin of the onychophoran Peripatoides novaezealandiae and the eutardigrade Hypsibius dujardini. From the cDNA of P. novaezealandiae we obtained the complete coding sequence with an open reading frame of 2178 bp. It encodes a protein of 726 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 82,610.9Da and a pI of 5.57. This sequence is comprised of six segments (S1-S6). However, analysis of data from TardiBase reveals that the gelsolin of the eutardigrade Hypsibius dujardini has only three segments (S1-S3). The coding sequence consist of 1119 bp for 373 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 42,440.95Da and a pI of 6.17. The Peripatoides and Hypsibius gelsolin revealed both conserved binding motifs for G-actin, F-actin and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), along with a full set of type-1 and type-2 Ca(2+) - binding sites which could result in the binding of eight and four calcium ions, respectively. Both gelsolin proteins lack a C-terminal latch-helix indicating a more rapid activation in the submicromolar Ca(2+) range. We suggest that a gelsolin with three segments was present in the last common ancestor of the ecdysozoan clade Panarthropoda (Onychophora, Tardigrada, Arthropoda), primarily because the gelsolin of all non-Ecdysozoa studied so far (except Chordata) reveals this number of segments. Mapping of our molecular data onto a well-established phylogeny revealed that the number of gelsolin segments does not correlate with the phylogenetic lineage but rather with particular functional demands to alter the kinetics of actin polymerization.

27628042|t|MiR-424-5p participates in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma invasion and metastasis via SMAD7 pathway mediated EMT
27628042|a|ESCC is a life-threatening disease due to invasion and metastasis in the early stage. Great efforts had been made to detect the molecular mechanisms which led to the invasion and metastasis in ESCC. Recent evidence had suggested that deregulation of miR-424-5p took an important role in cancers. However, its role and functional mechanism in ESCC had seldom been elucidated. The expression levels of miR-424-5p were detected in ESCC tissues and cell lines by real-time PCR methods. Then, the invasion, metastasis and proliferation ability of ESCC cell lines transfected with miR-424-5p mimics were analyzed separately by transwell invasion assay, wound healing assay and cell proliferation assay. Finally, the target gene of miR-424-5p was studied and verified by luciferase activity assay. And the role of miR-424-5p in EMT was also investigated by real-time PCR and western blot assay. We showed that the expression levels of miR-424-5p were decreased both in ESCC tissues and cell lines. Furthermore, the expression levels of miR-424-5p were negatively linked to lymph node metastasis in ESCC tissues. Restoration of miR-424-5p in EC-1 cells by using miR-424-5p mimics could decrease the invasion, metastasis and proliferation of EC-1 cells, indicating its role in inhibition on the invasion and metastasis ability of ESCC cells and tissues. In addition, we demonstrated that SMAD7 was a specific target gene for miR-424-5p by luciferase activity assay and miR-424-5p could not only negatively regulate SMAD7 expression but also participate in EMT via SMAD7, because overexpression of SMAD7 could partly enhance the miR-424-5p anti-EMT function. Our results described that miR-424-5p - SMAD7 pathway contributed to ESCC invasion and metastasis and up-regulation of miR-424-5p perhaps provided a strategy for preventing tumor invasion, metastasis.

27628933|t|Double-Network Hydrogel with Tunable Mechanical Performance and Biocompatibility for the Fabrication of Stem Cells - Encapsulated Fibers and 3D Assemble
27628933|a|Fabrication of cell - encapsulated fibers could greatly contribute to tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. However, existing methods suffered from not only unavoidability of cell damaging conditions and/or sophisticated equipment, but also unavailability of proper materials to satisfy both mechanical and biological expectations. In this work, a simple method is proposed to prepare cell - encapsulated fibers with tunable mechanical strength and stretching behavior as well as diameter and microstructure. The hydrogel fibers are made from optimal combination of alginate and poly(N-iso-propylacrylamide)-poly(ethylene glycol), characteristics of double-network hydrogel, with enough stiffness and flexibility to create a variety of three dimensional structures like parallel helical and different knots without crack. Furthermore, such hydrogel fibers exhibit better compatibility as indicated by the viability, proliferation and expression of pluripotency markers of embryonic stem cells encapsulated after 4-day culture. The double-network hydrogel possesses specific quick responses to either of alginate lyase, EDTA or lower environmental temperature which facilitate the optional degradation of fibers or fibrous assemblies to release the cells encapsulated for subsequent assay or treatment.

27629246|t|Synchronous vitellogenin expression and sexual maturation during migration are negatively correlated with juvenile hormone levels in Mythimna separata
27629246|a|Annual migration of pests between different seasonal habitats can lead to serious crop damage. Reproductive immaturity is generally associated with the migratory process (oogenesis - flight syndrome), but the mechanism of reproductive development during migration varies unpredictably. Here, the vitellogenin gene (MsVg) and three key regulatory enzyme genes (MsJhamt, MsJheh and MsJhe) related to juvenile hormone (JH) synthesis and degradation were identified and characterized in Mythimna separata. The relative expression of MsVg varied significantly in response to seasonal changes and was significantly correlated with stages of ovarian development. The relatively low levels of JH titer did not differ significantly in male moths but slightly increased in female adults during the migratory season, which was consistent with changes in mRNA levels for MsJhamt, MsJheh and MsJhe. JH titer was negatively associated with relative seasonal levels of vitellogenin mRNA transcripts and with ovarian development in migrating M. separata. The synchrony of MsVg expression with sexual maturation highlighted the potential of MsVg transcript levels to serve as an index to monitor the adult reproductive status. In addition, the level of JH and sexual maturity were correlated with the extent of JH in regulating the MsVg expression and reproduction during seasonal northern and southern migration.

27631656|t|Functional Result After Cochlear Implantation in Children and Adults With Single-sided Deafness
27631656|a|Patients with single-sided deafness (SSD) suffer from reduced binaural hearing (i.e., sound localization and speech in noise discrimination). Cochlear implantation has recently been introduced for patients with SSD, as an alternative to hearing devices that employ contralateral routing of the signal. Application to children has also been started. We retrospectively analyze a case series of 4 children and 17 adults with SSD, treated with cochlear implantation. The outcome of adult patients was compared with a control group of 27 patients with bilateral profound hearing loss using a cochlear implant. During 12 months, the mean speech recognition score increased from 30 to 41% for monosyllabic words in adults, and from 58 to 89% for multisyllabic numbers. The cochlear implant (CI) improved hearing in noise in all SSD patients, as was demonstrated by a significant improvement of the speech reception threshold in different speech and noise configurations. Sound localization -correlated angle detection error improved with CI use at every time point. The maximum word recognition score for monosyllabic words in quiet correlated with the logarithm of the duration of deafness; improvement of the speech reception threshold and RMS angle detection error by the CI did not. All SSD patients benefitted from the CI in different hearing situations. Patients with SSD for a long period can improve after cochlear implantation.

27632714|t|CHOROIDAL VASCULARITY INDEX: A Novel Optical Coherence Tomography Based Parameter in Patients With Exudative Age-Related Macular Degeneration
27632714|a|To evaluate choroidal structural changes in exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) using choroidal vascularity index computed from image binarization on spectral domain optical coherence tomography with enhanced depth imaging. This prospective case series included 42 consecutive patients with unilateral exudative AMD. Choroidal images were segmented into luminal area and stromal area. Choroidal vascularity index was defined as the ratio of luminal area to total choroid area. Mean choroidal vascularity index and mean choroidal thickness between study and fellow eyes of the same patient with dry AMD were compared using Student's t-test. There was a significantly lower choroidal vascularity index in eyes with exudative AMD (60.14 ± 4.55 vs. 62.75 ± 4.82, P < 0.01). Luminal area (P < 0.01) was decreased in eyes with exudative AMD but there was no significant difference in total choroid area (P = 0.05) and choroidal thickness (P = 0.93) between study and fellow eyes. Eyes with exudative AMD demonstrated reduced choroidal vascularity index but insignificant differences in choroidal thickness compared with their fellow eyes. Choroidal vascularity index may be a potential noninvasive tool for studying structural changes in choroid and monitoring choroidal disease in exudative AMD.

27632886|t|Comparison of Esophageal, Rectal, and Gastrointestinal Temperatures During Passive Rest After Exercise in The Heat: The Influence of Hydration
27632886|a|It is unknown how valid esophageal, rectal, and gastrointestinal temperatures (TES, TRE, and TGI) compare after exercise-induced hyperthermia in various hydration states. The purpose of this study was to examine the differences between TES, TRE, and TGI during passive rest following exercise-induced hyperthermia under two different hydration states: euhydrated (EU) and hypohydrated (HY). Randomized-crossover design. Controlled laboratory setting. Nine recreationally active male participants (mean± SD; age, 24±4; height, 177.3±9.9cm; body mass, 76.7±11.6kg; body fat, 14.7±5.8%). Participants completed two trials (EU and HY) consisting of a bout of treadmill exercise (a 10 minute walk ranging 4.8-7.2km·hr(-1) at a 5% grade followed by a 20 minute jog ranging 8.0-12.1km·hr(-1) at a 1% grade) in a hot environment (ambient temperature, 39.3±1.0°C; relative humidity, 37.6±6.0%; wet bulb globe temperature, 31.3±1.5°C) followed by passive rest. Root mean squared difference (RMSD) was used to compare the variance of temperature readings at corresponding time points for TRE vs TGI, TRE vs TES, and TGI vs TES in EU and HY. RMSD values were compared using three-way repeated measures ANOVA. Post hoc analysis of significant main effects was done using Tukey's HSD with significance set at p<0.05. RMSD values (°C) for all device comparisons were significantly different in EU (TRE - TGI, 0.11±0.12; TRE - TES, 1.58±1.01; TGI - TES, 2.04±1.19) than HY (TRE - TGI, 0.22±0.28; TRE - TES, 1.27±0.61; TGI - TES, 1.16±0.76) (p<0.01). Across the 45- minute bout of passive rest, there were no differences in TRE, TGI and TES between EU and HY trials (p=0.468). During passive rest after exercise in the heat, TRE and TGI were in good agreement when tracking body temperature, with a better agreement appearing in those maintaining a state of euhydration versus those who became hypohydrated during exercise; however, this small difference does not appear to be of clinical significance.

27633771|t|Annexin A1 restores Aβ1-42 -induced blood-brain barrier disruption through the inhibition of RhoA-ROCK signaling pathway
27633771|a|The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is composed of brain capillary endothelial cells and has an important role in maintaining homeostasis of the brain separating the blood from the parenchyma of the central nervous system (CNS). It is widely known that disruption of the BBB occurs in various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Annexin A1 (ANXA1), an anti-inflammatory messenger, is expressed in brain endothelial cells and regulates the BBB integrity. However, its role and mechanism for protecting BBB in AD have not been identified. We found that β-Amyloid 1-42 (Aβ42)-induced BBB disruption was rescued by human recombinant ANXA1 (hrANXA1) in the murine brain endothelial cell line bEnd.3. Also, ANXA1 was decreased in the bEnd.3 cells, the capillaries of 5XFAD mice, and the human serum of patients with AD. To find out the mechanism by which ANXA1 recovers the BBB integrity in AD, the RhoA-ROCK signaling pathway was examined in both Aβ42 -treated bEnd.3 cells and the capillaries of 5XFAD mice as RhoA was activated in both cases. RhoA inhibitors alleviated Aβ42 -induced BBB disruption and constitutively overexpressed RhoA-GTP (active form of RhoA) attenuated the protective effect of ANXA1. When pericytes were cocultured with bEnd.3 cells, Aβ42 -induced RhoA activation of bEnd.3 cells was inhibited by the secretion of ANXA1 from pericytes. Taken together, our results suggest that ANXA1 restores Aβ42 -induced BBB disruption through inhibition of RhoA-ROCK signaling pathway and we propose ANXA1 as a therapeutic reagent, protecting against the breakdown of the BBB in AD.

27634799|t|Association of kidney disease with obstructive sleep apnea in a population study of men
27634799|a|To determine the relationship between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Previous population studies of the association are sparse, conflicting and confined largely to studies of administrative data. Cross-sectional analysis in unselected participants of the Men Androgens Inflammation Lifestyle Environment and Stress (MAILES) study, aged >40 y. Renal data were available on 812 men without a prior OSA diagnosis who underwent full in-home polysomnography (Embletta X100) in 2010-2011. CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL/min/1.73m2 or eGFR ≥60 and albuminuria (albumin creatinine ratio ≥3.0 mg/mmol). CKD [10.5%, n=85 (Stage 1-3, 9.7%; Stage 4-5, 0.7%)] of predominantly mild severity showed significant association s with OSA (AHI≥10): odds ratio (OR)=1.9, 95% confidence interval (CI):1.02-3.5, severe OSA (AHI ≥30/h): OR =2.6, 95% CI:1.1-6.2, and respiratory related arousal index: ≥7.6/h OR =2.3, 95%CI: 1.1-4.7, but not measures of hypoxemia after adjustment for age, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, obesity, and NSAID use. There was no association of CKD with daytime sleepiness. In men with CKD, those with OSA were not significantly more likely to report symptoms (sleepiness, snoring, apneas) or be identified with the STOP OSA screening questionnaire, compared to men without OSA. Predominantly mild CKD is associated with severe OSA and arousals. Further population studies examining the longitudinal relationship between CKD and OSA are warranted. Better methods are needed to identify OSA in CKD which may have few symptoms.

27634880|t|Evidence that vitronectin is a potent migration-enhancing factor for cancer cells chaperoned by fibrinogen: a novel view of the metastasis of cancer cells to low- fibrinogen lymphatics and body cavities
27634880|a|Diluted (1%) plasma induces migration of malignant cell lines much more strongly than potent pro-metastatic factors. To characterize the factor(s) present in diluted plasma responsible for this phenomenon we performed i) heat inactivation, ii) dialysis, iii) proteinase K treatment, and iv) molecular size filtration studies. We found that this remarkable pro-migratory activity of diluted normal plasma is associated with a ~50-100-kD protein that interacts with GαI protein-coupled receptors and activates p42/44 MAPK and AKT signaling in target cells. Since this pro-migratory activity of 1% plasma decreases at higher plasma concentrations (> 20%), but is retained in serum, we hypothesized that fibrinogen may be involved as a chaperone of the protein(s). To identify the pro-migratory protein(s) present in diluted plasma and fibrinogen -depleted serum, we performed gel filtration and hydrophobic interaction chromatography followed by mass spectrometry analysis. We identified several putative protein candidates that were further tested in in vitro experiments. We found that this pro-migratory factor chaperoned by fibrinogen is vitronectin, which activates uPAR, and that this effect can be inhibited by fibrinogen. These results provide a novel mechanism for the metastasis of cancer cells to lymphatics and body cavities, in which the concentration of fibrinogen is low, and thus suggests that free vitronectin stimulates migration of tumor cells.

27636378|t|Development and initial validation of the Respirator Comfort, Wearing Experience, and Function Instrument [R-COMFI
27636378|a|Filtering face-piece respirators (FFRs) are worn to protect health care personnel from airborne particles; however, clinical studies have demonstrated that FFR adherence is relatively low in some settings, in part, due to discomfort and intolerance. The objective of this study was to develop and initially evaluate the psychometric properties of an instrument designed to measure the comfort and tolerability of FFRs. Instrument items were developed through literature reviews, focus groups, and several iterations of ranking and refining by experts. Psychometric evaluation of the instrument was conducted using Rasch partial credit model (PCM) analysis. Pivot anchoring was used to specify the threshold defining item difficulty; in our analyses, this was the point that participants moved from possessing none of the trait to some of the trait. The final instrument was completed by 165 health care personnel from 3 Veterans Health Administration facilities, and data were analyzed using Rasch PCM. Seven items were removed because they: (1) violated the assumption of independence; (2) were mis-fitting; and/or (3) were deemed not relevant. Category function analysis demonstrated that all categories progressed monotonically. Principal components analysis demonstrated the existence of three subscales (Discomfort, General Wearing Experience, and Function). Final reliability analyses showed that the scale had moderate to high person reliability and high item reliability. The final instrument contained 21 items. Until now, to our knowledge no instrument with evidence supporting its reliability and validity to assess discomfort and tolerance of FFRs among health care personnel has been published. A 21-item psychometrically sound measure of comfort and tolerability of FFRs, Respirator Comfort, Wearing Experience, and Function Instrument (R-COMFI), was developed. The significance of developing such an instrument is that it will help identify respirators that are likely to have better adherence in practice settings. The R-COMFI may be used within and beyond the VA healthcare system as a psychometrically sound instrument to evaluate the comfort and tolerability of respirators, including developmental prototypes.

27638250|t|Kidney transplant recipients after nonrenal solid organ transplantation show low alloreactivity but an increased risk of infection
27638250|a|The number of kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) after nonrenal solid organ transplantation (SOT) has increased to almost 5%. Knowledge on patient and allograft outcomes, infections, and alloreactivity, however, remains scarce. We studied 40 KTRs after nonrenal SOT. Seven hundred and twenty primary KTRs and 119 repeat KTRs were used for comparison. Samples were collected pretransplantation, at +1, +2, and +3 months post-transplantation. Alloreactive and CMV-specific T cells were measured by interferon-γ ELISPOT assay. Patient survival in KTRs after SOT, primary and repeat KTRs was comparable. While death -censored allograft survival was comparable between KTRs after SOT and primary KTRs, KTRs after SOT showed superior 5-year death -censored allograft survival of 92.5% compared to 81.2% in repeat KTRs. Interestingly, KTRs after SOT show less preformed panel-reactive antibodies, frequencies of alloreactive T cells, and acute rejections compared to repeat KTRs. KTRs after SOT, however, show higher incidences of EBV viremia and PTLD, sepsis, and death from sepsis. Impaired CMV-specific cellular immunity was associated with more CMV replication compared to repeat KTRs. Our results suggest comparable patient and allograft outcomes in KTRs after SOT and primary KTRs. The observed low alloreactivity may contribute to excellent allograft outcomes. Caution should be taken in KTRs after SOT regarding infectious complications due to overimmunosuppression.

27639061|t|Improved protocol for the isolation of naïve follicular dendritic cells
27639061|a|Follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) in lymphoid organs play an important role in the humoral immune response. However, because the isolation of FDCs is difficult due to their very small population size and fragility under mechanical and chemical stresses, the genetic and biochemical characteristics of FDCs remain unclear. Previously, we identified FDCs as ICAM-1(+) cells in the CD45 (-) non-hematopoietic cell fraction from naïve mouse spleen after cell separation by means of digestion with a combination of enzymes. In the present study, using a new combination of enzymes, we found that FDCs are highly enriched in the CD45 (-) ICAM-1(+) CD21 / 35(+) cell fraction. CD45 (-) ICAM-1(+) CD21 / 35(+) cells in the mouse spleen retained an antigen administered in vivo for more than 7 days. Moreover, CD45 (-) ICAM-1(+) CD21 / 35(+) cells isolated from the spleen of mice administered with a cognate antigen enhanced the survival and proliferation of antigen-specific B cells in vitro. Our improved protocol for the isolation of naïve FDCs will be useful for the analysis of FDCs in vitro and in vivo.

27643784|t|Dental enamel defects in German medieval and early-modern-age populations
27643784|a|Aim of this study was to investigate the frequency and type of developmental defects of enamel (DDE) in a medieval and an early-modern-age population from Thuringia, Germany. Sixty-six skeletons subdivided into 31 single burials (12(th)/13(th) c.) and 35 individuals buried in groups (15(th)/16(th) c.) were examined. DDE were classified on 1,246 teeth according to the DDE index. Molar-incisor-hypomineralisation (MIH), a special type of DDE, was recorded according to the European Academy of Paediatric Dentistry (EAPD) criteria. DDE was found in 89.4% of the individuals (single burials 90.3% and group burials 88.6%). Hypoplastic pits were the most frequent defect in primary teeth and linear enamel hypoplasia (LEH) in permanent teeth. 13 individuals (24.1%) showed at least one hypomineralised permanent tooth, 12.2% had MIH on at least one first permanent molar and 10.0% in permanent incisors. Second primary molars were affected in 8.0% of the children and juveniles. No individual suffered from affected molars and incisors in combination. Endogenous factors like nutritional deficiencies and health problems in early childhood could have been aetiological reasons of DDE and MIH. The frequency of DDE and MIH might have been masked by extended carious lesions, dental wear and ante-mortem tooth loss.

27644674|t|Breast Cancer Detection Rate, Incidence, Prevalence and Interval Cancer -related Mammography Screening Times among Thai Women
27644674|a|A recent guideline by the American Cancer Society recommended that mammography (MMG) should be done for women starting in their mid-40s. In Thailand, information on opportunistic mammography screening is limited and data on the total incidence of breast cancer are also lacking. The purpose of this study was to estimate the breast cancer detection, incident and prevalence rates among Thai women. We retrospectively reviewed the opportunistic mammography screening of normal women between 30 and 80 years who underwent the procedure between 2001 and 2010. All cases were followed until 2012. The detection rate was calculated for the whole period of observation using ' number of women with positive findings ' divided by ' total number of women screened '. The incidence rate was calculated only at the first MMG while the subsequence rate was calculated based on all new cases detected at each subsequent MMG. Among the 47,430 women, there were 152,091 MMGs or approximately 3.2 occasions per person (range, 1-10). The average duration of the interval between each subsequence visit was 1.8 years. Overall, breast cancer was detected in 543 women, with a detection rate of 10.3 per 1,000 persons. The prevalence rate of breast cancer at the first visit was 5.78 per 1,000 person s. The incidence or new cases detected at any follow-up visit was 10.4 per 1,000 person s. The overall interval cancer was 0.91 per 1,000 women, mainly detected before their second and third MMG, with a rate of 0.0.47 and 0.76 per 1,000 women. Opportunistic mammography screening in Thailand detected 10 cases of breast cancer from each 1,000 women. This paper indicated a high rate of cancer detection during a two year interval, hence, a screening mammogram should be performed more often.

27644855|t|Assessment of groundwater vulnerability in the Daule aquifer, Ecuador, using the susceptibility index method
27644855|a|The Guayas region in Ecuador is economically very important, producing 68% of the national crops. The main agricultural activities threaten the groundwater therein with nitrate contamination given the large fertiliser and water needs. The present work tests the applicability of the susceptibility index assessment method in evaluating the impact of agricultural activities on groundwater quality, using as a case study an aquifer of the Guayas river basin in Ecuador. The index adapts four parameters of the DRASTIC method and incorporated a new land use parameter. Results show that the areas highly vulnerable to contamination are located in irrigation perimeters of dominant paddy fields associated with the high recharge rates in the alluvial deposits. Respectively, moderately vulnerable and low - vulnerability areas correspond to aquatic environments and forests, semi-natural zones and water bodies. One of the main contributions of the Daule aquifer vulnerability is likely its wide, flat topography. A great part of the aquifer is at high risk of contamination by nitrates if a code of good agricultural practices is not applied. Therefore the implementation of a monitoring network to control the nitrates concentrations is the first step to assure groundwater quality for drinking purposes.

27645367|t|Heterogeneous depression trajectories in multiple sclerosis patients
27645367|a|Trajectories of depression over time may be heterogeneous in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients. Describing these trajectories will help clinicians understand better the progression of depression in MS patients to aid in patient care decisions. Latent class growth analysis (LCGA) was applied to 3507 MS patients using an electronic health records (EHR) data base to identify subgroups of MS patients based on self-reported depression screening (PHQ-9). Latent trajectory classes were used for group comparisons based on baseline clinical characteristics. Three subgroups were found characterized by high (10.0% [of participants]), wavering above and below moderate (26.2%) and low and variable (63.8%) depression level trajectories. The subpopulation trajectories, respectively, were also characterized by high, moderate and low MS disability at baseline. In contrast, the overall average trajectory was slightly declining and below the moderate depression threshold. The LCGA approach described in this paper and applied to MS patients provides a template for improved use of an EHR data base for understanding heterogeneous depression screening trajectories. Clinicians may use such information to more closely monitor patients that are expected to maintain high or unstable depression levels.

27646139|t|The PLA2 gene mediates the humoral immune responses in Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel)
27646139|a|The phospholipase A2 (PLA2) gene encodes the enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of phospholipids (PLs) from the sn-2 position. However, little is known about its role in humoral immune responses. In this study, we investigated the expression profile of PLA2 in different tissues and developmental stages in Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel), and the results showed that the transcriptional level of PLA2 was high in the egg and mature stage and in the testis tissue. Bacterial infection increased the expression of PLA2, and the highest degree of up-regulation appeared in the fat body. Silencing PLA2 influenced the expression of immune-related genes, including MyD88 and defensin in the Toll pathway and relish and diptericin in the Imd pathway. Moreover, the expression of MyD88 and defensin was down-regulated significantly in the ds-PLA2 group compared with those in the ds-egfp group when B. dorsalis was infected with L. monocytogenes and S. aureus, indicating that PLA2 was involved in the activation of the Toll pathway. Meanwhile, infection with L. monocytogenes and E. coli, which activate the Imd pathway, does not increase the mRNA levels of relish and diptericin in the ds-PLA2 group as severely as it increases those in the ds-egfp group, indicating that the Imd pathway was also repressed after silencing PLA2. Notably, the development of lipid droplets in fat body cells was influenced by silencing PLA2, implying that PLA2 affects the function of fat body tissue. These results suggest that the PLA2 gene may mediate humoral immune responses by reducing lipid storage in fat body cells in B. dorsalis.

27648744|t|Gambling disorders, gambling type preferences, and psychiatric comorbidity among the Thai general population: Results of the 2013 National Mental Health Survey
27648744|a|Background and aims To estimate the prevalence of problem and pathological gambling, gender and age-group differences in gambling types, and comorbidities with other psychiatric disorders among the Thai general population. Methods Analysis was conducted on 4,727 participants of Thailand's 2013 National Mental Health Survey, a multistage stratified cluster survey, using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Diagnoses of problem and pathological gambling and other psychiatric disorders were based on the DSM-IV-TR criteria with the following additional criteria for gamblers: more than 10 lifetime gambling episodes and a single year loss of at least 365 USD from gambling. Results The estimated lifetime prevalence rates of pathological and problem gambling were 0.90% [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.51-1.29] and 1.14% (95% CI: 0.58-1.70), respectively. The most popular type of gambling was playing lotteries [69.5%, standard error (SE) = 1.9], the prevalence of which was significantly higher among females and older age groups. The most common psychiatric disorders seen among pathological gamblers were alcohol abuse (57.4%), nicotine dependence (49.5%), and any drug use disorder (16.2%). Pathological gambling was highly prevalent among those who ever experienced major depressive episodes (5.5%), any drug dependence (5.1%), and intermittent explosive disorder (4.8%). The association between pathological gambling was strongest with a history of major depressive episode [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 10.4, 95% CI: 2.80-38.4]. Conclusion The study confirms the recognition of gambling disorders as a public health concern in Thailand and suggests a need for culturally specific preventive measures for pathological gamblers and those with a history of substance use disorders or major depression.

27649458|t|Synovial sarcoma of the hypopharynx in a pediatric patient: Case report
27649458|a|Synovial sarcoma (SS) is uncommon high grade soft tissue sarcoma, accounting for less than 10% of all head and neck sarcomas. Also, about 10% of SS occur within the Head & Neck. In the pediatric population, SS is an extremely rare head & neck malignancy. We present a case of sixteen years old boy diagnosed with SS situated of the hypopharynx treated by surgical excision and post operative radio - chemotherapy. This anatomical location brings additional functional challenges (swallowing, phonation, respiration), especially in the pediatric population. Pre-operative and even post-operative histopathological diagnosis of SS remains difficult. Optimal treatment of Head & Neck SS has to balance functional and oncologic aspects. SS is an extremely rare head & neck malignancy in pediatric population. It has multifaceted challenges including pre and post-operative histopathological diagnosis and optimal modality of treatment. Clinical judgment, especially in the pediatric population, needs to balance tumor free margins and organ preservation in head and neck region.

27649982|t|Ocular hypotensive effect of the novel EP3 / FP agonist ONO-9054 versus Xalatan: results of a 28- day, double-masked, randomised study
27649982|a|ONO-9054 is being developed for the reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with ocular hypertension (OHT) and open-angle glaucoma (OAG). This study compared the novel dual EP3 / FP agonist ONO-9054 with the FP agonist Xalatan. Adults (n=123) with bilateral mild/moderate OAG or OHT, with unmedicated IOP of ≥24 mm Hg at 8:00 hours, ≥21 mm Hg at 10:00 hours and ≤36 mm Hg, were randomised 1:1 to receive ONO-9054 (0.003%, 30 μg/mL) or Xalatan (0.005%, 50 μg/mL) once daily for 28 days. Day 29 mean diurnal IOP was -7.2 mm Hg for ONO-9054 vs -6.6 mm Hg for Xalatan. At 08:00 hours, the IOPs were comparable, and at all later time points the decrease in IOP was greater for ONO-9054. On day 29, the odds of a mean IOP reduction of ≤-25%, ≤-30% and ≤-35% for ONO-9054 were 2.39, 2.37 and 4.85 times more, respectively, than the odds for Xalatan (p<0.05, post hoc analyses). The percentage of subjects achieving target IOPs on day 29 (≤17, ≤16 and ≤15 mm Hg) was greater for ONO-9054 than for Xalatan; the odds of achieving an IOP ≤15 mm Hg for ONO-9054 were 2.4 times more than the odds for Xalatan (p<0.01, post hoc analysis). Subjects randomised to receive ONO-9054 were more likely to achieve a greater per cent reduction in IOP and were more likely to achieve target IOPs than those receiving Xalatan. The effects of ONO-9054 in reducing IOP appear to persist longer than those of Xalatan. NCT02083289, Results.

27650531|t|Whole-body strength training with Huber Motion Lab and traditional strength training in cardiac rehabilitation: A randomized controlled study
27650531|a|Isometric strengthening has been rarely studied in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), mainly because of possible potential side effects and lack of appropriate and reliable devices. We aimed to compare 2 different modes of resistance training, an isometric mode with the Huber Motion Lab (HML) and traditional strength training (TST), in CHD patients undergoing a cardiac rehabilitation program. We randomly assigned 50 patients to HML or TST. Patients underwent complete blinded evaluation before and after the rehabilitation program, including testing for cardiopulmonary exercise, maximal isometric voluntary contraction, endothelial function and body composition. After 4 weeks of training (16 sessions), the groups did not differ in body composition, anthropometric characteristics, or endothelial function. With HML, peak power output (P=0.035), maximal heart rate (P<0.01) and gain of force measured in the chest press position (P<0.02) were greater after versus before training. Both protocols appeared to be well tolerated, safe and feasible for these CHD patients. A training protocol involving 6s phases of isometric contractions with 10s of passive recovery on an HML device could be safely implemented in rehabilitation programs for patients with CHD and improve functional outcomes.

27653173|t|Percutaneous coronary intervention and heart surgery learning needs of patients in Jordan
27653173|a|This study aimed to identify and prioritize the perceived learning needs of patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention or open-heart surgery. Identifying learning needs for post-cardiac intervention patients is essential to establish successful health education programmes based on patient central care. A descriptive comparative design was employed on a convenience sample of 260 patients who underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention and 105 patients who underwent open-heart surgery patients. Participants had completed the Patient Learning Needs Scale. Data were collected between 1 October 2014 and 31 June 2015. Patients from the two groups highly requesting health and recovery related information. They scored all learning need topics as important or highly important for them. The top priority learning need for both patient groups was ' information about wound care ', and the lowest priority learning need topic was ' physical activity '. The learning needs of both groups were very close, which indicated that educational secondary prevention programmes ' content can be prepared in a unified structure for those patients. Although, specific headings can be used to address the unique needs that emerge from having a specific cardiac interventional procedure. The fact that wound care and medications are areas of highest learning needs for patients requires health policy decision makers to address these topics at the time of hospital discharge. In addition, a policy focus on considering patients ' actual learning needs requires establishment and managerial support. As patients ' learning needs might change later after discharge, the health services should be proactive and focus on continuous support for patients after hospital discharge. Secondary prevention programmes should incorporate health education topics based on patients ' own views. This can be done by giving higher priority to understand patients' needs, put much more effort into how to meet patients ' information needs and to create a more engaging learning environment for patients and their families.

27653736|t|Complications and Near-Miss Events After Hepatectomy for Living-Related Liver Donation: An Italian Single Center Report of One Hundred Cases
27653736|a|BACKGROUND In healthy individuals, such as liver living donors, potential complications may occur during surgery. Reporting such complications and near-miss events is mandatory to improve living donor management and safety. MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective study was performed on a prospective database with the aim of providing a brief analysis of the perioperative, medium-term, and long-term complications, and the near-miss events in a single center series of 100 consecutive liver resections for adult -to- adult living-donor liver transplantation. RESULTS Only 23.3% of potential living donors underwent surgery. No living donor mortality was reported; 29 patients (29%) experienced at least one complication. Five patients developed mild long-term dysfunction; two aborted hepatectomies, and there were two near-miss events reported. CONCLUSIONS A strategy for an accurate assessment of living donor complications and strict selection criterion cannot be overemphasized, as well as the need to continuously update center patient outcome reports.

27658531|t|Tooth wear as a means to quantify intra-specific variations in diet and chewing movements
27658531|a|In mammals, tooth function, and its efficiency, depends both on the mechanical properties of the food and on chewing dynamics. These aspects have rarely been studied in combination and/or at the intra-specific level. Here we applied 3D dental surface texture analysis to a sample of field voles (Microtus agrestis) trapped from Finnish Lapland at different seasons and localities to test for inter-population variations. We also explored intra-individual variation in chewing dynamics by analysing two facets on the second upper molars. Our results confirm that the two localities have similar environments and that the voles feed on the same items there. On the other hand, the texture data suggest that diets are seasonally variable, probably due to varying concentrations of abrasives. Lastly, the textures on the buccal facets are more isotropic and their direction deviates more from the mesial chewing direction than the lingual facets. We interpret these results as reflecting food, rather than chewing, movements, where food particles are more guided on the lingual side of the molars. This has implications for the application of dental microwear analysis to fossils: only homologous facets can be compared, even when the molar row seems to constitute a functional unit.

27659310|t|Human cathelicidin LL-37 enhance the antibiofilm effect of EGCG on Streptococcus mutans
27659310|a|Streptococcus mutans forms biofilms as a resistance mechanism against antimicrobial agents in the human oral cavity. We recently showed that human cathelicidin LL-37 exhibits inhibitory effects on biofilm formation of S. mutans through interaction with lipoteichoic acid (LTA), but without antibacterial or biofilm dispersal abilities. (-)-Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is the most abundant constituent of tea catechins that has the greatest anti-infective potential to inhibit the growth of various microorganisms and biofilm formation. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated whether LL-37 interacts with EGCG to enhance the antibiofilm effect of EGCG on S. mutans biofilm formation. Clinical S. mutans strains (n = 10) isolated from children's saliva were tested in a biofilm formation assay. The antibiofilm effect of EGCG with and without LL-37 was analyzed by the minimum biofilm eradication concentration assay and confirmed using field emission-scanning electron microscopy. In addition, the interaction among EGCG, LL-37, and LTA of S. mutans was determined using quartz crystal microbalance analysis. EGCG killed 100 % of planktonic S. mutans within 5 h, inhibited biofilm formation within 24 h, and reduced bacteria cells in preformed biofilms within 3 h at a concentration of 0.2 mg/mL. However, EGCG did not appear to interact with LTA. LL-37 effectively enhanced the bactericidal activity of EGCG against biofilm formation and preformed biofilms as determined by quantitative crystal violet staining and field emission-scanning electron microscopy. In addition, quartz crystal microbalance analysis revealed that LL-37 interacted with EGCG and promoted binding between EGCG and LTA of S. mutans. We show that LL-37 enhances the antibiofilm effect of EGCG on S. mutans. This finding provides new knowledge for dental treatment by using LL-37 as a potential antibiofilm compound.

27660855|t|Discovery of Orally Efficacious Phosphoinositide-3-Kinase delta Inhibitors with Improved Metabolic Stability
27660855|a|Aberrant signaling of phosphoinositide-3-kinase delta (PI3K-delta) has been implicated in numerous pathologies including hematological malignancies and rheumatoid arthritis. Described in this manuscript is the discovery, optimization and in vivo evaluation of a novel series of pyridine-containing PI3K-delta inhibitors. This work led to the discovery of 35, a highly selective inhibitor of PI3K-delta which displays an excellent pharmacokinetic profile and is efficacious in a rodent model of rheumatoid arthritis.

27665258|t|Mobile phone use, behavioural problems and concentration capacity in adolescents: A prospective study
27665258|a|The aim of this study is to prospectively investigate whether exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) emitted by mobile phones and other wireless communication devices is related to behavioural problems or concentration capacity in adolescents. The HERMES (Health Effects Related to Mobile phonE use in adolescentS) study sample consisted of 439 Swiss adolescents aged 12-17 years. Behavioural problems were assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), concentration capacity of the adolescents was measured by means of a standardized computerized cognitive test named FAKT. Cross-sectional and longitudinal (1year of follow-up) analyses were performed to investigate possible associations between behavioural problems and concentration capacity and different exposure measures: self-reported and operator -recorded wireless communication device use, cumulative RF-EMF brain and whole body dose and measured personal RF-EMF exposure. In the cross-sectional analyses behavioural problems were associated with several self-reported wireless device use measures but not operator -recorded mobile phone use measures, concentration capacity was associated with several self-reported and operator -recorded exposures. The longitudinal analyses point towards absence of associations. The lack of consistent exposure -response patterns in the longitudinal analyses suggests that behavioural problems and concentration capacity are not affected by the use of wireless communication devices or RF-EMF exposure. Information bias and reverse causality are likely explanations for the observed cross-sectional findings.

27665545|t|Twisting method for reducing friction during insertion of a sheath introducer and a sheathless guiding catheter
27665545|a|A sheathless system that inserts a catheter directly into the artery can reduce puncture site -related complications through a 2-Fr reduction of the outer diameter. However, the gap between the dilator and the guiding catheter of the sheathless system is larger than the gap between the dilator and sheath of the introducer system, resulting in stronger insertion resistance. A twisting method with rapid alternating rotation of a device to the left and right during insertion can reduce the insertion resistance. This method can be effective with the sheathless system which has a larger gap. To examine the effect of size reduction on the sheathless system and the effect of insertion resistance reduction using the twisting method, we developed an insertion simulator and compared insertion resistance to a 5-Fr sheath introducer and a 5-Fr sheathless system, with and without the twisting method. The insertion simulator pushed a sheath introducer or a sheathless system toward a mock artery consisted with a 5-mm urethane and a 1-mm rubber sheet by an electrical motor with or without twisting motion generated by a crank shaft. Insertion resistance during the penetration was measured by a tension meter. The insertion resistance was less with the 5-Fr sheathless system than with the 5-Fr sheath introducer. The resistance reduced further with use of twisting for both the sheathed and sheathless catheters. In conclusion, the experiment suggests the benefits of twisting insertion of a sheathless guiding catheter for reduction of puncture site -related complications.

27665550|t|Unconventional Protein Secretion in Plants
27665550|a|Unconventional protein secretion (UPS) describes secretion pathways that bypass one or several of the canonical secretion pit-stops on the way to the plasma membrane, and/or involve the secretion of leaderless proteins. So far, alternatives to conventional secretion were primarily observed and studied in yeast and animal cells. The sessile lifestyle of plants brings with it unique restraints on how they adapt to adverse conditions and environmental challenges. Recently, attention towards unconventional secretion pathways in plant cells has substantially increased, with the large number of leaderless proteins identified through proteomic studies. While UPS pathways in plants are certainly not yet exhaustively researched, an emerging notion is that induction of UPS pathways is correlated with pathogenesis and stress responses. Given the multitude UPS events observed, comprehensively organizing the routes proteins take to the apoplast in defined UPS categories is challenging. With the establishment of a larger collection of studied plant proteins taking these UPS pathways, a clearer picture of endomembrane trafficking as a whole will emerge. There are several novel enabling technologies, such as vesicle proteomics and chemical genomics, with great potential for dissecting secretion pathways, providing information about the cargo that travels along them and the conditions that induce them.

27670138|t|The ABBA study - approach bias modification in bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial
27670138|a|The core symptoms of bulimia nervosa (BN) and binge eating disorder (BED) are recurrent episodes of binge eating. Despite negative psychological and physical consequences, BN/BED patients show uncontrollable approach tendencies towards food. This cognitive bias occurs at an early stage of information processing. Cognitive bias modification (CBM) directly targets such biases and has been shown to be effective in treating several mental disorders. In alcohol addiction, automatic action tendencies towards alcohol cues and relapse rates were successfully reduced by a specific form of CBM, termed approach bias modification. Based on these findings and data from a proof-of-concept study in people with high levels of food craving, CBM is considered a promising new treatment approach for BN/BED. Given the similarities between BN/BED and addictive disorders, the rationale for using approach bias modification appears to be particularly strong. The aim of the present study is to examine whether, compared to a sham training, computerised approach bias modification (10 sessions) can reduce binge-eating episodes in BN/BED patients from pre-treatment to follow-up. Additionally, we will investigate whether this CBM programme also reduces global eating disorder psychopathology, trait and cue-elicited food craving, food intake as well as approach and attentional bias towards visual food cues. Treatment acceptance will be determined by attrition rates and responses on a feedback form. This is a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-group superiority trial with two parallel arms. A total of 54 BN/BED patients will be recruited. Approach bias towards food will be retrained by a computer task adopting an implicit learning paradigm. Patients in the control condition (sham) will conduct a similar task but will not be trained to avoid food cues. Methods against bias include public registration, randomisation by a central study office, standardisation of the treatments and blinding of assessors. Furthermore, the session number and duration will be equivalent in the two conditions. This is the first registered randomised controlled trial of approach bias modification in a clinical BN/BED sample. Results from this study will provide an indication of the efficacy of approach bias modification training for BN/BED and the potential mechanisms of action underlying this treatment.

27677517|t|Protein Design for Nanostructural Engineering: Concluding Remarks and Future Directions
27677517|a|This final chapter aims to summarize the main conclusions of the book and to point to possible directions for further research in the field of protein design for nanostructural engineering. Even though this research field is still at its infancy, multidisciplinary research efforts in the design of synthetic protein -based nanostructures and functional materials have resulted in significant progress. The chapters in this book cover several selected examples of the most recent advances concerning the use of proteins and peptides as building blocks for the fabrication of architectures and functional nanostructures, assemblies, and materials. Here, we provide a general overview of the strategies that can be employed to prepare functional protein -based nanostructures, and nanostructured materials and devices. Finally, we highlight some of the main aspects to be considered by the research community to set the path for the near future developments.

27677842|t|Synthesis, characterization and drug loading property of Monomethoxy-Poly(ethylene glycol)-Poly(ε-caprolactone)-Poly(D,L-lactide) (MPEG-PCLA) copolymers
27677842|a|Amphiphilic block copolymers have attracted a great deal of attention in drug delivery systems. In this work, a series of monomethoxy-poly (ethylene glycol)-poly (ε-caprolactone-co-D,L-lactide) (MPEG-PCLA) copolymers with variable composition of poly (ε-caprolactone) (PCL) and poly (D,L-lactide) (PDLLA) were prepared via ring-opening copolymerization of ε-CL and D,L-LA in the presence of MPEG and stannous octoate. The structure and molecular weight were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The crystallinity, hydrophilicity, thermal stability and hydrolytic degradation behavior were investigated in detail, respectively. The results showed that the prepared amphiphilic MPEG-PCLA copolymers have adjustable properties by altering the composition of PCLA, which make it convenient for clinical applications. Besides, the drug loading properties were also studied. Docetaxel (DTX) could be entrapped in MPEG-PCLA micelles with high loading capacity and encapsulation efficiency. And all lyophilized DTX -loaded MPEG-PCLA micelles except MPEG-PCL micelles were readily re-dissolved in normal saline at 25 °C. In addition, DTX -loaded MPEG-PCLA micelles showed a slightly enhanced antitumor activity compared with free DTX. Furthermore, DTX micelles exhibited a slower and sustained release behavior in vitro, and higher DTX concentration and longer retention time in vivo. The results suggested that the MPEG-PCLA copolymer with the adjustable ratio of PCL to PDLLA may be a promising drug delivery carrier for DTX.

27678317|t|Thyroid cancer burden in Central and South America
27678317|a|Incidence of thyroid cancer (TC) is rapidly increasing worldwide, but little is known about the TC burden in Central and South America (CSA). We describe the geographic patterns and trends of TC by sex in CSA. We obtained regional - and national-level incidence data from 48 population-based cancer registries in 13 countries and nationwide cancer deaths from the WHO mortality database for 18 countries. We estimated world population age-standardized incidence rates (ASRs) and age-standardized mortality rates (ASMRs) per 100,000 person - years. We calculated ASRs by histological subtype. We estimated the annual percentage change (EAPC) to describe time trends. Between CSA countries, TC incidence and mortality rates varied from 8-fold to 12-fold and from 2-fold to 5-fold, respectively. In 2003-2007, the highest TC ASRs in females and males were in Ecuador (16.0 and 3.5, respectively), Brazil (14.4 and 3.4), Costa Rica (12.6 and 2.1) and Colombia (10.7 and 2.5). The highest ASMRs were in Ecuador, Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Panama (0.68-0.91 in females and 0.41-0.48 in males). Papillary TC was the most commonly diagnosed histological subtype, following the same incidence pattern as overall TC. In Argentinean, Brazilian, Chilean and Costa Rican females TC incidence increased by 2.2-17.9% annually, and papillary TC increased by 9.1-15.0% annually, while mortality remained stable between 1997 and 2008. In males, trends in TC were stable. TC occurred more frequently in females than in males. The overall high incidence and low mortality of TC suggest identification of subclinical disease due to improved detection methods.

27679696|t|Histopathological Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Glycyrrhizic Acid as a Radioprotector Against the Development of Radiation-Induced Lung Fibrosis
27679696|a|Radiotherapy of the thorax often causes lung inflammation leading to fibrosis. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the use of glycyrrhizic acid (GLA) could improve the development of lung fibrosis in irradiated animals. Wistar rats were divided into four groups. Group A rats received thoracic irradiation. Rats in group B received GLA and irradiation. Group C received GLA and no irradiation. Group D received no GLA and irradiation. GLA was administered at a dose of 4 mg/kg body weight using an intraperitoneal injection one hour before thoracic irradiation. Radiation therapy was delivered on a Cobalt-60 unit using a single fraction of 16 Gy. The animals were sacrificed at 32 weeks following thoracic irradiation. The lungs were dissected and blind histopathological evaluation was performed. Histopathologically, a decrease (statistically not significant) in the thickening of alveolar or bronchial wall, formation of fibrous bands, and superimposed collagen were noted in the animals in group B as compared to the animals in group A. In this experimental study, administration of GLA one hour before thoracic irradiation may be a protective agent against radiation-induced fibrosis in animals and this model could be used in future studies.

27682280|t|Avulsions of Triceps Brachii: associated injuries and surgical treatment; a case series
27682280|a|This study reports the clinical presentations, intra -operative findings, type of the treatments, outcome of the treatment and specially associated injuries in patients with the avulsion of the distal end of the triceps brachii (TB) tendon. We studied 6 patients with rupture or avulsion of the distal end of the TB tendon. The medical records, imaging files, clinical outcomes at the final follow up visit were reviewed. The clinical outcomes were assessed by Mayo Elbow Score at the final follow-up visit. All patients were male, 4 of them having injury in the left hand as the non-dominant hand. Mean age of them was 34.5 years. All cases had small bony fleck in the posterior of elbow in lateral radiograph. Three patients had associated injuries -including intra-articular fractures and medial collateral ligament rupture. In one case V-Y plasty of the distal TB was done. In 4 patients the results of surgery were excellent, one was good and one was fair. Although TB tendon rupture is rare, it should be -considered in differential diagnosis of the upper -extremity trauma and its associated injuries should be addressed properly.

27683416|t|Prolyl-4-hydroxylase 2 and 3 coregulate murine erythropoietin in brain pericytes
27683416|a|A classic response to systemic hypoxia is the increased production of red blood cells due to hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-mediated induction of erythropoietin (EPO). EPO is a glycoprotein hormone that is essential for normal erythropoiesis and is predominantly synthesized by peritubular renal interstitial fibroblast-like cells, which express cellular markers characteristic of neuronal cells and pericytes. To investigate whether the ability to synthesize EPO is a general functional feature of pericytes, we used conditional gene targeting to examine the von Hippel-Lindau / prolyl-4-hydroxylase domain (PHD)/HIF axis in cell - expressing neural glial antigen 2, a known molecular marker of pericytes in multiple organs. We found that pericytes in the brain synthesized EPO in mice with genetic HIF activation and were capable of responding to systemic hypoxia with the induction of Epo. Using high-resolution multiplex in situ hybridization, we determined that brain pericytes represent an important cellular source of Epo in the hypoxic brain (up to 70% of all Epo - expressing cells). We furthermore determined that Epo transcription in brain pericytes was HIF-2 dependent and cocontrolled by PHD2 and PHD3, oxygen - and 2-oxoglutarate -dependent prolyl-4-hydroxylases that regulate HIF activity. In summary, our studies provide experimental evidence that pericytes in the brain have the ability to function as oxygen sensors and respond to hypoxia with EPO synthesis. Our findings furthermore suggest that the ability to synthesize EPO may represent a functional feature of pericytes in the brain and kidney.

27686752|t|Patient Satisfaction with Pharmacist -Led Collaborative Follow-Up Care in an Ambulatory Rheumatology Clinic
27686752|a|Patient satisfaction is known to increase with pharmacist intervention in general outpatient clinics and with nurse-led care in rheumatology clinics. The aim of the present study was to describe and compare patient satisfaction with two different types of care: a pharmacist physician collaborative model and a traditional physician model in a rheumatology clinic setting. A cross-sectional survey of inflammatory arthritis patients seen during a follow-up visit in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, was conducted over a ten-week period. Patient satisfaction was measured using a modified version of the validated Leeds Satisfaction Questionnaire, which uses a five-point Likert scale to measure six dimensions of satisfaction, and compared between the collaborative care and traditional physician models. A total of 62 patients completed the questionnaire (21 collaborative care and 41 traditional physician model). The average age of respondents was 52 years and the majority were female. The mean score for satisfaction across the six dimensions was 4.56 in the collaborative care group and 4.30 in the traditional physician group (p = 0.02). Patient satisfaction in the collaborative care group was consistently higher across all dimensions. No difference was noted between participants seen for the first time compared with those seen two or more times by the pharmacist. A collaborative care model can exceed the already high expectations for care of patients with inflammatory arthritis. Our findings support the role of pharmacists using a collaborative care approach to care for patients in rheumatology clinics.

27690050|t|Ontology -Based High - Level Context Inference for Human Behavior Identification
27690050|a|Recent years have witnessed a huge progress in the automatic identification of individual primitives of human behavior, such as activities or locations. However, the complex nature of human behavior demands more abstract contextual information for its analysis. This work presents an ontology -based method that combines low - level primitives of behavior, namely activity, locations and emotions, unprecedented to date, to intelligently derive more meaningful high - level context information. The paper contributes with a new open ontology describing both low - level and high - level context information, as well as their relationships. Furthermore, a framework building on the developed ontology and reasoning models is presented and evaluated. The proposed method proves to be robust while identifying high - level contexts even in the event of erroneously - detected low -l evel context s. Despite reasonable inference times being obtained for a relevant set of users and instances, additional work is required to scale to long-term scenarios with a large number of users.

27692572|t|Characterization of exposure in epidemiological studies on air pollution from biodegradable wastes: Misclassification and comparison of exposure assessment strategies
27692572|a|The assignment of exposure is one of the main challenges faced by environmental epidemiologists. However, misclassification of exposures has not been explored in population epidemiological studies on air pollution from biodegradable wastes. The objective of this study was to investigate the use of different approaches for assessing exposure to air pollution from biodegradable wastes by analyzing (1) the misclassification of exposure that is committed by using these surrogates, (2) the existence of differentia l misclassification (3) the effects that misclassification may have on health effect estimates and the interpretation of epidemiological results, and (4) the ability of the exposure measures to predict health outcomes using 10-fold cross validation. Four different exposure assessment approaches were studied: ammonia concentrations at the residence (Metric I), distance to the closest source (Metric II), number of sources within certain distances from the residence (Metric IIIa, b) and location in a specific region (Metric IV). Exposure-response models based on Metric I provided the highest predictive ability (72.3%) and goodness-of-fit, followed by IV, III and II. When compared to Metric I, Metric IV yielded the best results for exposure misclassification analysis and interpretation of health effect estimates, followed by Metric IIIb, IIIa and II. The study showed that modelled NH3 concentrations provide more accurate estimations of true exposure than distances-based surrogates, and that distance-based surrogates (especially those based on distance to the closest point source) are imprecise methods to identify exposed populations, although they may be useful for initial studies.

27692696|t|De Ritis Ratio (AST/ALT) as a Significant Prognostic Factor in Patients With Upper Tract Urothelial Cancer Treated With Surgery
27692696|a|We investigated the clinical prognostic value of preoperative De Ritis ratio (aspartate aminotransferase [AST]/alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) on postsurgical survival outcomes in patients with upper tract urothelial cancer (UTUC). We retrospectively analyzed the data of 623 patients who underwent radical nephrouretectomy for UTUC. Multivariate regression tests were performed to identify possible associations between adverse pathologic events and AST/ALT. The risk of postoperative progression and survival were tested using Kaplan-Meier analyses and Cox proportional hazards models. According to the receiver operator characteristic curve of AST/ALT for cancer-specific mortality, patients with AST/ALT value ≥1.5 were regarded as the high AST/ALT group, and the remaining patients formed the low AST/ALT group. In Kaplan-Meier analyses, the high AST/ALT group showed worse progression-free survival (PFS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (all P < .001). Elevated AST/ALT was associated with higher T stage (hazard ratio [HR], 1.577; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.077-2.311; P = .033) and higher cellular grade (HR, 1.538; 95% CI, 1.034-2.287; P = .041) in multivariate regression tests. In multivariate Cox analyses, high AST/ALT was revealed as an independent predictor of PFS (HR, 2.335; 95% CI, 1.633-3.340; P < .001), CSS (HR, 2.550; 1.689-3.851; P < .001), and overall survival (HR, 2.069; 95% CI, 1.409-3.038; P < .001). Elevated preoperative AST/ALT was a significant predictor of worse postoperative survival in patients surgically treated for UTUC. Further large prospective studies are needed for better understanding of the prognostic value of preoperative AST/ALT.

27693948|t|Molecular simulation study on concentration effects of rofecoxib with POPC bilayer
27693948|a|The interactions between rofecoxib and POPC (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) bilayer were studied using all-atom molecular dynamics simulation method. Four POPC bilayer systems with different number of rofecoxib molecules were constructed to simulate different drug concentration. The free energy of rofecoxib passing across pure POPC bilayer has two minima (at z ∼1.2nm or 1.6nm). As for the high concentration model, the minimum of the free energy profile slightly shifts to the bilayer center. Moreover, the energy change from bulk water to POPC bilayer increases while the central barrier to cross the hydrophobic core of bilayer slightly decreases, suggesting that increasing drug concentration makes it favorable for rofecoxib to partition into the bilayer and easier to pass across bialyer center. Energy analysis show that the stabilization between the selected rofecoxib and other pre-inserted rofecoxib molecule is mainly due to van der Waals interaction energy. The predicted permeability of rofecoxib in high concentration model slightly weakens as compared with low concentration model.

27694392|t|Short-term Variability of Vitamin D -Related Biomarkers
27694392|a|Quantifying the variability of biomarkers is important, as high within-person variability can lead to misclassification of individuals. Short-term variability of important markers of vitamin D metabolism is relatively unknown. A repeatability study was conducted in 160 Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study participants (60% female, 28% black, mean age 76 years). Fasting serum was drawn at 2 time points, a median of 6 (range 3-13) weeks apart. Vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] were measured by LC-MS, fibroblast growth factor (FGF23) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) by enzyme-linked immunoassay, and calcium and phosphorus by Roche Cobas 6000. Free and bioavailable 25(OH)D were calculated. We calculated the within-person CV (CVW), intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), Spearman rank correlation coefficient (r), and percent reclassified. The CVW was lowest for calcium (2.0%), albumin (3.6%), 25(OH)D (6.9%), VDBP (7.0%) and phosphorus (7.6%); intermediate for free 25(OH)D (9.0%) and bioavailable 25(OH)D (9.9%); and highest for PTH (16.7%) and FGF23 (17.8%). Reclassification was highest for PTH, VDBP, and phosphorus (all 7.5%). The ICC and r were highest (≥0.80) for 25(OH)D, free 25(OH)D, bioavailable 25(OH)D and PTH, but somewhat lower (approximately 0.60-0.75) for the other biomarkers. Six- week short-term variability, as assessed by CVW, was quite low for VDBP, calcium and phosphorus, but fairly high for FGF23 and PTH. As such, multiple measurements of FGF23 and PTH may be needed to minimize misclassification. These results provide insight into the extent of potential misclassification of vitamin D markers in research and clinical settings.

27695327|t|Fabrication of gelatin methacrylate / nanohydroxyapatite microgel arrays for periodontal tissue regeneration
27695327|a|Periodontitis is a chronic infectious disease and is the major cause of tooth loss and other oral health issues around the world. Periodontal tissue regeneration has therefore always been the ultimate goal of dentists and researchers. Existing fabrication methods mainly focused on a top-down tissue engineering strategy in which several drawbacks remain, including low throughput and limited diffusion properties resulting from a large sample size. Gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) is a kind of photocrosslinkable and biocompatible hydrogel, with the capacities of enabling cell encapsulation and regeneration of functional tissues. Here, we developed a novel method to fabricate GelMA / nanohydroxylapatite (nHA) microgel arrays using a photocrosslinkable strategy. The viability, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation and in vivo osteogenesis of human periodontal ligament stem cells (hPDLSCs) encapsulated in microgels were evaluated. The results suggested that such microgels provide great potential for periodontal tissue repair and regeneration. Microgel arrays were fabricated by blending different weight ratios of GelMA and nHA. hPDLSCs were encapsulated in GelMA / nHA microgels of various ratios for a systematic evaluation of cell viability, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation. In vivo osteogenesis in nude mice was also studied. The GelMA / nHA microgels exhibited appropriate microarchitecture, mechanical strength, and surface roughness, thus enabling cell adhesion and proliferation. Additionally, the GelMA / nHA microgels (10%/2% w/v) enhanced the osteogenic differentiation of hPDLSCs by elevating the expression levels of osteogenic biomarker genes, such as ALP, BSP, OCN, and RUNX2. In vivo ectopic transplantation results showed that GelMA / nHA microgels (10%/2% w/v) increased mineralized tissue formation with abundant vascularization, compared with the 1%, 3%, and the pure GelMA group. The GelMA / nHA microgels (10%/2% w/v) facilitated hPDLSCs viability, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation in vitro and further promoted new bone formation in vivo, suggesting that the GelMA / nHA microgels (10%/2% w/v) provide great potential for periodontal tissue regeneration.

27698544|t|Esomeprazole - or rabeprazole -based triple therapy eradicated Helicobacter pylori comparably regardless of clarithromycin susceptibility and CYP2C19 genotypes
27698544|a|The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of esomeprazole -based triple therapy compared with rabeprazole -based triple therapy according to CYP2C19 genotype and clarithromycin susceptibility status for first-line eradication therapy of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) in Japan. We enrolled 219 H. pylori - infected patients, and randomly allocated patients to the EAC group (esomeprazole 20 mg, clarithromycin 200 mg, amoxicillin 750 mg for one week, with all drugs given twice daily) or RAC group (rabeprazole 10 mg, clarithromycin 200 mg, amoxicillin 750 mg for one week, with all drugs given twice daily). The H. pylori eradication rate according to the PP analyses was 75.0% (95% CI: 65.2-82.8%) in the EAC group and 71.4% (95% CI: 61.4-79.1%) in the RAC group. There were no statistically significant differences. The eradication rates of the clarithromycin -resistant /- sensitive strains were, respectively, 45.0% (95% CI: 30.7-60.2%)/98.0% (95% CI: 88.7-100%) in the EAC group and 39.5% (95% CI: 25.6-55.3%)/93.5% (95% CI: 81.9-98.4%) in the RAC group. The eradication rate of the clarithromycin - sensitive strains was significantly higher than that of the resistant strains in both groups. In conclusion, EAC and RAC therapies show a comparable efficacy regardless of the CYP2C19 genotype and clarithromycin susceptibility status in Japan.

27698942|t|Optimization of Early Response Monitoring and Prediction of Cancer Antiangiogenesis Therapy via Noninvasive PET Molecular Imaging Strategies of Multifactorial Bioparameters
27698942|a|Objective: Antiangiogenesis therapy (AAT) has provided substantial benefits regarding improved outcomes and survival for suitable patients in clinical settings. Therefore, the early definition of therapeutic effects is urgently needed to guide cancer AAT. We aimed to optimize the early response monitoring and prediction of AAT efficacy, as indicated by the multi-targeted anti-angiogenic drug sunitinib in U87MG tumors, using noninvasive positron emission computed tomography (PET) molecular imaging strategies of multifactorial bioparameters. Methods: U87MG tumor mice were treated via intragastric injections of sunitinib (80 mg/kg) or vehicle for 7 consecutive days. Longitudinal MicroPET/CT scans with (18)F-FDG, (18)F-FMISO, (18)F-ML-10 and (18)F-Alfatide II were acquired to quantitatively measure metabolism, hypoxia, apoptosis and angiogenesis on days 0, 1, 3, 7 and 13 following therapy initiation. Tumor tissues from a dedicated group of mice were collected for immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of key biomarkers (Glut-1, CA-IX, TUNEL, ανβ3 and CD31) at the time points of PET imaging. The tumor sizes and mouse weights were measured throughout the study. The tumor uptake (ID%/gmax), the ratios of the tumor / muscle (T / M) for each probe, and the tumor growth ratios (TGR) were calculated and used for statistical analyses of the differences and correlations. Results: Sunitinib successfully inhibited U87MG tumor growth with significant differences in the tumor size from day 9 after sunitinib treatment compared with the control group (P < 0.01). The uptakes of (18)F-FMISO (reduced hypoxia), (18)F-ML-10 (increased apoptosis) and (18)F-Alfatide II (decreased angiogenesis) in the tumor lesions significantly changed during the early stage (days 1 to 3) of sunitinib treatment; however, the uptake of (18)F-FDG (increased glucose metabolism) was significantly different during the late stage. The PET imaging data of each probe were all confirmed via ex vivo IHC of the relevant biomarkers. Notably, the PET imaging of (18)F-Alfatide II and (18)F-FMISO was significantly correlated (all P < 0.05) with TGR, whereas the imaging of (18)F-FDG and (18)F-ML-10 was not significantly correlated with TGR. Conclusion: Based on the tumor uptake of the PET probes and their correlations with MVD and TGR, (18)F-Alfatide II PET may not only monitor the early response but also precisely predict the therapeutic efficacy of the multi-targeted, anti-angiogenic drug sunitinib in U87MG tumors. In conclusion, it is feasible to optimize the early response monitoring and efficacy prediction of cancer AAT using noninvasive PET molecular imaging strategies of multifactorial bioparameters, such as angiogenesis imaging with (18)F-Alfatide II, which represents an RGD -based probe.

27704589|t|Identifying research priorities with nurses at a tertiary children's hospital in the United Kingdom
27704589|a|The objective of this study was to undertake a research priority setting exercise with the aim of maximizing efficiency and impact in research activity undertaken by nurses at one children's tertiary healthcare institution by ensuring the clinical staff directly shaped a coherent, transparent and consensus driven nurse-led research agenda. In Round 1, the research topics of 147 nurses were elicited using a modified nominal group technique as the consensus method. The number of participants in the 24 separate discussions ranged from 3 to 21, generating lists of between 6 and 23 topics. In Round 2, nurses from the clinical areas ranked topics of importance resulting in a set of four to five priorities. In Round 3, the divisional heads of nursing consulted with staff in all of their clinical areas to each finalize their five divisional priorities. The Nursing Research Working Group discussed and refined the divisions' priorities and voted on the final list to agree the top five research priorities for the organization. A total of 269 research topics were initially generated. Following three rounds of ranking and prioritizing, five priorities were agreed at Divisional level, and from these, the five top organizational priorities were selected. These were (i) understanding and improving all aspects of the patient journey through the hospital system; (ii) play; (iii) staff wellbeing, patient care and productivity; (iv) team work - linking to a more efficient service; and (v) supporting parents / parent pathway. Divisional priorities have been disseminated widely to clinical teams to inform a patient-specific nurse-led research agenda. Organizational priorities agreed upon have been disseminated through management structures and processes to ensure engagement at all levels. A subgroup of the Nursing Research Working Group has been delegated to take this work forward so that the agreed priorities continue to contribute towards shaping nurse-led research activity, thereby going some way to inform and embed an evidence-based culture of inquiry.

27705854|t|Accurate Lungs Segmentation on CT Chest Images by Adaptive Appearance-Guided Shape Modeling
27705854|a|To accurately segment pathological and healthy lungs for reliable computer-aided disease diagnostics, a stack of chest CT scans is modeled as a sample of a spatially inhomogeneous joint 3D Markov-Gibbs random field (MGRF) of voxel-wise lung and chest CT image signals (intensities). The proposed learnable MGRF integrates two visual appearance sub-models with an adaptive lung shape submodel. The first-order appearance submodel accounts for both the original CT image and its Gaussian scale space (GSS) filtered version to specify local and global signal properties, respectively. Each empirical marginal probability distribution of signals is closely approximated with a linear combination of discrete Gaussians (LCDG), containing two positive dominant and multiple sign-alternate subordinate DGs. The approximation is separated into two LCDGs to describe individually the lungs and their background, i.e., all other chest tissues. The second-order appearance submodel quantifies conditional pairwise intensity dependencies in the nearest voxel 26-neighborhood in both the original and GSS-filtered images. The shape submodel is built for a set of training data and is adapted during segmentation using both the lung and chest appearances. The accuracy of the proposed segmentation framework is quantitatively assessed using two public databases (ISBI VESSEL12 challenge and MICCAI LOLA11 challenge) and our own database with, respectively, 20, 55, and 30 CT images of various lung pathologies acquired with different scanners and protocols. Quantitative assessment of our framework in terms of Dice similarity coefficients, 95-percentile bidirectional Hausdorff distances, and percentage volume differences confirms the high accuracy of our model on both our database (98.4±1.0%, 2.2±1.0 mm, 0.42±0.10%) and the VESSEL12 database (99.0±0.5%, 2.1±1.6 mm, 0.39±0.20%), respectively. Similarly, the accuracy of our approach is further verified via a blind evaluation by the organizers of the LOLA11 competition, where an average overlap of 98.0% with the expert's segmentation is yielded on all 55 subjects with our framework being ranked first among all the state-of-the-art techniques compared.

27706190|t|Influence of Different Levels of Lipoic Acid Synthase Gene Expression on Diabetic Nephropathy
27706190|a|Oxidative stress is implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy (DN) but outcomes of many clinical trials are controversial. To define the role of antioxidants in kidney protection during the development of diabetic nephropathy, we have generated a novel genetic antioxidant mouse model with over- or under-expression of lipoic acid synthase gene (Lias). These models have been mated with Ins2Akita/+ mice, a type I diabetic mouse model. We compare the major pathologic changes and oxidative stress status in two new strains of the mice with controls. Our results show that Ins2Akita/+ mice with under-expressed Lias gene, exhibit higher oxidative stress and more severe DN features (albuminuria, glomerular basement membrane thickening and mesangial matrix expansion). In contrast, Ins2Akita/+ mice with highly - expressed Lias gene display lower oxidative stress and less DN pathologic changes. Our study demonstrates that strengthening endogenous antioxidant capacity could be an effective strategy for prevention and treatment of DN.

27706588|t|Assessment of genetic relationship among Rhododendron cultivars using amplified fragment length polymorphism and inter-simple sequence repeat markers
27706588|a|Genetic relationships of 17 Rhododendron cultivars, China, were assessed using inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. A total of 133 bands were obtained using nine selected ISSR primers, 129 (96.99%) of which were polymorphic; 267 bands were amplified by four AFLP primer pairs, 251 (94.01%) of which exhibited polymorphism. Based on these polymorphic products, a cluster analysis revealed similarities between the results of the ISSR and AFLP. All of the cultivars were clustered into two major branches; one branch contained the same four cultivars, and the other cultivars were separated into different groups in the other branch. The cluster results showed that the genetic relationships of the 17 cultivars were partly related to their morphological characteristics, particularly the flowering phase. Therefore, the results of this study support the classification of Rhododendron cultivars according to flowering phase. In addition, the cluster results can be used to select suitable parents for breeding.

27707812|t|Spontaneous activity is correlated with coding density in primary auditory cortex
27707812|a|Sensory neurons across sensory modalities and specific processing areas have diverse levels of spontaneous firing rates (SFRs) in the absence of sensory stimuli. However, the functional significance of this spontaneous activity is not well-understood. Previous studies in the auditory system have demonstrated that different levels of spontaneous activity are correlated with a variety of physiological and anatomic properties, suggesting that neurons with differing SFRs make unique contributions to the encoding of auditory stimuli. Additionally, altered SFRs are a correlate of tinnitus, arising in several auditory areas after exposure to ototoxic substances and noise trauma. In this study, we recorded single-unit activity from primary auditory cortex of awake marmoset monkeys while delivering wide-band random-spectrum stimuli and white Gaussian noise (WGN) to examine any divergences in stimulus encoding properties across SFR classes. We found that higher levels of spontaneous activity were associated with both higher levels of activation relative to suppression across a variety of wide-band stimuli and higher driven rates in response to WGN. Moreover, response latencies to WGN were negatively correlated with the level of activation in response to both stimulus types. These findings are consistent with a novel view of the role spontaneous spiking may play during normal stimulus processing in primary auditory cortex and how it may malfunction in cases of tinnitus.

27708057|t|Systematic mapping of functional enhancer - promoter connections with CRISPR interference
27708057|a|Gene expression in mammals is regulated by noncoding elements that can affect physiology and disease, yet the functions and target genes of most noncoding elements remain unknown. We present a high-throughput approach that uses clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) interference (CRISPRi) to discover regulatory elements and identify their target genes. We assess >1 megabase of sequence in the vicinity of two essential transcription factors, MYC and GATA1, and identify nine distal enhancers that control gene expression and cellular proliferation. Quantitative features of chromatin state and chromosome conformation distinguish the seven enhancers that regulate MYC from other elements that do not, suggesting a strategy for predicting enhancer - promoter connectivity. This CRISPRi -based approach can be applied to dissect transcriptional networks and interpret the contributions of noncoding genetic variation to human disease.

27710899|t|Proliferation -enhancing effects of gastrodin on RSC96 Schwann cells by regulating ERK1 / 2 and PI3K signaling pathways
27710899|a|The proliferation and migration of Schwann cells (SCs) are essential in the process of peripheral nerve repair. A large amount of studies focused on the promotion of the growth of SCs for cell based therapy. Gastrodin (GAS), the main constituent of a Chinese traditional herbal medicine named Gastrodia elata Blume, has been reported to be associated with neuroprotective properties. Besides, GAS activated MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways which are often involved in growth of nerve cells were also reported. Based on the hypothesis that GAS may have an effect on SCs growth, we studied the effect of GAS on rat RSC96 Schwann cells (SCs) and further explored the underlying mechanism. Various concentration of GAS (0μM, 50μM, 100μM, and 200μM) was used for treatment of RSC96 SCs, with the cell proliferation and gene expression of several neurotrophic factors to be detected. Regulation of MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways were assayed by detecting phosphorylation of ERK1 / 2 and Akt. The results showed that GAS could effectively promote proliferation of RSC96 SCs in a dose - and time -dependent manner. The best performance was obtained at the concentration of 200μM. Exploration of the underlying mechanism showed that GAS probably affects SCs metabolism through inhibiting ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation and activating Akt phosphorylation in RSC96 SCs. This study may provide reference for its application in treatment of peripheral nerve injuries.

27713074|t|An influenza A virus (H7N9) anti-neuraminidase monoclonal antibody with prophylactic and therapeutic activity in vivo
27713074|a|Zoonotic A(H7N9) avian influenza viruses emerged in China in 2013 and continue to be a threat to human public health, having infected over 800 individuals with a mortality rate approaching 40%. Treatment options for people infected with A(H7N9) include the use of neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors. However, like other influenza viruses, A(H7N9) can become resistant to these drugs. The use of monoclonal antibodies is a rapidly developing strategy for controlling influenza virus infection. Here we generated a murine monoclonal antibody (3c10-3) directed against the NA of A(H7N9) and show that prophylactic systemic administration of 3c10-3 fully protected mice from lethal challenge with wild-type A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9). Further, post- infection treatment with a single systemic dose of 3c10-3 at either 24, 48 or 72 h post A(H7N9) challenge resulted in both dose - and time - dependent protection of up to 100% of mice, demonstrating therapeutic potential for 3c10-3. Epitope mapping revealed that 3c10-3 binds near the enzyme active site of NA, and functional characterization showed that 3c10-3 inhibits the enzyme activity of NA and restricts the cell -to- cell spread of the virus in cultured cells. Affinity analysis also revealed that 3c10-3 binds equally well to recombinant NA of wild-type A/Anhui/1/2013 and to a variant NA carrying a R289K mutation known to infer NAI resistance. These results suggest that 3c10-3 has the potential to be used as a therapeutic to treat A(H7N9) infections either as an alternative to, or in combination with, current NA antiviral inhibitors.

27714497|t|Mechanisms of ear trauma and reconstructive techniques in 105 consecutive patients
27714497|a|Acquired auricular deformities may diminish facial esthetics and cause psychological distress. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of the type of injuries and applied reconstructive techniques in a large academic hospital in The Netherlands. A retrospective chart review was conducted for the last 105 patients who underwent auricular reconstruction for an acquired deformity. Data concerning gender, affected side, cause of injury, anatomical region, the previous and further surgeries, type of cartilage, and skin cover used were collected and analyzed. 105 patients were included. Acquired auricular deformities were mainly caused by bite injuries (22 %), traffic accidents (17 %), burns (9.5 %), and post-otoplasty complications (9.5 %). The upper third of the auricle was most often injured (41 %), followed by the entire auricle (19 %). 70 % of cases required reconstruction with costal cartilage. The most common form of cutaneous cover was a postauricular skin flap (40 % of cases). This study gives a complete overview of causes and treatment of acquired auricular deformities. The results are comparable with the results of similar studies found in literature. Bite wounds are the leading cause of acquired auricular injuries. The upper third is most commonly affected. In the largest percentage of reconstructions, costal cartilage and a postauricular flap were used to correct the deformity.

27714730|t|Anatomic assessment of the left main bifurcation and dynamic bifurcation angles using computed tomography angiography
27714730|a|An understanding of the left main coronary artery (LMCA) anatomy is important for accurate diagnosis and therapeutic. We aimed to investigate LMCA anatomy via 128-multisliced coronary computed-tomography-angiography (CCTA) in patients with normal LMCA. A total of 201 CCTA studies were included in this study. Anatomical features of LMCA including cross-sectional areas of the LMCA ostial, LMCA distal, LAD ostial and LCX ostial, and degree of tapering and LMCA bifurcation angles (BA) in the form of LMCA - LCX BA, LMCA - LAD BA, LAD - LCX BA at end-diastole and end-systole. The mean age was 55 ± 11 with 55.7% males. RCA was dominant in 173 (86.1%) patients. Mean LMCA length was 10.0±4.5 mm. The mean values of LMCA ostial, LMCA distal, LAD ostial and LCX ostial areas were 18.2±5.1 mm², 13.2±4.0, 9.0±3.2 mm² and 7.6±2.8 mm², respectively. LMCA ostial - distal area, LMCA distal - LAD ostial area and LMCA distal - LCX ostial area ratios were ≥1.44 - <1.69 in 47 (23.4%), 53 (26.4%), 47 (23.4%) patients, respectively, and were ≥1.69-<1.96 in 19 (9.5%), 24(11.9%), 40(19.9%) patients respectively. Systolic motion modifies LMCA BAs; systolic motion begets an increment of LMCA - LAD angle in 72.6% of patients and decrement of LAD - LCX angle in 75.6% of the patients. Patients with T-shaped LAD - LCX BA was shown to have significantly longer LMCA, larger LAD ostial area, larger LCX ostial area and higher diastolic-to-systolic range (DSR) of LAD - LCX BA compared to patients with Y-shaped LAD - LCX BA. LMCA with T-shaped distal BA was found to have significantly longer LMCA, larger LAD ostial area, larger LCX ostial area and higher DSR of distal BA compared to patients with Y-shaped distal BA. These findings may provide useful information for LMCA bifurcation stenting or designing dedicated stents for LMCA.

27716187|t|A three perspective study of the sense of home of nursing home residents: the views of residents, care professionals and relatives
27716187|a|The sense of home of nursing home residents is a multifactorial phenomenon which is important for the quality of living. The purpose of this study is to investigate the factors influencing the sense of home of older adults residing in the nursing home from the perspective of residents, relatives and care professionals. A total of 78 participants (n = 24 residents, n = 18 relatives and n = 26 care professionals) from 4 nursing homes in the Netherlands engaged in a qualitative study, in which photography was as a supportive tool for subsequent interviews and focus groups. The data were analyzed based on open ended coding, axial coding and selective coding. The sense of home of nursing home residents is influenced by a number of jointly identified factors, including the building and interior design; eating and drinking; autonomy and control; involvement of relatives; engagement with others and activities; quality of care are shared themes. Residents and relatives stressed the importance of having a connection with nature and the outdoors, as well as coping strategies. Relatives and care professionals emphasized the role the organization of facilitation of care played, as well as making residents feel like they still matter. The sense of home of nursing home residents is influenced by a multitude of factors related to the psychology of the residents, and the social and built environmental contexts. A holistic understanding of which factors influence the sense of home of residents can lead to strategies to optimize this sense of home. This study also indicated that the nursing home has a dual nature as a place of residence and a place where people are supported through numerous care strategies.

27716352|t|Integrating one health in national health policies of developing countries: India's lost opportunities
27716352|a|Globally, the threat of infectious diseases, particularly emerging infectious diseases, originating at the human - animal - environment interface, has caught health systems off guard. With forecasts that future pathogen emergence will be centred in hotspots in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the need to prepare policy frameworks that can combat this threat is urgent. Emergence of diseases such as avian influenza and Ebola virus disease, which threatened social disruption, have established the need for intersectoral coordination/collaboration. These events led to the initiation of establishing institutionalised collaborative frameworks in India to adopt a One Health approach to disease prevention and control. However, the gains made in influenza control could not be adapted to other infectious diseases. Intersectoral coordination was briefly carried out, more as a reactive response to threats. The systemic failure to sustain such efforts have therefore, only undermined a coordinated response. The recent draft National Health Policy, 2015, has also failed to establish the need for intersectoral coordination in disease control approaches. Neglecting the need to endorse linkages between human health, animal health and husbandry, agriculture, and environmental sectors, has led to duplicative and weak response systems. The absence of health impact assessment with respect to the development agenda in policies, has cast negative effects on the health and wellbeing of man, animal, and the environment. Lack of attention to building core capacity in these critical sectors has further raised challenges in designing and deploying mitigation strategies. With developing countries like India being home to a major portion of the world's poorest livestock farmers, the absence of a policy discourse that endorses the One Health approach in development and health policies is a major hurdle in eliminating poverty and poverty - related diseases. The adoption of One Health approaches in health and related sectoral policies is a critical policy requirement for India and other developing countries. The goal should be to not just establish preparedness plans, but also to encourage a policy environment where assessment and mitigation of downstream impacts of different agenda are incorporated.

27717972|t|Assessment of demographic and pathoanatomic risk factors in recurrent patellofemoral instability
27717972|a|The WARPS/STAID classification employs clinical assessment of presenting features and anatomic characteristics to identify two distinct subsets of patients within the patellofemoral instability population. The purpose of this study was to further define the specific demographics and the prevalence of risky pathoanatomies in patients classified as either WARPS or STAID presenting with recurrent patellofemoral instability. A secondary purpose was to further validate the WARPS/STAID classification with the Banff Patella Instability Instrument (BPII), the Marx activity scale and the Patellar Instability Severity Score (ISS). A convenience sample of 50 patients with recurrent patellofemoral instability, including 25 WARPS and 25 STAID subtype patients, were assessed. Clinical data were collected including assessment of demographic risk factors (sex, BMI, bilaterality of symptoms, affected limb side and age at first dislocation) and pathoanatomic risk factors (TT-TG distance, patella height, patellar tilt, grade of trochlear dysplasia, Beighton score and rotational abnormalities of the tibia or femur). Patients completed the BPII and the Marx activity scale. The ISS was calculated from the clinical assessment data. Patients were stratified into the WARPS or STAID subtypes for comparative analysis. An independent t test was used to compare demographics, the pathoanatomic risk factors and subjective measures between the groups. Convergent validity was tested with a Pearson r correlation coefficient between the WARPS/STAID and ISS scores. Demographic risk factors statistically associated with a WARPS subtype included female sex, age at first dislocation and bilaterality. Pathoanatomic risk factors statistically associated with a WARPS subtype included trochlear dysplasia, TT-TG distance, generalized ligamentous laxity, patellar tilt and rotational abnormalities. The independent t test revealed a significant difference between the ISS scores: WARPS subtype (M = 4.4, SD = 1.1) and STAID subtype (M = 2.5, SD = 1.5); t(48) = 5.2, p < 0.001. The relationship between the WARPS/STAID and the ISS scores, measured using a Pearson r correlation coefficient, demonstrated a strong relationship: r = -0.61, n = 50, p < 0.001. This study has demonstrated statistically significant evidence that certain demographics and pathoanatomies are more prevalent in each of the WARPS and STAID patellofemoral instability subtypes. There was no difference in quality-of-life or activity level between the subtypes. The WARPS/STAID score demonstrated convergent validity to the ISS and divergent validity to the BPII score and the Marx activity scale. This study has further validated both the WARPS/STAID classification and the ISS of patients that present with recurrent patellofemoral instability. III.

27718023|t|Expression of caspase 3 in ovarian follicle cells of the lizard Podarcis sicula
27718023|a|In this study, our aim was to determine whether caspase 3 plays a role, during previtellogenesis, in the ovarian follicular epithelium of the lizard Podarcis sicula. We investigated the presence and localization of proform and active caspase 3 by enzyme assay, Western blotting and immunocytochemistry. In parallel, a fragment of caspase 3 was cloned for the first time in this species, sequenced and used for in situ hybridization to localize messengers and analysed by a phylogenetic survey to shed light on its homology with reptilian caspases. Results demonstrated that: (1) the follicle cells expressed a caspase of the 3/7 group and the mRNA for caspase 3 was transcribed in the stem phase and was completely translated during cell differentiation; (2) the proform protein was stored during the differentiated (nurse) stage and activated at the end of previtellogenesis provoking the degeneration of cells; (3) the predicted protein sequence, although partial, had a strong similarity with the known reptilian caspases 3. The epithelial cells of the ovarian follicle, therefore, do not employ caspase 3 during the nurse stage but, instead, prepare for apoptosis long before the process actually begins. The relevance of this strategy is discussed.

27720129|t|Increased acute mortality with chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced head and neck cancer in patients ≥70 years
27720129|a|Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is the standard of care for many sites of locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (LAHNC). However, on meta-analysis, the addition of chemotherapy did not improve survival for patients >70 years. We hypothesized that elderly patients treated with CRT would have increased toxicity without similar improvements in survival. A single-institution, IRB-approved retrospective study took place from 2005 to 2012 including 369 patients treated with CRT for LAHNC. Multivariate models for death at 3 months and death over time were developed using logistic regression and Cox modeling, respectively. Patients ≥70 years were treated less often with concurrent cisplatin dosed every 3 weeks (25.5% vs. 71.4%, respectively) and more often with weekly carboplatin (31.9% vs. 3.4%) than patients <70 years (n=322; p<0.001). Patients ≥70 years experienced increased toxicity during treatment with more frequently hospitalizations (36.2% vs. 21.1%; p=0.02) and a lower rate of PEG removal at last follow-up or death (77.1% vs. 92.9%; p=0.004). A higher proportion of patients ≥70 years died within 3 months (12.8% vs. 2.8%; p=0.001) following CRT. Patients ≥70 had an increased risk of death at 3 months following CRT (odds ratio 5.19, 95% CI 1.64-16.41; p=0.005) and worse survival over time (hazard ratio 2.30, 95% CI 1.34-3.93; p=0.002). Patients ≥70 years were more often treated with less toxic chemotherapy, yet experienced higher rates of hospitalization during treatment and increased rates of acute mortality following CRT. The efficacy of chemoradiotherapy for elderly patients should be evaluated in a prospective setting.

27733749|t|Food security and the nutritional status of children in foster care: new horizons in the protection of a fragile population
27733749|a|The nutritional status of foster children, the quality of daily menus in group homes and the Food Security inside these organizations have been poorly studied and this study means to investigate them. A sample of 125 children, ranging in age from 0-17 years, among seven group homes (group A) was compared with 121 children of the general population we (group B). To evaluate nutritional status, BMI percentiles were used. Mean percentiles of both groups were compared through statistical analysis. Both nutritional and caloric daily distributions in each organization were obtained using the 24-hour recall method. A specific questionnaire was administered to evaluate Food Security. From the analysis of mean BMI -for- age (or height-for-length) percentiles, did not observe statistically significant differences between group A and group B. The average daily nutrient and calorie distribution in group homes proves to be nearly optimal with the exception of a slight excess in proteins and a slight deficiency in PUFAs. Moreover, a low intake of iron and calcium was revealed. All organizations obtained a " High Food Security " profile. Nutritional conditions of foster children are no worse than that of children of the general population. Foster care provides the necessary conditions to support their growth.

27734729|t|Incontinence -associated dermatitis: reducing adverse events
27734729|a|Incontinence -associated dermatitis (IAD) is a common problem in patients with faecal and/or urinary incontinence. Urine alters the normal skin flora and increases permeability of the stratum corneum and faecal enzymes on the skin contribute to skin damage. Faecal bacteria can then penetrate the skin, increasing the risk of secondary infection. However, IAD can be prevented and healed with timely and appropriate skin cleansing and skin protection. This includes appropriate use of containment devices. This article also looks at HARTMANN incontinence pads that have been developed to absorb the fluids that cause IAD and maintain the skin's acidic pH. The acidic pH of the skin contributes to its barrier function and defence against infection. Therefore, maintaining an acidic pH will help protect the skin from damage.

27740919|t|Feasibility of a transition intervention aimed at adolescents with chronic illness
27740919|a|International guidelines recommend planned and structured transition programmes for adolescents with chronic illness because inadequate transition may lead to poor disease control and risk of lacking outpatient follow-up. To investigate the feasibility of a transition intervention aimed at adolescents with chronic illness focusing on declines, drop-outs, no-shows and advantages and disadvantages of participating. We invited 236 adolescents (12-20 years) with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) to participate in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) transition intervention. Reasons for decline and drop-outs were calculated. Adolescents ' experiences of advantages and disadvantages of participating and reasons for no-shows were investigated through focus groups and telephone interviews, which were analysed using thematic analysis. One hundred and twenty of the 236 eligible patients declined to participate in the intervention and 20% dropped out during the intervention. Unspecified declines and practical issues were the most common reason to decline, and ' do not wish to continue ' was the most common reason to drop-out. Reasons for no-shows were forgetting and being too busy. Advantages of participating were stated as ' participating without parents ', ' trust and confidentiality ', 'being able to set the agenda ' and ' responsiveness '. Disadvantages were ' unclear aim of the study ', 'meeting others with JIA ', 'too few conversations ' and ' transport issues '. Many adolescents had difficulties understanding the aim of the intervention. However, most participants appreciated the conversations about identity as well as the trust and confidentiality in the communication. In the future, adolescents should be offered more individually organised programmes according to their preferences and needs in cooperation with parents and health care providers.

27743356|t|High-Throughput Analysis of the IgG N-Glycome by UPLC - FLR
27743356|a|As biological and clinical relevance of glycosylation is becoming more apparent, interest in large scale studies of the glycome is growing. Glycans attached to immunoglobulin G (IgG) were shown to be essential for its function and IgG glycosylation was shown to change with various processes, making IgG one of the most studied glycoproteins. Many approaches including liquid chromatography, capillary gel electrophoresis, and mass spectrometry were developed to study IgG glycosylation. Generation of high-quality glycomics data in a high-throughput fashion requires reproducible and robust sample preparation and accurate and reliable quantitative analysis. This chapter presents a protocol for an optimized and high-throughput IgG N-glycan release, fluorescent labeling and cleanup, and analysis of fluorescently labeled IgG N-glycans by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) on an ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) system with fluorescence (FLR) detection.

27744219|t|Biomimetic whitlockite inorganic nanoparticles -mediated in situ remodeling and rapid bone regeneration
27744219|a|Bone remodeling process relies on complex signaling pathway between osteoblasts and osteoclasts and control mechanisms to achieve homeostasis of their growth and differentiation. Despite previous achievements in understanding complicated signaling pathways between cells and bone extracellular matrices during bone remodeling process, a role of local ionic concentration remains to be elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that synthetic whitlockite (WH: Ca18Mg2(HPO4)2(PO4)12) nanoparticles can recapitulate early-stage of bone regeneration through stimulating osteogenic differentiation, prohibiting osteoclastic activity, and transforming into mechanically enhanced hydroxyapatite (HAP)- neo bone tissues by continuous supply of PO4(3-) and Mg(2+) under physiological conditions. In addition, based on their structural analysis, the dynamic phase transformation from WH into HAP contributed as a key factor for rapid bone regeneration with denser hierarchical neo-bone structure. Our findings suggest a groundbreaking concept of ' living bone minerals ' that actively communicate with the surrounding system to induce self-healing, while previous notions about bone minerals have been limited to passive products of cellular mineralization.

27745773|t|Is the inactivation of dentin proteases by crosslinkers reversible?
27745773|a|Inactivation of dentin proteases by crosslinkers has been suggested as a way to prevent the degradation of dentin collagen in the hybrid layer. However, it is not known if the inhibition is reversible. The aim of this study was to evaluate the inactivation effect of various crosslinkers on dentin protease activity over a period of 6 months. Demineralized dentin beams (1×2×6mm, n=10/group) were treated with (1) 1% glutaraldehyde (GA1), (2) 5% glutaraldehyde (GA5), (3) 1% grape seed extract (GS1), (4) 5% grape seed extract (GS5), (5) 10% sumac berry extract (S), (6) 20μM curcumin (CR20), and (7) 200μM curcumin (CR200) for 5min. Untreated beams served as control. The beams were incubated up to 6 months and incubation media were used to analyze solubilized telopeptide (ICTP and CTX) fragments as indicators of MMP - and cathepsin K -mediated degradation after 1, 3 and 6 months of incubation. The relative MMP activity of dentin beams was tested using a generic MMP assay. Data were analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVA, α=0.05. All treated groups showed significant decrease in CTX release (32.2-469.5pg/mg dentin) and ICTP (1.8-47.6ng/mg dentin) fragments during the first month of incubation compared to control (1159pg/mg and 72.9ng/mg dentin, respectively). GA5, GS5 and CR200 maintained their inhibitory effect during 6-month incubation. The results were confirmed by dry mass loss and relative MMP activity following 6 months. The results of this study indicate that the long-term effect is both crosslinker and dose dependent.

27752082|t|Inhibition of STEP61 ameliorates deficits in mouse and hiPSC -based schizophrenia models
27752082|a|The brain - specific tyrosine phosphatase, STEP (STriatal-Enriched protein tyrosine Phosphatase) is an important regulator of synaptic function. STEP normally opposes synaptic strengthening by increasing N-methyl D-aspartate glutamate receptor (NMDAR) internalization through dephosphorylation of GluN2B and inactivation of the kinases extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 / 2 and Fyn. Here we show that STEP61 is elevated in the cortex in the Nrg1(+/-) knockout mouse model of schizophrenia (SZ). Genetic reduction or pharmacological inhibition of STEP prevents the loss of NMDARs from synaptic membranes and reverses behavioral deficits in Nrg1(+/-) mice. STEP61 protein is also increased in cortical lysates from the central nervous system - specific ErbB2 / 4 mouse model of SZ, as well as in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived forebrain neurons and Ngn2 - induced excitatory neurons, from two independent SZ patient cohorts. In these selected SZ models, increased STEP61 protein levels likely reflect reduced ubiquitination and degradation. These convergent findings from mouse and hiPSC SZ models provide evidence for STEP61 dysfunction in SZ .Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 18 October 2016; doi:10.1038/mp.2016.163.

27752744|t|Incident fracture associated with increased risk of mortality even after adjusting for frailty status in elderly Japanese men: the Fujiwara-kyo Osteoporosis Risk in Men (FORMEN) Cohort Study
27752744|a|Frail elderly individuals have elevated risks of both fracture and mortality. We found that incident fractures were associated with an increased risk of death even after adjusting for pre-fracture frailty status as represented by physical performance tests and laboratory tests for common geriatric diseases in community-dwelling elderly Japanese men. While fractures reportedly increase the risk of mortality, frailty may complicate this association, generating a false-positive result. We evaluated this association after adjusting for pre-fracture levels of frailty. We examined 1998 community-dwelling ambulatory men aged ≥65 years at baseline in the Fujiwara-kyo Osteoporosis Risk in Men Study for frailty status as represented by activities of daily living (ADL), physical performance tests (grip strength, one-foot standing balance with eyes open, timed 10-m walk), and laboratory sera tests. Participants were then followed for 5 years for incident clinical fractures and death. Effects of incident fracture on death were determined by Cox proportional hazards model with the first fracture during follow-up as a time-dependent predictor and with frailty status indices as covariates. We identified 111 fractures in 99 men and 138 deaths during the follow-up period (median follow-up, 4.5 years). Participants with incident fractures did not have significantly worse frailty statuses, but did show a significantly higher cumulative mortality rate than those without fractures (p = 0.0047). Age-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of death for incident fracture was 3.57 (95 % confidence interval: 2.05, 6.24). When adjusted for physical performance, this decreased to 2.77 (1.51, 5.06), but remained significant. The HR showed no significant change when adjusted for laboratory test results (3.96 (2.26, 6.94)). Exclusion of deaths within the first 24 months of follow-up did not alter these results. Incident clinical fracture was associated with an elevated risk of death independently of pre-fracture levels of frailty in community-dwelling elderly men.

27754397|t|Total Energy Expenditure in Obese Kuwaiti Primary School Children Assessed by the Doubly-Labeled Water Technique
27754397|a|The aim of this pilot study was to assess body composition and total energy expenditure (TEE) in 35 obese 7-9 years old Kuwaiti children (18 girls and 17 boys). Total body water (TBW) and TEE were assessed by doubly-labeled water technique. TBW was derived from the intercept of the elimination rate of deuterium and TEE from the difference in elimination rates of (18)O and deuterium. TBW was used to estimate fat-free mass (FFM), using hydration factors for different ages and gender. Fat mass (FM) was calculated as the difference between body weight and FFM. Body weight was not statistically different but TBW was significantly higher (p = 0.018) in boys (44.9% ± 3.3%) than girls (42.4% ± 3.0%), while girls had significantly higher estimated FM (45.2 ± 3.9 weight % versus 41.6% ± 4.3%; p = 0.014). TEE was significantly higher in boys (2395 ± 349 kcal/day) compared with girls (1978 ± 169 kcal/day); p = 0.001. Estimated physical activity level (PAL) was significantly higher in boys; 1.61 ± 0.167 versus 1.51 ± 0.870; p = 0.034. Our results provide the first dataset of TEE in 7-9 years old obese Kuwaiti children and highlight important gender differences to be considered during the development of school based interventions targeted to combat childhood obesity.

27755168|t|Mesenchymal stromal cells in clinical kidney transplantation: how tolerant can it be?
27755168|a|Progress in the improvement of short-term and long-term outcomes of kidney transplantation seems to have reached a plateau, partially due to consequences of very efficient, but nonspecific immunosuppressive drugs. In recent years, various forms of cell therapy, including the use of mesenchymal stromal cells, have been put forward as an alternative strategy for more defined therapy. It is thought that these therapies will not only allow controlled tapering of immunosuppressive medication, but might bring us also closer to the ambition of generating donor -specific immune regulation and tolerance. Different forms of alloimmunity, including direct, indirect and semi-direct alloantigen presentation have to be controlled before donor -specific immune regulation can be reached. Several mechanisms have been described how mesenchymal stromal cells can affect alloimmunity. Especially, the interaction with professional antigen presenting cells, like dendritic cells, is of critical importance. This review will discuss the current status of ongoing clinical trials with mesenchymal stromal cells in kidney transplantation and specifically concentrate on the possibilities and impossibilities of how these therapeutic strategies can contribute to control of the different forms of alloreactivity operation in organ transplantation.

27760552|t|Facilitating factors and barriers to malaria research utilization for policy development in Malawi
27760552|a|Research on various determinants of health is key in providing evidence for policy development, thereby leading to successful interventions. Utilization of research is an intricate process requiring an understanding of contextual factors. The study was conducted to assess enhancing factors and barriers of research utilization for malaria policy development in Malawi. Qualitative research approach was used through in-depth interviews with 39 key informants that included malaria researchers, policy makers, programme managers, and key stakeholders. Purposive sampling and snowballing techniques were used in identifying key informants. Interview transcripts were entered in QSR Nvivo 11 software for coding and analysis. Respondents identified global efforts as key in advancing knowledge translation, while local political will has been conducive for research utilization. Other factors were availability of research, availability of diverse local researchers and stakeholders supporting knowledge translation. While barriers included: lack of platforms for researcher - public engagement, politics, researchers' lack of communication skills, lack of research collaborations, funder driven research, unknown World Health Organization policy position, and the lack of a malaria research repository. Overall, the study identified facilitating factors to malaria research utilization for policy development in Malawi. These factors need to be systematically coordinated to address the identified barriers and improve on malaria research utilization in policy development. Malaria research can be key in the implementation of evidence-based interventions to reduce the malaria burden and assist in the paradigm shift from malaria control to elimination in Malawi.

27760700|t|Altered interregional correlations between serotonin transporter availability and cerebral glucose metabolism in schizophrenia: A high-resolution PET study using [(11)C]DASB and [(18)F]FDG
27760700|a|The purpose of the present study was to investigate the patterns of interregional correlations of serotonin transporter (SERT) availability with glucose metabolism using 7-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and high-resolution positron emission tomography (PET) with (11)C-3-amino-4-(2-dimethylaminomethylphenylthio)benzonitrile ([(11)C]DASB) and [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([(18)F]FDG) in antipsychotic-free patients with schizophrenia in order to shed new light on the disrupted functional connectivity in schizophrenia. Nineteen patients with schizophrenia and 18 healthy controls underwent high-resolution PET and MRI. The binding potential (BPND) of [(11)C]DASB and standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) of [(18)F]FDG were obtained. In SERT availability, the region of interest (ROI)-based analyses showed no significant group differences in any region, except for the anterior hippocampus where the SERT availability was lower in patients with schizophrenia than in controls. The ROI - and voxel -based analyses revealed that the [(18)F]FDG SUVR values were significantly lower in patients than in controls in the right superior frontal gyrus and medial part of the left superior frontal gyrus. Regarding the interregional correlations of [(11)C]DASB BPND with [(18)F]FDG SUVR, more widespread positive correlations across the brain regions were observed in control subjects than in patients with schizophrenia. Notably, the patients and control subjects showed statistically significant differences in correlations between the SERT availability in the parietal and temporal cortices and the glucose metabolism in the posterior cingulate cortex. These results suggest abnormal functional connectivity between the higher-order cortical regions in schizophrenia and a possible important role of the posterior cingulate gyrus and its related circuitry in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.

27761922|t|Urticarial exanthema due to hepatitis B in a pregnant woman, mimicking a polymorphic eruption of pregnancy
27761922|a|Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in pregnant women is very rare in western countries, thus, cutaneous manifestation of HBV infection may be confused with a dermatosis specific of pregnancy. We report a 39-year-old woman who presented in her 20th week of pregnancy with a pruritic rash, which consisted of generalized erythematous plaques, some of them with a purple centre. Serology testing showed acute HBV infection, and a biopsy revealed a superficial and interstitial perivascular inflammatory infiltrate of lymphocytes and eosinophils. A diagnosis of exanthema due to acute hepatitis B infection was established. The patient delivered a clinically healthy boy, who was given the first dose of the HBV vaccine and intravenous specific immunoglobulin, followed by the second dose 2 months later, and did not get infected with HBV. To our knowledge, this is the first case describing HBV exanthema in a pregnant woman, which led to early action for the newborn, avoiding vertical transmission and its high prevalence of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.

27764829|t|Determination of the Mutant Prevention Concentration and the Mutant Selection Window of Topical Antimicrobial Agents against Propionibacterium acnes
27764829|a|Determination of the mutant prevention concentration (MPC) and the mutant selection window (MSW) of antimicrobial agents used to treat pathogenic bacteria is important in order to apply effective antimicrobial therapies. Here, we determined the MPCs of the major topical antimicrobial agents against Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus aureus which cause skin infections and compared their MSWs. Among the MPCs of nadifloxacin and clindamycin, the clindamycin MPC was determined to be the lowest against P. acnes. In contrast, the nadifloxacin MPC was the lowest against S. aureus. Calculations based on the minimum inhibitory concentrations and MPCs showed that clindamycin has the lowest MSW against both P. acnes and S. aureus. Nadifloxacin MSWs were 4-fold higher against P. acnes than against S. aureus. It is more likely for P. acnes to acquire resistance to fluoroquinolones than S. aureus. Therefore, topical application of clindamycin contributes very little to the emergence of resistant P. acnes and S. aureus strains.

27765805|t|Total colectomy for colon perforation after kayexalate administration: a case report and literature review of a rare complication
27765805|a|Kayexalate is an ion exchange resin that is commonly used to acutely treat patients with hyperkalemia. Bowel ulceration and necrosis is a rare and uncommonly recognized complication of kayexalate administration. More often, concomitant administration with sorbitol is reported to damage the bowel; however, there are reports of kayexalate administration causing bowel necrosis without sorbitol. We present a case of a critically ill patient who underwent total colectomy for colonic necrosis secondary to oral kayexalate administration that was not recognized until late in the pathologic process. We also review the literature to further investigate this progression.

27766178|t|Total Arsenic, Cadmium, and Lead Determination in Brazilian Rice Samples Using ICP-MS
27766178|a|This study is aimed at investigating a suitable method for rice sample preparation as well as validating and applying the method for monitoring the concentration of total arsenic, cadmium, and lead in rice by using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). Various rice sample preparation procedures were evaluated. The analytical method was validated by measuring several parameters including limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), linearity, relative bias, and repeatability. Regarding the sample preparation, recoveries of spiked samples were within the acceptable range from 89.3 to 98.2% for muffle furnace, 94.2 to 103.3% for heating block, 81.0 to 115.0% for hot plate, and 92.8 to 108.2% for microwave. Validation parameters showed that the method fits for its purpose, being the total arsenic, cadmium, and lead within the Brazilian Legislation limits. The method was applied for analyzing 37 rice samples (including polished, brown, and parboiled), consumed by the Brazilian population. The total arsenic, cadmium, and lead contents were lower than the established legislative values, except for total arsenic in one brown rice sample. This study indicated the need to establish monitoring programs for emphasizing the study on this type of cereal, aiming at promoting the Public Health.

27768063|t|Safety Precautions and Operating Procedures in an (A) BSL-4 Laboratory: 1. Biosafety Level 4 Suit Laboratory Suite Entry and Exit Procedures
27768063|a|Biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) suit laboratories are specifically designed to study high-consequence pathogens for which neither infection prophylaxes nor treatment options exist. The hallmarks of these laboratories are: custom-designed airtight doors, dedicated supply and exhaust airflow systems, a negative-pressure environment, and mandatory use of positive-pressure ("space") suits. The risk for laboratory specialists working with highly pathogenic agents is minimized through rigorous training and adherence to stringent safety protocols and standard operating procedures. Researchers perform the majority of their work in BSL-2 laboratories and switch to BSL-4 suit laboratories when work with a high-consequence pathogen is required. Collaborators and scientists considering BSL-4 projects should be aware of the challenges associated with BSL-4 research both in terms of experimental technical limitations in BSL-4 laboratory space and the increased duration of such experiments. Tasks such as entering and exiting the BSL-4 suit laboratories are considerably more complex and time-consuming compared to BSL-2 and BSL-3 laboratories. The focus of this particular article is to address basic biosafety concerns and describe the entrance and exit procedures for the BSL-4 laboratory at the NIH / NIAID Integrated Research Facility at Fort Detrick. Such procedures include checking external systems that support the BSL-4 laboratory, and inspecting and donning positive-pressure suits, entering the laboratory, moving through air pressure - resistant doors, and connecting to air-supply hoses. We will also discuss moving within and exiting the BSL-4 suit laboratories, including using the chemical shower and removing and storing positive-pressure suits.

27768522|t|Masters Athletes: Exemplars of Successful Aging?
27768522|a|Global population aging has raised academic interest in successful aging to a public policy priority. Currently there is no consensus regarding the definition of successful aging. However, a synthesis of research shows successful aging can be defined as a late-life process of change characterized by high physical, psychological, cognitive, and social functioning. Masters athletes systematically train for, and compete in, organized forms of team and individual sport specifically designed for older adults. Masters athletes are often proposed as exemplars of successful aging. However, their aging status has never been examined using a comprehensive multidimensional successful aging definition. Here, we examine the successful aging literature, propose a successful aging definition based on this literature, present evidence which suggests masters athletes could be considered exemplars of successful aging according to the proposed definition, and list future experimental research directions.

27768814|t|Non-specific transient mutualism between the plant parasitic nematode, Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, and the opportunistic bacterium Serratia quinivorans BXF1, a plant-growth promoting pine endophyte with antagonistic effects
27768814|a|The aim of this study is to understand the biological role of Serratia quinivorans BXF1, a bacterium commonly found associated with Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, the plant parasitic nematode responsible for pine wilt disease. Therefore, we studied strain BXF1 effect in pine wilt disease. We found that strain BXF1 promoted in vitro nematode reproduction. Moreover, the presence of bacteria led to the absence of nematode chitinase gene (Bxcht-1) expression, suggesting an effect for bacterial chitinase in nematode reproduction. Nevertheless, strain BXF1 was unable to colonize the nematode interior, bind to its cuticle with high affinity or protect the nematode from xenobiotic stress. Interestingly, strain BXF1 was able to promote tomato and pine plant-growth, as well as to colonize its interior, thus, acting like a plant-growth promoting endophyte. Consequently, strain BXF1 failed to induce wilting symptoms when inoculated in pine shoot artificial incisions. This bacterium also presented strong antagonistic activities against fungi and bacteria isolated from Pinus pinaster. Our results suggest that B. xylophilus does not possess a strict symbiotic community capable of inducing pine wilt disease symptoms as previously hypothesized. We show that bacteria like BXF1, which possess plant-growth promoting and antagonistic effects, may be opportunistically associated with B. xylophilus, possibly acquired from the bacterial endophytic community of the host pine.

27771865|t|Habitual physical activity is associated with improved anthropometric and androgenic profile in PCOS: a cross-sectional study
27771865|a|To examine the effect of habitual physical activity (PA) on the metabolic and hormonal profiles of women with polycystic ovary syndrome. Anthropometric, metabolic and hormonal assessment and determination of habitual PA levels with a digital pedometer were evaluated in 84 women with PCOS and 67 age- and body mass index (BMI)-matched controls. PA status was defined according to number of steps (≥7500 steps, active, or <7500 steps, sedentary). BMI was lower in active women from both groups. Active PCOS women presented lower waist circumference (WC) and lipid accumulation product (LAP) values versus sedentary PCOS women. In the control group, active women also had lower WC, lower values for fasting and 120-min insulin, and lower LAP than sedentary controls. In the PCOS group, androgen levels were lower in active versus sedentary women (p = 0.001). In the control group, free androgen index (FAI) was also lower in active versus sedentary women (p = 0.018). Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and 2000 daily step increments were independent predictors of FAI. Each 2000 daily step increment was associated with a decrease of 1.07 in FAI. Habitual PA was associated with a better anthropometric and androgenic profile in PCOS.

27772674|t|Geolocalization of Influenza Outbreak Within an Acute Care Population: A Layered-Surveillance Approach
27772674|a|We seek to use a novel layered-surveillance approach to localize influenza clusters within an acute care population. The first layer of this system is a syndromic surveillance screen to guide rapid polymerase chain reaction testing. The second layer is geolocalization and cluster analysis of these patients. We posit that any identified clusters could represent at-risk populations who could serve as high-yield targets for preventive medical interventions. This was a prospective observational surveillance study. Patients were screened with a previously derived clinical decision guideline that has a 90% sensitivity and 30% specificity for influenza. Patients received points for the following signs and symptoms within the past 7 days: cough (2 points), headache (1 point), subjective fever (1 point), and documented fever at triage (temperature >38°C [100.4°F]) (1 point). Patients scoring 3 points or higher were indicated for influenza testing. Patients were tested with Xpert Flu (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA), a rapid polymerase chain reaction test. Positive results were mapped with ArcGIS (ESRI, Redlands, CA) and analyzed with kernel density estimation to create heat maps. There were 1,360 patients tested with Xpert Flu with retrievable addresses within the greater Phoenix metro area. One hundred sixty-seven (12%) of them tested positive for influenza A and 23 (2%) tested positive for influenza B. The influenza A virus exhibited a clear cluster pattern within this patient population. The densest cluster was located in an approximately 1- square-mile region southeast of our hospital. Our layered-surveillance approach was effective in localizing a cluster of influenza A outbreak. This region may house a high-yield target population for public health intervention. Further collaborative efforts will be made between our hospital and the Maricopa County Department of Public Health to perform a series of community vaccination events before the next influenza season. We hope these efforts will ultimately serve to reduce the burden of this disease on our patient population, and that this system will serve as a framework for future investigations locating at-risk populations.

27773678|t|Heart rate variability: Pre-deployment predictor of post-deployment PTSD symptoms
27773678|a|Heart rate variability is a physiological measure associated with autonomic nervous system activity. This study hypothesized that lower pre-deployment HRV would be associated with higher post-deployment post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Three-hundred-forty-three Army National Guard soldiers enrolled in the Warriors Achieving Resilience (WAR) study were analyzed. The primary outcome was PTSD symptom severity using the PTSD Checklist - Military version (PCL) measured at baseline, 3- and 12- month post-deployment. Heart rate variability predictor variables included: high frequency power (HF) and standard deviation of the normal cardiac inter-beat interval (SDNN). Generalized linear mixed models revealed that the pre-deployment PCL * ln(HF) interaction term was significant (p<0.0001). Pre-deployment SDNN was not a significant predictor of post-deployment PCL. Covariates included age, pre-deployment PCL, race / ethnicity, marital status, tobacco use, childhood abuse, pre-deployment traumatic brain injury, and previous combat zone deployment. Pre-deployment heart rate variability predicts post-deployment PTSD symptoms in the context of higher pre-deployment PCL scores.

27775720|t|A neuronal PI(3,4,5)P3 -dependent program of oligodendrocyte precursor recruitment and myelination
27775720|a|The molecular trigger of CNS myelination is unknown. By targeting Pten in cerebellar granule cells and activating the AKT1 - mTOR pathway, we increased the caliber of normally unmyelinated axons and the expression of numerous genes encoding regulatory proteins. This led to the expansion of genetically wild-type oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, oligodendrocyte differentiation and de novo myelination of parallel fibers. Thus, a neuronal program dependent on the phosphoinositide PI(3,4,5)P3 is sufficient to trigger all steps of myelination.

27777102|t|Atypical microglial response to biodiesel exhaust in healthy and hypertensive rats
27777102|a|Accumulating evidence suggests a deleterious role for urban air pollution in central nervous system (CNS) diseases and neurodevelopmental disorders. Microglia, the resident innate immune cells and sentinels in the brain, are a common source of neuroinflammation and are implicated in air pollution - induced CNS effects. While renewable energy, such as soy-based biofuel, is of increasing public interest, there is little information on how soy biofuel may affect the brain, especially in people with preexisting disease conditions. To address this, male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats were exposed to 100% Soy-based Biodiesel Exhaust (100SBDE; 0, 50, 150 and 500μg/m(3)) by inhalation, 4h/ day for 4 weeks (5 days / week). Ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule-1 (IBA-1) staining of microglia in the substantia nigra revealed significant changes in morphology with 100SBDE exposure in rats from both genotypes, where SHR were less sensitive. Aconitase activity was inhibited in the frontal cortex and cerebellum of WKY rats exposed to 100SBDE. No consistent changes occurred in pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, nitrated protein, or arginase1 expression in brain regions from either rat strain exposed to 100SBDE. However, while IBA-1 mRNA expression was not modified, CX3CR1 mRNA expression was lower in the striatum of 100SBDE exposed rats regardless of genotype, suggesting a downregulation of the fractalkine receptor on microglia in this brain region. Together, these data indicate that while microglia are detecting and responding to 100SBDE exposure with changes in morphology, there is reduced expression of CX3CR1 regardless of genetic background and the activation response is atypical without traditional inflammatory markers of M1 or M2 activation in the brain.

27777558|t|Pre-Activation Negativity (PrAN) in Brain Potentials to Unfolding Words
27777558|a|We describe an event-related potential (ERP) effect termed the " pre-activation negativity " (PrAN), which is proposed to index the degree of pre-activation of upcoming word - internal morphemes in speech processing. Using lexical competition measures based on word-initial speech fragments (WIFs), as well as statistical analyses of ERP data from three experiments, it is shown that the PrAN is sensitive to lexical competition and that it reflects the degree of predictive certainty: the negativity is larger when there are fewer upcoming lexical competitors.

27777603|t|Angiotensin-converting enzyme insertion/deletion polymorphism association with obesity and some related disorders in Egyptian females: a case-control observational study
27777603|a|According to the WHO report in 2015, obesity is the fifth leading cause of death worldwide, and the prevalence of Egyptian female obesity is 37.5 %. Since obesity is highly influenced by genetics, and adipose tissue renin-angiotensin system is over-activated in obesity, the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism on obesity and related disorders was studied in several populations, because of its effect on ACE activity. Our objective was to study the association of ACE I/D polymorphism with obesity and certain related disorders, namely hypertension, insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, in Egyptian females. Eighty female volunteers were recruited, blood pressure and body measurements were recorded and a fasting blood sample was obtained for the quantitation of glucose, lipid profile, insulin, leptin and identification of ACE I/D polymorphs. Subjects were grouped based on hypertension and obesity states. Comparisons of continuous parameters were made with independent sample t-test between two groups. The frequencies of ACE genotypes and alleles, and the association between gene polymorphism and metabolic parameters were assessed using chi-square or Fisher's exact test. Genotype frequencies were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for all groups. Genotype distribution did not differ significantly between controls and cases of all the studied disorders. Although DD carriers had apparently higher parameters of blood pressure, lipid profile and insulin resistance, only diastolic blood pressure was almost significant (p = 0.057). I-carriers were significantly less susceptible to hypertension than DD carriers having normal waist/hip ratio (p = 0.007, OR = 17.29, CI = 1.81-164.96) and normal conicity index (p = 0.024, OR = 7.00, CI = 1.36-35.93). In DD genotype carriers, a significant association was found between insulin resistance and high body mass index (p = 0.004, OR = 8.89, CI = 1.94-40.71), waist circumference (p = 0.003, OR = 9.63, CI = 2.14-43.36) and waist/height ratio (p = 0.034, OR = 6.86, CI = 1.25-37.61), although the variations in percentages between DD and I-carriers were not high enough to conclude an effect of ACE I/D on such an association. In this sample of Egyptian females, ACE I/D polymorphism was not significantly associated with obesity nor with any of its related disorders studied. The I allele seemed protective against hypertension in subjects with normal, not high, waist/hip ratio and conicity index compared to DD genotype carriers.

27781291|t|Expressed microRNA associated with high rate of egg production in chicken ovarian follicles
27781291|a|MicroRNA (miRNA) is a highly conserved class of small noncoding RNA about 19-24 nucleotides in length that function in a specific manner to post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression in organisms. Tissue miRNA expression studies have discovered a myriad of functions for miRNAs in various aspects, but a role for miRNAs in chicken ovarian tissue at 300 days of age has not hitherto been reported. In this study, we performed the first miRNA analysis of ovarian tissues in chickens with low and high rates of egg production using high-throughput sequencing. By comparing low rate of egg production chickens with high rate of egg production chickens, 17 significantly differentially expressed miRNAs were found (P < 0.05), including 11 known and six novel miRNAs. We found that all 11 known miRNAs were involved mainly in pathways of reproduction regulation, such as steroid hormone biosynthesis and dopaminergic synapse. Additionally, expression profiling of six randomly selected differentially regulated miRNAs were validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Some miRNAs, such as gga-miR-34b, gga-miR-34c and gga-miR-216b, were reported to regulate processes such as proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis and metastasis and were expressed differentially in ovaries of chickens with high rates of egg production, suggesting that these miRNAs have an important role in ovary development and reproductive management of chicken. Furthermore, we uncovered that a significantly up-regulated miRNA - gga-miR-200a-3p -is ubiquitous in reproduction - regulation -related pathways. This miRNA may play a special central role in the reproductive management of chicken, and needs to be further studied for confirmation.

27784277|t|Air pollution, neighbourhood and maternal - level factors modify the effect of smoking on birth weight: a multilevel analysis in British Columbia, Canada
27784277|a|Maternal smoking during pregnancy negatively impacts fetal growth, but the effect is not homogenous across the population. We sought to determine how the relationship between cigarette use and fetal growth is modified by the social and physical environment. Birth records with covariates were obtained from the BC Perinatal Database Registry (N = 232,291). Maternal smoking status was self-reported as the number of cigarettes smoked per day usually at the first prenatal care visit. Census dissemination areas (DAs) were used as neighbourhood - level units and linked to individual births using residential postal codes to assign exposure to particulate air pollution (PM2.5) and neighbourhood - level attributes such as socioeconomic status (SES), proportion of post-secondary education, immigrant density and living in a rural place. Random coefficient models were used with cigarettes /day modeled with a random slope to estimate its between- DA variability and test cross-level interactions with the neighbourhood - level variables on continuous birth weight. A significant negative and non-linear association was found between maternal smoking and birth weight. There was significant between- DA intercept variability in birth weight as well as between- DA slope variability of maternal smoking on birth weight of which 68 and 30 % respectively was explained with the inclusion of DA - level variables and their cross-level interactions. High DA - level SES had a strong positive association with birth weight but the effect was moderated with increased cigarettes /day. Conversely, heavy smokers showed the largest increases in birth weight with rising neighbourhood education levels. Increased levels of PM2.5 and immigrant density were negatively associated with birth weight, but showed positive interactions with increased levels of smoking. Older maternal age and suspected drug or alcohol use both had negative interactions with increased levels of maternal smoking. Maternal smoking had a negative and non-linear dose-response association with birth weight which was highly variable between neighbourhood s and evidence of effect modification with neighbourhood - level factors. These results suggest that focusing exclusively on individual behaviours may have limited success in improving outcomes without addressing the contextual influences at the neighbourhood - level. Further studies are needed to corroborate our findings and to understand how neighbourhood - level attributes interact with smoking to affect birth outcomes.

27786590|t|Individual Leg Muscle Contributions to the Cost of Walking: Effects of Age and Walking Speed
27786590|a|This study examined the contributions of individual muscles to changes in energetic cost of transport (COT) over seven walking speeds, and compared results between healthy young and elderly subjects. Twenty six participants (13 young aged 18-30; 13 old aged 70-80) were recruited. COT (O2/kg body mass/km) was calculated by standardizing the mean oxygen consumption recorded during steady state walking. Electromyography signals from 10 leg muscles were used to calculate the cumulative activity required to traverse a unit of distance (CMAPD) for each muscle at each speed. In the old group CMAPD was correlated with COT, presented higher and more variable values, and showed greater increases around optimal speed for all studied muscles. Soleus CMAPD was independent of speed in the young group, but this was not evident with aging. Greater energy cost of walking in older individuals seems to be attributable to increased energy cost of all lower limb muscles.

27790487|t|Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) Correlation with Severity of Coronary Artery Disease in Non-diabetic Patients - A Hospital based Study from North-Eastern India
27790487|a|Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels are predictive of cardiovascular disease and mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus, however, association of HbA1c with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) in non-diabetics is inconsistent. To evaluate the correlation between HbA1c level and severity of CAD in non-diabetic patients using SYNTAX score in a cohort of proven CAD on angiography at Gauhati Medical College, Guwahati, Assam, India, which is a major tertiary care hospital of North-Eastern India. We prospectively collected data of non-diabetic patients with proven CAD on angiography from June 2014 to June 2015. Patients were divided into four groups (interquartiles) according to HbA1c levels, less than 4.8%, 4.8% to 5.1%, 5.1% to 5.6%, and 5.6% to 6.5%. Severity of CAD was assessed using SYNTAX score and the number of coronary vessels diseased. We compared different quartiles of HbA1c with regard to SYNTAX score and number of diseased vessels. A total of 346 patients were included in the study. Mean age was 58.1±10.4 years. Of the total 91.9% (318) were males, 44.8% (155) were hypertensives, 29.2% (101) were smokers and 34.7% (120) were dyslipidemic. We found that CAD severity by SYNTAX score as well as number of vessels involved was significantly different among quartiles (p-values <0.001 and <0.001 respectively). Increase in HbA1c level was strongly correlated with disease severity and higher SYNTAX score. A significant increase was noted in the mean number of diseased vessels (p-value <0.001) as HbA1c level increases. Age, gender, hypertension and dyslipidemia did not show significant difference among quartiles however smoking was found to be an independent predictor of severity of CAD by SYNTAX score (p <0.05). From this clinical study, we can conclude that a significant correlation exists between HbA1c and severity of CAD by SYNTAX score as well as number of vessels involved in non- diabetes.

27792780|t|On the Relation between Face and Object Recognition in Developmental Prosopagnosia: No Dissociation but a Systematic Association
27792780|a|There is an ongoing debate about whether face recognition and object recognition constitute separate domains. Clarification of this issue can have important theoretical implications as face recognition is often used as a prime example of domain - specificity in mind and brain. An important source of input to this debate comes from studies of individuals with developmental prosopagnosia, suggesting that face recognition can be selectively impaired. We put the selectivity hypothesis to test by assessing the performance of 10 individuals with developmental prosopagnosia on demanding tests of visual object processing involving both regular and degraded drawings. None of the individuals exhibited a clear dissociation between face and object recognition, and as a group they were significantly more affected by degradation of objects than control participants. Importantly, we also find positive correlations between the severity of the face recognition impairment and the degree of impaired performance with degraded objects. This suggests that the face and object deficits are systematically related rather than coincidental. We conclude that at present, there is no strong evidence in the literature on developmental prosopagnosia supporting domain - specific accounts of face recognition.

27794081|t|Reduced Chest and Abdominal Wall Mobility and Their Relationship to Lung Function, Respiratory Muscle Strength, and Exercise Tolerance in Subjects With COPD
27794081|a|Advanced air-flow limitation in patients with COPD leads to a reduction in vital capacity, respiratory muscle strength, and exercise capacity. However, its impact on chest and abdominal wall mobility is unknown. This study aimed to ascertain the prevalence of patients with COPD with reduced chest and abdominal wall mobility and to investigate the effect of reduced chest and abdominal wall mobility on pulmonary function, respiratory muscle strength, and exercise capacity. In 51 elderly male subjects with COPD, chest and abdominal wall mobility, FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC, maximal inspiratory pressure (PImax), maximal expiratory pressure (PEmax), and the 6-min walk distance (6MWD) were assessed. Chest and abdominal wall mobility were measured using the breathing movement scale (0-8) at the 3 regions (upper chest, lower chest, and abdomen). Reduced mobility was defined as a value lower than the lower limit of the normal scale. The unpaired t test, Mann-Whitney test, and multiple regression analysis were performed. The percentages of subjects with reduced mobility were 78% for the upper chest, 76% for the lower chest, and 53% for the abdomen. The subjects with reduced mobility had significantly low FVC, FEV1, and 6MWD in each region and significantly low FEV1/FVC, PImax, and PEmax in the abdominal region compared with those with nonreduced mobility. FVC and 6MWD were independently associated with the scale values in each region and with the abdominal scale value, respectively. The majority of subjects with COPD had reduced chest and abdominal wall mobility, which was independently associated with FVC. Even though abdominal wall mobility was relatively preserved compared with chest wall mobility, it was also independently associated with 6MWD.

27794108|t|FGF21 is a biomarker for mitochondrial translation and mtDNA maintenance disorders
27794108|a|To validate new mitochondrial myopathy serum biomarkers for diagnostic use. We analyzed serum FGF21 (S-FGF21) and GDF15 from patients with (1) mitochondrial diseases and (2) nonmitochondrial disorders partially overlapping with mitochondrial disorder phenotypes. We (3) did a meta-analysis of S-FGF21 in mitochondrial disease and (4) analyzed S-Fgf21 and skeletal muscle Fgf21 expression in 6 mouse models with different muscle - manifesting mitochondrial dysfunctions. We report that S-FGF21 consistently increases in primary mitochondrial myopathy, especially in patients with mitochondrial translation defects or mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions (675 and 347 pg/mL, respectively; controls: 66 pg/mL, p < 0.0001 for both). This is corroborated in mice (mtDNA deletions 1,163 vs 379 pg/mL, p < 0.0001). However, patients and mice with structural respiratory chain subunit or assembly factor defects showed low induction (human 335 pg/mL, p < 0.05; mice 335 pg/mL, not significant). Overall specificities of FGF21 and GDF15 to find patients with mitochondrial myopathy were 89.3% vs 86.4%, and sensitivities 67.3% and 76.0%, respectively. However, GDF15 was increased also in a wide range of nonmitochondrial conditions. S-FGF21 is a specific biomarker for muscle - manifesting defects of mitochondrial translation, including mitochondrial transfer-RNA mutations and primary and secondary mtDNA deletions, the most common causes of mitochondrial disease. However, normal S-FGF21 does not exclude structural respiratory chain complex or assembly factor defects, important to acknowledge in diagnostics. This study provides Class III evidence that elevated S-FGF21 accurately distinguishes patients with mitochondrial myopathies from patients with other conditions, and FGF21 and GDF15 mitochondrial myopathy from other myopathies.

27794490|t|The effects of captopril on lipopolysaccharide induced learning and memory impairments and the brain cytokine levels and oxidative damage in rats
27794490|a|Renin-angiotensin system has a role in inflammation and also involves in learning and memory. In the present study, the effects of captopril on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced learning and memory impairments, hippocampal cytokine levels and brain tissues oxidative damage was investigated. The rats were divided and treated: [1] saline (Control), [2] LPS (1mg/kg), [3-5] 10, 50 or 100mg/kg captopril 30min before LPS. The treatment was started since six days before the behavioral experiments and continued during the behavioral tests (LPS injection two h before each behavioral experiment). Administration of LPS prolonged the escape latency and traveled path to find the platform in Morris water maze (MWM) test (P<0.01-P<0.001) while, shortened the latency to enter the dark compartment in passive avoidance (PA) test (P<0.001). Pretreatment by all doses of captopril improved performances of the rats in MWM (P<0.05-P<0.001) and also prolonged the latency to enter the dark in PA test (P<0.001). LPS also increased IL-6, TNF-α, malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) metabolites in the hippocampal tissues (P<0.05-P<0.001) which were prevented by captopril (P<0.05-P<0.001). The thiol, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in the hippocampus of LPS group were lower than the control (P<0.001) while, they were enhanced when the aniamls were pretreated by captopril (P<0.01-P<0.001). The results of present study showed that captopril improved the LPS - induced learning and memory impairments in rats which were accompanied with attenuating hippocampal cytokine levels and improving the brain tissues oxidative damage criteria.

27795701|t|Targeted therapy in gastric cancer
27795701|a|Gastric cancer is the fourth most common cancer worldwide. Surgery in combination with multimodal therapy provides the only curative therapy until now. The importance of targeted therapy became clear over the last few years. Due to the implication of HER2 and angiogenesis -directed targeted therapies major advances in the treatment of gastric cancer could be reached. Nevertheless, benefits in survival remain unsatisfactory and the development of resistance to monoclonal antibodies is arising. A comprehensive and comparative literature research was performed to evaluate the status of HER2 and angiogenesis -directed targeted therapy in gastric cancer. Up to now, trastuzumab and ramucirumab are the only agents showing remarkable benefits in the therapy for the patients suffering from gastric cancer. The limitations of targeted therapies in gastric cancer are mainly associated with the development of secondary resistance. Addition of targeted therapy in second-line treatment is beneficial when compared with chemotherapy alone. Nevertheless, results in first-line treatment remain modest. Therefore, new therapeutic agents and combinations in the first-line treatment of gastric cancer are urgently needed and remain to be validated in clinical trials.

27795726|t|Serum C-Reactive Protein in Children with Liver Disease and Ascites
27795726|a|The diagnosis of peritonitis as a complication of cirrhosis is an important clinical problem. The aim of this study was to evaluate serum C-reactive protein levels as a diagnostic factor for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in child patients with liver disease. In this study, 150 children diagnosed with liver disease and ascites upon admission to Nemazee Teaching Hospital (Shiraz, Iran) were examined. Patients were divided into spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and sterile ascetic fluid groups according to the PMN count ≥ 250/mm(3) in the ascetic fluids. Routine laboratory tests were conducted and quantitative C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were measured for all of the patients. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of CRP was evaluated for diagnosis of SBP. Of 150 cirrhotic patients, 109 patients presented without SBP (52.29% male, mean age: 5.02 ± 4.49 years) and 41 patients presented with SBP (51.21% male, mean age: 4.71 years). Cell counts, protein levels, albumin levels, and lactate dehydrogenize (LDH) levels of the ascetic fluid and serum samples in the SBP group were higher than the rates for those without SBP (P < 0.05(. The mean ± SD of CRP in the SBP group (36.89 ± 23.43) increased significantly compared to the rate among those without SBP (21.59 ± 15.43, P = 0.001). The percentages for sensitivity and specificity of CRP, the diagnosis of SBP based on the PMN count ≥ 250/mm(3), and cultured ascites were 69.23%, 90.25%, 88.43%, and 84.32%, respectively. The areas under the curve of CRP for SBP based on the PMN count ≥ 250/mm(3) and cultured ascites was 0.94 (CI 95%: 0.90 to 0.96) and 0.85 (CI 95%: 0.84 to 0.92), respectively (P < 0.001). Our study showed that CRP is a marker with high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of SBP in cirrhotic children.

27796364|t|Structure of the bacterial plant - ferredoxin receptor FusA
27796364|a|Iron is a limiting nutrient in bacterial infection putting it at the centre of an evolutionary arms race between host and pathogen. Gram-negative bacteria utilize TonB -dependent outer membrane receptors to obtain iron during infection. These receptors acquire iron either in concert with soluble iron-scavenging siderophores or through direct interaction and extraction from host proteins. Characterization of these receptors provides invaluable insight into pathogenesis. However, only a subset of virulence -related TonB -dependent receptors have been currently described. Here we report the discovery of FusA, a new class of TonB -dependent receptor, which is utilized by phytopathogenic Pectobacterium spp. to obtain iron from plant ferredoxin. Through the crystal structure of FusA we show that binding of ferredoxin occurs through specialized extracellular loops that form extensive interactions with ferredoxin. The function of FusA and the presence of homologues in clinically important pathogens suggests that small iron-containing proteins represent an iron source for bacterial pathogens.

27798289|t|Antigen Masking During Fixation and Embedding, Dissected
27798289|a|Antigen masking in routinely processed tissue is a poorly understood process caused by multiple factors. We sought to dissect the effect on antigenicity of each step of processing by using frozen sections as proxies of the whole tissue. An equivalent extent of antigen masking occurs across variable fixation times at room temperature. Most antigens benefit from longer fixation times (>24 hr) for optimal detection after antigen retrieval (AR; for example, Ki-67, bcl-2, ER). The transfer to a graded alcohol series results in an enhanced staining effect, reproduced by treating the sections with detergents, possibly because of a better access of the polymeric immunohistochemical detection system to tissue structures. A second round of masking occurs upon entering the clearing agent, mostly at the paraffin embedding step. This may depend on the non-freezable water removal. AR fully reverses the masking due both to the fixation time and the paraffin embedding. AR itself destroys some epitopes which do not survive routine processing. Processed frozen sections are a tool to investigate fixation and processing requirements for antigens in routine specimens.

27798823|t|Synthesis of 1,2-Dioxetanes as Thermochemiluminescent Labels for Ultrasensitive Bioassays: Rational Prediction of Olefin Photooxygenation Outcome by Using a Chemometric Approach
27798823|a|Great interest in new thermochemiluminescent (TCL) molecules, for example, in bioanalytical assays, has prompted the design and synthesis of a small library of more than 30 olefins to be subjected to photooxygenation, with the aim of obtaining new 1,2-dioxetane-based TCL labels with optimized properties. Fluorine atoms on the acridan system remarkably stabilize 1,2-dioxetanes when they are located in the 3- and/or 6-position (4 h and 4 i). On the other hand, 2,7-difluorinated acridan dioxetane (4 j) showed a significantly enhanced fluorescence quantum yield with respect to the unsubstituted dioxetane (4 a). Some of the synthesized olefins did not undergo singlet oxygen addition and a rationale was sought to ease the photooxygenation step, leading to the TCL dioxetanes. A chemometric approach has been adopted to exploit principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis of the structural and electronic molecular descriptors obtained by DFT optimizations of olefins 3. This approach allows the steric and electronic parameters that govern dioxetane formation to be revealed.

27799048|t|Prostate external beam radiotherapy combined with high-dose-rate brachytherapy: dose - volume parameters from deformably-registered plans correlate with late gastrointestinal complications
27799048|a|Derivation of dose - volume correlated with toxicity for multi-modal treatments can be difficult due to the perceived need for voxel-by-voxel dose accumulation. With data available for a single - institution cohort with long follow-up, an investigation was undertaken into rectal dose - volume effects for gastrointestinal toxicities after deformably-registering each phase of a combined external beam radiotherapy (EBRT)/ high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy prostate treatment. One hundred and eighteen patients received EBRT in 23 fractions of 2 Gy and HDR (TG43 algorithm) in 3 fractions of 6.5 Gy. Results for the Late Effects of Normal Tissues - Subjective, Objective, Management and Analytic toxicity assessments were available with a median follow-up of 72 months. The HDR CT was deformably-registered to the EBRT CT. Doses were corrected for dose fractionation. Rectum dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters were calculated in two ways. (1) Distribution-adding: parameters were calculated after the EBRT dose distribution was 3D-summed with the registered HDR dose distribution. (2) Parameter-adding: the EBRT DVH parameters were added to HDR DVH parameters. Logistic regressions and Mann-Whitney U-tests were used to correlate parameters with late peak toxicity (dichotomised at grade 1 or 2). The 48-80, 40-63 and 49-55 Gy dose regions from distribution-adding were significantly correlated with rectal bleeding, urgency / tenesmus and stool frequency respectively. Additionally, urgency / tenesmus and anorectal pain were associated with the 25-26 Gy and 44-48 Gy dose regions from distribution-adding respectively. Parameter-adding also indicated the low - mid dose region was significantly correlated with stool frequency and proctitis. This study confirms significant dose-histogram effects for gastrointestinal toxicities after including deformable registration to combine phases of EBRT / HDR prostate cancer treatment. The findings from distribution-adding were in most cases consistent with those from parameter-adding. The mid - high dose range and near maximum doses were important for rectal bleeding. The distribution-adding mid - high dose range was also important for stool frequency and urgency / tenesmus. We encourage additional studies in a variety of institutions using a variety of dose accumulation methods with appropriate inter-fraction motion management. NCT NCT00193856. Retrospectively registered 12 September 2005.

27799763|t|Prescription of opioids for breathlessness in end-stage COPD: a national population-based study
27799763|a|Low-dose opioids can relieve breathlessness but may be underused in late-stage COPD due to fear of complications, contributing to poor symptom control. We aimed to study the period prevalence and indications of opioids actually prescribed in people with end-stage COPD. The study was a longitudinal, population-based study of patients starting long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) for COPD between October 1, 2005 and June 30, 2009 in Sweden. A random sample (n=2,000) of their dispensed opioid prescriptions was obtained from the national Prescribed Drugs Register from 91 days before starting LTOT until the first of LTOT withdrawal, death, or study end (December 31, 2009). We analyzed medication type, dispensed quantity, date of dispensing, and indications categorized as pain, breathlessness, other, or unknown. In total, 2,249 COPD patients (59% women) were included. During a median follow-up of 1.1 (interquartile range 0.6-2.0) years, 1,034 patients (46%) were dispensed ≥1 opioid prescription (N=13,722 prescriptions). The most frequently prescribed opioids were tramadol (23%), oxycodone (23%), morphine (16%), and codeine (16%). Average dispensed quantity was 9.3 (interquartile range 3.7-16.7) defined daily doses per prescription. In the random sample, the most commonly stated indication was pain (97%), with only 2% for breathlessness and 1% for other reasons. Despite evidence that supported the use of opioids for the relief of breathlessness predating this study, opioids are rarely prescribed to relieve breathlessness in oxygen-dependent COPD, potentially contributing to less-than-optimal symptom control. This study creates a baseline against which to compare future changes in morphine prescribing in this setting.

27802488|t|In Vivo 3-Dimensional Strain Mapping Confirms Large Optic Nerve Head Deformations Following Horizontal Eye Movements
27802488|a|To measure lamina cribrosa (LC) strains (deformations) following abduction and adduction in healthy subjects and to compare them with those resulting from a relatively high acute intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation. A total of 16 eyes from 8 healthy subjects were included. Among the 16 eyes, 11 had peripapillary atrophy (PPA). For each subject, both optic nerve heads (ONHs) were imaged using optical coherence tomography (OCT) at baseline (twice), in different gaze positions (adduction and abduction of 20°) and following an acute IOP elevation of approximately 20 mm Hg from baseline (via ophthalmodynamometry). Strains of LC for all loading scenarios were mapped using a three-dimensional tracking algorithm. In all 16 eyes, LC strains induced by adduction and abduction were 5.83% ± 3.78% and 3.93% ± 2.57%, respectively, and both significantly higher than the control strains measured from the repeated baseline acquisitions (P < 0.01). Strains of LC in adduction were on average higher than those in abduction, but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.07). Strains of LC induced by IOP elevations (on average 21.13 ± 7.61 mm Hg) were 6.41% ± 3.21% and significantly higher than the control strains (P < 0.0005). Gaze - induced LC strains in the PPA group were on average larger than those in the non-PPA group; however, the relationship was not statistically significant. Our results confirm that horizontal eye movements generate significant ONH strains, which is consistent with our previous estimations using finite element analysis. Further studies are needed to explore a possible link between ONH strains induced by eye movements and axonal loss in optic neuropathies.

27804215|t|Simultaneously Targeting Myofibroblast Contractility and Extracellular Matrix Cross-Linking as a Therapeutic Concept in Airway Fibrosis
27804215|a|Fibrosis after solid organ transplantation is considered an irreversible process and remains the major cause of graft dysfunction and death with limited therapies. This remodeling is characterized by aberrant accumulation of contractile myofibroblasts that deposit excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) and increase tissue stiffness. Studies demonstrate, however, that a stiff ECM itself promotes fibroblast -to- myofibroblast differentiation, stimulating further ECM production. This creates a positive feedback loop that perpetuates fibrosis. We hypothesized that simultaneously targeting myofibroblast contractility with relaxin and ECM stiffness with lysyl oxidase inhibitors could break the feedback loop, reversing established fibrosis. To test this, we used the orthotopic tracheal transplantation (OTT) mouse model, which develops robust fibrotic airway remodeling. Mice with established fibrosis were treated with saline, mono-, or combination therapies. Although monotherapies had no effect, combining these agents decreased collagen deposition and promoted re-epithelialization of remodeled airways. Relaxin inhibited myofibroblast differentiation and contraction in a matrix - stiffness - dependent manner through prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Furthermore, the effect of combination therapy was lost in PGE2 receptor knockout and PGE2 - inhibited OTT mice. This study revealed the important synergistic roles of cellular contractility and tissue stiffness in the maintenance of fibrotic tissue and suggests a new therapeutic principle for fibrosis.

27804311|t|Systemic matrix metalloproteinase-8 response in chronic tonsillitis
27804311|a|The development of several life-long diseases, such as coronary heart disease, is affected by low-grade systemic inflammation. Data on the potential long-term health effects of chronic tonsillitis are limited. Many inflammatory conditions present with enhanced systemic matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-8 response. In head and neck cancer, high plasma level of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 predicts poor prognosis. We analyzed S-MMP-8 with immunofluorometric assay and S-TIMP-1 with an immunosorbent assay in 175 consecutive patients undergoing tonsillectomy for benign tonsillar disease, and in 33 control patients with tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma. Tonsillar human papillomavirus (HPV) status was determined by PCR. In patients with benign tonsillar disease, chronic tonsillitis without hypertrophy was associated with enhanced systemic MMP-8 response. Compared to patients with benign tonsillar disease, patients with tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma had significantly higher concentrations of S-MMP-8 and S-TIMP-1. Neither S-MMP-8 nor S-TIMP-1 correlated with tonsillar HPV positivity.

Ratings on their levels of physical distress, daily functioning, affect, spirituality, and psychologica l empowerment at work were compared before and immediately after the intervention. Participants reported significantly lower levels of negative affect and physical distress, and were less spiritually disoriented after the intervention. Enhanced levels of daily functioning, positive affect, spiritual resilience, and tranquility were also reported. Results also suggested that participants were empowered at work, and specifically felt more able to make an impact on work outcomes. The 3-day BMS intervention program produced a positive and measurable effec t on participants ' holistic well-being and empowerment at work. Educators in related fields could incorporate holistic practices into the curriculum to better prepare the future practitioners, leading to better outcomes both to the professionals themselves and their clients or patients.

27805887|t|Successful Restoration of Severely Mutilated Primary Incisors Using a Novel Method to Retain Zirconia Crowns - Two Year Results
27805887|a|This manuscript describes a simple reliable technique for restoring severely mutilated primary anterior teeth. A rigid glass ionomer post is created over which zirconia crowns can be fitted to achieve a long-term stable esthetic restoration for primary anterior teeth. Children aged 2-5 years with two up to six extensively decayed upper primary incisors were included. Fuji IX was condensed into an intracanal space created to a depth of 3mm, to provide a core which also extended 3mm supragingivally. Crown preparations were completed upon these cores. Zirconia crowns (Nusmile, Houston Texas USA) were fitted and cemented over the prepared cores. All patients were recalled at regular intervals. Twenty-three healthy children with 86 restorations participated in the study. The overall survival of the restorations was 95.3% after 12 months and 80.2% after 24 months. According to Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, the median survival time was not reached while the estimated mean survival time was 22.9 months. This newly described clinical technique is simple and reliable to use for restoration of extensively decayed primary incisors. Use of zirconia crowns retained using this technique offers superior esthetic, durable restorations with remarkable gingival response up to 24 months.

27806385|t|Reimbursement Based on Value in Knee Surgery: What You Need to Know about the Medicare Access and Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015
27806385|a|Health care cost is consuming a large portion of the nation's gross domestic product while placing added economic burdens on physicians and their patients. With total joint replacement being one of the early-targeted procedures in the evolving health care environment, knee surgeons will benefit from developing a critical knowledge on health care reforms and their financial implications. The Medicare Access and Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act represents a cohesive movement toward value-based payment reform and contains several unchartered rulings that require detailed attention by knee surgeons. In this article, we provide a contextual framework of health care legislation that has led to the formation of the current health policy, and present a comprehensive summary and update on the Merit-Based Incentive Payment Systems and Alternative Payment Models reimbursement models.

27806641|t|Empty Capsids and Macrophage Inhibition / Depletion Increase rAAV Transgene Expression in Joints of Both Healthy and Arthritic Mice
27806641|a|Gene therapy has potential to treat rheumatic diseases; however, the presence of macrophages in the joint might hamper adeno-associated viral vector -mediated gene delivery. Here we demonstrate that in arthritic, but also in healthy, mice administration of agents that influence macrophage activity / number and/or addition of empty decoy capsids substantially improve the efficacy of recombinant adeno-associated viral vector 5 transgene expression in the joint. Pretreatment with triamcinolone or clodronate liposomes improved luciferase expression over a period of 4 weeks. Similar results were seen when empty decoy capsids were added to full genome containing capsids in a 5:1 ratio. In a study to assess the duration of expression as well as to investigate the combination of these two approaches, we observed a synergistic enhancement of gene expression, sustained for at least 12 weeks. The enhancement of gene expression was independent of the route of administration of triamcinolone (intra-articular or intramuscular). In healthy mice it was demonstrated that the combination improved expression of the transgene significantly, in a serotype independent manner. These data have implications for future applications of gene therapy to the joint and for other tissues with an abundance of macrophages.

27807162|t|An Inhibitory Septum to Lateral Hypothalamus Circuit That Suppresses Feeding
27807162|a|Feeding behavior is orchestrated by neural circuits primarily residing in the hypothalamus and hindbrain. However, the relative influence of cognitive and emotional brain circuits to the feeding circuitry in the hypothalamus and hindbrain remains unclear. Here, using the cell-type selectivity of genetic methods, circuit mapping, and behavior assays, we sought to decipher neural circuits emanating from the septal nucleus to the lateral hypothalamus (LH) that contribute to neural regulation of food intake in mice. We found that chemogenetic and optogenetic activation of septal vesicular GABA transporter (vGAT)- containing neurons or their projections in the LH reduced food intake in mice. Consistently, chemogenetic inhibition of septal vGAT neurons increased food intake. Furthermore, we investigated a previously unknown neural circuit originating from septal vGAT neurons to a subset of vGAT neurons in the LH, an area involved in homeostatic and hedonic control of energy states. Collectively, our data reveal an inhibitory septohypothalamic feeding circuit that might serve as a therapeutic target for the treatment of eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa. Our results demonstrate that top-down projections from the septum to the hypothalamus control food intake negatively. Given the known role for both of these brain regions in the control of feeding and emotion - related behaviors, these findings reveal previously unknown neural circuitry that is likely implicated in emotional aspects of food intake and provide new insights into the development of therapeutic targets for the treatment of eating disorders.

27807796|t|Human Umbilical Cord Blood - Derived Neural Stem Cell Line as a Screening Model for Toxicity
27807796|a|The aim was to investigate whether a human neural stem cell (NSC) line derived from human umbilical cord blood (hUCB) can be used for toxicity study. Toxicity of both neurotoxic environmental xenobiotics, methyl mercury chloride (CH3HgCl), lead acetate (CH3COOPb), and chlorpyrifos (CP), and non-neurotoxic insecticide, dichlorvos, as well as non-neurotoxic drugs, theophylline and acetaminophen were assessed. Additionally, differentiation of neuronal and glial cell lines derived from hUCB was elucidated. It was observed that CH3HgCl was more toxic to human NSCs in comparison to CH3COOPb and CP. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value against NSCs was 3, 10, and 300 mg/L, in each staining process, acridine orange / ethidium bromide (AO / EB) staining, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, and Hoechst staining, for CH3HgCl, CP, and CH3COOPb, respectively. CH3HgCl had the LC25 value as 10.0, 14.4, and 12.7 mg/L, by staining method mentioned in succession. CP had the LC25 value as 21.9, 23.7, and 18.4 mg/L; similarly, CH3COOPb had LC25 values, successively as 616.9, 719.2, and 890.3 mg/L. LC50 values ranged from 18.2 to 21.7 mg/L for CH3HgCl, 56.4 to 60.2 mg/L for CP, and 1000 to 1460.1 for CH3COOPb. Theophylline, acetaminophen, and dichlorvos had no impact on the viability of NSCs. This work justified that hUCB - NSC model can be used for toxicity study.

27809747|t|MiR 221 / 222 as new players in tamoxifen resistance
27809747|a|Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in women. Despite advances in early detection and treatment, it has the second highest mortality rate after lung cancer. Around 85% of breast carcinomas are ER+; thus, antiestrogens like tamoxifen are beneficial. Although, tamoxifen is useful for many patients, plenty of patients respond poorly to initial therapy or recurrence occurs in about 30% of cases, because tamoxifen resistance happens. Drug resistance remains a major clinical obstacle to successful treatment of breast cancer and more than 90% of unsuccessful treatments are because of acquired resistance and MultiDrug Resistance (MDR) is a major contributor. MicroRNAs are members of a novel class of short noncoding RNAs. Besides to their various roles in gene expression, miRNAs are considered as important cancer therapeutic targets and biomarkers. Since 2005, when miRNA deregulation was first reported in breast cancer, more than 1000 reports have been published about miRNAs. Increasing number of studies showed the importance of miRNAs in antiestrogen therapy, especially on tamoxifen; thus, it is not surprising that these tiny molecules are involved in drug resistance. Due to the pivotal role of these known RNA molecules, in this review, we tried to illustrate the importance of the miRNAs as a new player in breast cancer pathogenesis. We have also focused on cancer drug resistance mechanisms highlighting the role of important oncomirs, miR 221 / 222, involved in cell cycle deregulation in breast cancer. The relationship between these oncomiRs with resistance to tamoxifen is also emphasized.

27812000|t|Ultra-low activities of a common radioisotope for permission -free tracking of a drosophilid fly in its natural habitat
27812000|a|Knowledge of a species ' ecology, including its movement in time and space, is key for many questions in biology and conservation. While numerous tools for tracking larger animals are available, millimetre-sized insects are averse to standard tracking and labelling procedures. Here, we evaluated the applicability of ultra-low, permission - exempt activities of the metastable isomer of the radionuclide Technetium-99 for labelling and field detection of the mountain fly Drosophila nigrosparsa. We demonstrate that an activity of less than 10 MBq is sufficient to label dozens of flies and detect single individuals using standard radiation protection monitors. The methodology presented here is applicable to many small-sized, low-mobility animals as well as independent from light and weather conditions and visual contact with the target organism.

27813390|t|Injury surveillance of female adult Zumba ® dancers
27813390|a|We sought to describe the patterns of injury and to establish the injury incidence rates associated with Zumba ®. Zumba ® dancers were invited to complete an anonymous web-based survey containing 13 demographic background and 14 (1 yr retrospective) injury history questions. Inclusion criteria stated that the respondents had to be aged 18 - 64 yr and currently involved in group -based classes of Zumba ®, either as a registered instructor or class participant. Binomial logistic regression analysis was used to predict the odds of injury during Zumba ® and Mann-Whitney tests were employed to ascertain differences between groups. The survey response rate was 74%. The final sample of respondents (N = 138; female = 100%) included 19 registered instructors and 119 class participants, of which 58% and 16%, respectively, sustained ≥ 1 injury during Zumba ® in the past year. The odds of injury was 7 (95% CI 2 - 19) times greater (p < 0.01) for registered instructors than for class participants. Zumba ® dancers had a 17 (95% CI 7 - 28) % greater (p < 0.01) odds of injury for every 1 h of non- Zumba ®- related moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) engagement per week. The injury incidence rate for registered instructors and class participants was 5.7 (95% CI 3.1 - 8.2) and 3.9 (95% CI 2.5 - 5.3) injuries per 1000 h of exposure, respectively. Zumba ® presents a low risk of injury; for registered instructors, the increased risk of injury is likely due to the high total volume of MVPA participated in weekly.

27818328|t|Clinical Features of Smokers With Radiological Emphysema But Without Airway Limitation
27818328|a|The clinical characteristics of patients with emphysema but without airway limitations remain unknown. The goal of this study was to compare the clinical features of current and former smokers without airflow limitation who have radiologic emphysema on chest CT scans vs a control group of current and ex-smokers without emphysema. Subjects enrolled had anthropometric characteristics recorded, provided a medical history, and underwent low-dose chest CT scanning. The following parameters were also evaluated: pulmonary function tests including diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (Dlco), the modified Medical Research Council dyspnea score, COPD assessment test (CAT), and 6-min walk test (6MWT). A comparison was conducted between those with and without CT - confirmed emphysema. Of the 203 subjects, 154 had emphysema, and 49 did not. Adjusted group comparisons revealed that a higher proportion of patients with emphysema according to low-dose chest CT scanning had an abnormal Dlco value (< 80%) (46% vs 19%; P = .02), a decrease in percentage of oxygen saturation > 4% during the 6MWT (8.5% vs 0; P = .04), and an altered quality of life (CAT score ≥ 10) (32% vs 14%; P = .01). A detailed analysis of the CAT questionnaire items revealed that more patients with emphysema had a score ≥ 1 in the " chest tightness " (P = .05) and " limitation when doing activities at home " (P < .01) items compared with those with no emphysema. They also experienced significantly more exacerbations in the previous year (0.19 vs 0.04; P = .02). A significant proportion of smokers with emphysema according to low-dose chest CT scanning but without airway limitation had alterations in their quality of life, number of exacerbations, Dlco values, and oxygen saturation during the 6MWT test.

27819344|t|Anti-tumor activity of SL4 against breast cancer cells: induction of G2/M arrest through modulation of the MAPK -dependent p21 signaling pathway
27819344|a|SL4, a chalcone -based compound, has been shown to retard tumor invasion and angiogenesis by suppressing HIF1 activity and to induce apoptosis by promoting ROS release. Here, we report that SL4 is able to inhibit the proliferation of different types of breast cancer cell in vitro and in vivo by inducing G2/M cell cycle arrest. Our results showed that SL4 exhibited strong anti-proliferative activity in several human breast cancer cell lines, with IC50 values lower than 1.3 μM. Further studies indicated that SL4 induced G2/M arrest in these cell lines. Mechanistically, SL4 reduces the expression of cyclin A2 and cdc25C and decreases the activity of the cdc2 / cyclin B1 complex. Notably, SL4 treatment resulted in an obvious increase in p21 mRNA and protein levels through activation of MAPK signaling pathways, but not the TGF-β pathway. SP600125 and PD98059, specific inhibitors of JNK kinase and ERK kinase, significantly blocked the SL4 - induced G2/M phase arrest and upregulation of p21. Furthermore, SL4 suppressed the growth of established breast tumors in nude mice through upregulation of p21 and downregulation of cdc25C, and displayed a good safety profile. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the potential value of SL4 as a novel multi-target anti-tumor drug candidate.

27820857|t|Identification of In-Chain-Functionalized Compounds and Methyl-Branched Alkanes in Cuticular Waxes of Triticum aestivum cv. Bethlehem
27820857|a|In this work, cuticular waxes from flag leaf blades and peduncles of Triticum aestivum cv. Bethlehem were investigated in search for novel wax compounds. Seven wax compound classes were detected that had previously not been reported, and their structures were elucidated using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of various derivatives. Six of the classes were identified as series of homologs differing by two methylene units, while the seventh was a homologous series with homologs with single methylene unit differences. In the waxes of flag leaf blades, secondary alcohols (predominantly C27 and C33), primary / secondary diols (predominantly C28) and esters of primary / secondary diols (predominantly C50, combining C28 diol with C22 acid) were found, all sharing similar secondary hydroxyl group positions at and around C-12 or ω-12. 7- and 8-hydroxy-2-alkanol esters (predominantly C35), 7- and 8-oxo-2-alkanol esters (predominantly C35), and 4-alkylbutan-4-olides (predominantly C28) were found both in flag leaf and peduncle wax mixtures. Finally, a series of even - and odd-numbered alkane homologs was identified in both leaf and peduncle waxes, with an internal methyl branch preferentially on C-11 and C-13 of homologs with even total carbon number and on C-12 of odd-numbered homologs. Biosynthetic pathways are suggested for all compounds, based on common structural features and matching chain length profiles with other wheat wax compound classes.

27821359|t|Pupillary response abnormalities in depressive disorders
27821359|a|Depressive disorders lack objective physiological measurements to characterize the affected population and facilitate study of relevant mechanisms. The melanopsin - mediated light signaling pathway may contribute to seasonal variation and can be measured non-invasively by pupillometry. We prospectively studied changes in melanopsin - mediated pupillary constriction in 19 participants with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 10 control across the summer and winter solstices. The melanopsin - mediated response, as measured by the pupil's sustained constriction six s after a high intensity blue light stimulus, was marginally attenuated in those with MDD relative to controls (p =0.071). The participants with MDD unexpectedly showed a significantly reduced transient pupillary response to low intensity red (p =0.011) and blue light (p =0.013), but not high intensity red and blue light. Sustained pupillary constriction in response to high intensity blue light was more pronounced with increasing daylight hours (p =0.037) and was more strongly related to objectively measured versus estimated light exposure. Melanopsin - mediated impairments in pupil response may serve as a biological marker for vulnerability to depression in low light conditions. Assessment of these and other responses to light stimuli, such as response to low intensity light, may be useful for the study of the neurobiology of MDD and related mood disorders.

27821419|t|Long Noncoding RNAs in Cardiovascular Pathology, Diagnosis, and Therapy
27821419|a|Vast parts of mammalian genomes encode for transcripts that are not further translated into proteins. The purpose of the majority of such noncoding ribonucleic acids (RNAs) remained paradoxical for a long time. However, a growing body of evidence demonstrates that long noncoding RNAs are dynamically expressed in different cell types, diseases, or developmental stages to execute a wide variety of regulatory roles at virtually every step of gene expression and translation. Indeed, long noncoding RNAs influence gene expression via epigenetic modulations, through regulating alternative splicing, or by acting as molecular sponges. The abundance of long noncoding RNAs in the cardiovascular system indicates that they may be part of a complex regulatory network governing physiology and pathology of the heart. In this review, we discuss the multifaceted functions of long noncoding RNAs and highlight the current literature with an emphasis on cardiac development and disease. Furthermore, as the enormous spectrum of long noncoding RNAs potentially opens up new avenues for diagnosis and prevention of heart failure, we ultimately evaluate the futuristic prospects of long noncoding RNAs as biomarkers, and therapeutic targets for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders, as well.

27822189|t|Flexible Coordination of Stationary and Mobile Conversations with Gaze: Resource Allocation among Multiple Joint Activities
27822189|a|Gaze is instrumental in coordinating face-to-face social interactions. But little is known about gaze use when social interactions co-occur with other joint activities. We investigated the case of walking while talking. We assessed how gaze gets allocated among various targets in mobile conversations, whether allocation of gaze to other targets affects conversational coordination, and whether reduced availability of gaze for conversational coordination affects conversational performance and content. In an experimental study, pairs were videotaped in four conditions of mobility (standing still, talking while walking along a straight-line itinerary, talking while walking along a complex itinerary, or walking along a complex itinerary with no conversational task). Gaze to partners was substantially reduced in mobile conversations, but gaze was still used to coordinate conversation via displays of mutual orientation, and conversational performance and content was not different between stationary and mobile conditions. Results expand the phenomena of multitasking to joint activities.

27823893|t|Sepsis Clinical Criteria in Emergency Department Patients Admitted to an Intensive Care Unit: An External Validation Study of Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment
27823893|a|Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) is a prognostic score for patients with sepsis. Our aim was to compare the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC), sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios of qSOFA vs. systemic inflammation response syndrome (SIRS) in predicting in-hospital mortality among emergency department (ED) patients with suspected infection admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). We conducted a retrospective cohort chart review study of ED patients admitted to an ICU with suspected infection from August 1, 2012 to February 28, 2015. We included all patients with body fluid cultures sampled either during their ED stay without antibiotic administration or within 24 h of antibiotics administered in the ED. Trained chart abstractors blinded to the study hypothesis double-entered data from each patient's electronic medical record including demographic characteristics, vital signs, laboratory study results, physical examination findings, and in-hospital mortality. We then calculated the AUROC, sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios for qSOFA and SIRS for predicting in-hospital mortality. Of 214 patients admitted to an ICU with presumed sepsis, 39 (18.2%) died during hospitalization. The AUROC value was 0.65 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56-0.74) for SIRS vs. 0.66 (95% CI 0.57-0.76) for qSOFA; 2+ qSOFA criteria predicted in-hospital mortality with 89.7% sensitivity, 27.4% specificity, 1.2 positive likelihood ratio, and 0.4 negative likelihood ratio. Among ED patients admitted to an ICU, the SIRS and qSOFA criteria had comparable prognostic value for predicting in-hospital mortality. These prognostic values are similar to those reported by the Sepsis-3 guidelines for ICU encounters.

27823981|t|Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation improves cognitive function of Alzheimer's disease patients
27823981|a|Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) acts as a kind of widely-applied and non-invasive method in the intervention of some neurological disorders. This prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigates the effect of rTMS on 30 cases of Alzheimer's disease (AD) participants, who were classified into mild and moderate groups. Neuropsychological tests were carried out using the AD Assessment Scale - cognitive subscale (ADAS - cog), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and World Health Organization University of California-Los Angeles, Auditory Verbal Learning Test (WHO-UCLA AVLT) before, immediately after, and 6 weeks after the intervention. In this work, data from 30 AD patients revealed that there was no obvious interaction effect of time-by-group. The ADAS - cog, MMSE and WHO-UCLA AVLT score in the rTMS group was significantly improved compared with baselines at 6 weeks after treatment (all p<0.05). Meanwhile, MoCA scores were also obviously ameliorated in the mild AD patients with rTMS. Besides, subgroup analysis showed that the effect of rTMS on the memory and language of mild AD patients was superior to those of moderate AD patients. In conclusion, our findings suggested that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation improves cognitive function, memory and language level of AD patients, especially in the mild stage of AD. Thus, rTMS can be recommended as a promising adjuvant therapy combined with cholinesterase inhibitors at the mild stage of AD patients.

27824066|t|A Novel Insulin/Glucose Model after a Mixed-Meal Test in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes on Insulin Pump Therapy
27824066|a|Current closed-loop insulin delivery methods stem from sophisticated models of the glucose-insulin (G/I) system, mostly based on complex studies employing glucose tracer technology. We tested the performance of a new minimal model (GLUKINSLOOP 2.0) of the G/I system to characterize the glucose and insulin dynamics during multiple mixed meal tests (MMT) of different sizes in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) on insulin pump therapy (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, CSII). The GLUKINSLOOP 2.0 identified the G/I system, provided a close fit of the G/I time-courses and showed acceptable reproducibility of the G/I system parameters in repeated studies of identical and double-sized MMTs. This model can provide a fairly good and reproducible description of the G/I system in T1D patients on CSII, and it may be applied to create a bank of "virtual" patients. Our results might be relevant at improving the architecture of upcoming closed-loop CSII systems.

27824925|t|Impact of Strategically Located White Matter Hyperintensities on Cognition in Memory Clinic Patients with Small Vessel Disease
27824925|a|Studies on the impact of small vessel disease (SVD) on cognition generally focus on white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume. The extent to which WMH location relates to cognitive performance has received less attention, but is likely to be functionally important. We examined the relation between WMH location and cognition in a memory clinic cohort of patients with sporadic SVD. A total of 167 patients with SVD were recruited from memory clinics. Assumption-free region of interest-based analyses based on major white matter tracts and voxel - wise analyses were used to determine the association between WMH location and executive functioning, visuomotor speed and memory. Region of interest-based analyses showed that WMHs located particularly within the anterior thalamic radiation and forceps minor were inversely associated with both executive functioning and visuomotor speed, independent of total WMH volume. Memory was significantly associated with WMH volume in the forceps minor, independent of total WMH volume. An independent assumption-free voxel-wise analysis identified strategic voxels in these same tracts. Region of interest-based analyses showed that WMH volume within the anterior thalamic radiation explained 6.8% of variance in executive functioning, compared to 3.9% for total WMH volume; WMH volume within the forceps minor explained 4.6% of variance in visuomotor speed and 4.2% of variance in memory, compared to 1.8% and 1.3% respectively for total WMH volume. Our findings identify the anterior thalamic radiation and forceps minor as strategic white matter tracts in which WMHs are most strongly associated with cognitive impairment in memory clinic patients with SVD. WMH volumes in individual tracts explained more variance in cognition than total WMH burden, emphasizing the importance of lesion location when addressing the functional consequences of WMHs.

27825443|t|Natural competence for transformation
27825443|a|While most molecular biologists are familiar with the artificial transformation of bacteria in the context of laboratory cloning experiments, natural competence for transformation refers to a specific physiological state in which prokaryotes are able to take up genetic material from their surroundings. Occasionally, such absorbed DNA is recombined into the organism's own genome, resulting in natural transformation (Figure 1). As a consequence, natural competence for transformation is considered a primary mode of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in prokaryotes, together with conjugation (direct cell to cell transfer of DNA via a specialized conjugal pilus) and phage transduction (DNA transfer mediated by viruses). HGT plays a major role in bacterial evolution, and past research has demonstrated that HGT, including natural competence for transformation, contributes to the emergence of pathogens and the spread of virulence factors. Indeed, Frederick Griffith discovered natural competence for transformation in 1928 while he was investigating the exchange of pathogenic traits in pneumococci. Due to the increase in the abundance and spread of multidrug-resistant microbes, research on HGT is even more important today than ever before.

27826087|t|Three-dimensional constructive interference in steady-state (3D-CISS) sequences and Phase-contrast MRI of arrested hydrocephalus
27826087|a|to evaluate role of three-dimensional constructive interference in steady-state (3D-CISS) sequences and phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PC-MRI) in patients with arrested hydrocephalus. Prospective study was conducted on 20 patients with arrested hydrocephalus. All patients underwent PC-MRI and 3D-CISS for assessment of the aqueduct. Axial (through-plane), sagittal (in-plane) PC-MRI and sagittal 3D-CISS were applied to assess the cerebral aqueduct and the spontaneous third ventriculostomy if present. Aqueductal patency was graded using 3D-CISS and PC-MRI. Quantitative analysis of flow through the aqueduct was done using PC-MRI. The causes of obstruction were aqueductal obstruction in 75% (n=15), 3rd ventricular obstruction in 5% (n=1) and 4th ventricular obstruction in 20 % (n=4). The cause of arrest of hydrocephalus was spontaneous third ventriculostomy in 65% (n=13), endoscopic third ventriculostomy in 10% (n=2), ventriculo-peritoneal shunt in 5% (n=1) and no cause could be detected in 20% of patients (n=4). There is a positive correlation (r= 0.80) and moderate agreement (κ= 0.509) of grading with PC-MRI and 3D-CISS sequences. The mean peak systolic velocity of CSF was 1.86 ± 2.48 cm/sec, the stroke volume was 6.43 ± 13.81μl/cycle, and the mean flow was 0.21 ± 0.32 ml/min. We concluded that 3D-CISS and PC-MRI are non-invasive sequences for diagnosis of the level and cause of arrested hydrocephalus.

27828958|t|Historical Environment Is Reflected in Modern Population Genetics and Biogeography of an Island Endemic Lizard (Xantusia riversiana reticulata)
27828958|a|The restricted distribution and isolation of island endemics often produces unique genetic and phenotypic diversity of conservation interest to management agencies. However, these isolated species, especially those with sensitive life history traits, are at high risk for the adverse effects of genetic drift and habitat degradation by non-native wildlife. Here, we study the population genetic diversity, structure, and stability of a classic " island giant " (Xantusia riversiana, the Island Night Lizard) on San Clemente Island, California following the removal of feral goats. Using DNA microsatellites, we found that this population is reasonably genetically robust despite historical grazing, with similar effective population sizes and genetic diversity metrics across all sampling locations irrespective of habitat type and degree of degradation. However, we also found strong site-specific patterns of genetic variation and low genetic diversity compared to mainland congeners, warranting continued special management as an island endemic. We identify both high and low elevation areas that remain valuable repositories of genetic diversity and provide a case study for other low-dispersal coastal organisms in the face of future climate change.

27829026|t|Cross-Species Rhesus Cytomegalovirus Infection of Cynomolgus Macaques
27829026|a|Cytomegaloviruses (CMV) are highly species-specific due to millennia of co-evolution and adaptation to their host, with no successful experimental cross- species infection in primates reported to date. Accordingly, full genome phylogenetic analysis of multiple new CMV field isolates derived from two closely related nonhuman primate species, Indian-origin rhesus macaques (RM) and Mauritian -origin cynomolgus macaques (MCM), revealed distinct and tight lineage clustering according to the species of origin, with MCM CMV isolates mirroring the limited genetic diversity of their primate host that underwent a population bottleneck 400 years ago. Despite the ability of Rhesus CMV (RhCMV) laboratory strain 68-1 to replicate efficiently in MCM fibroblasts and potently inhibit antigen presentation to MCM T cells in vitro, RhCMV 68-1 failed to productively infect MCM in vivo, even in the absence of host CD8+ T and NK cells. In contrast, RhCMV clone 68-1.2, genetically repaired to express the homologues of the HCMV anti-apoptosis gene UL36 and epithelial cell tropism genes UL128 and UL130 absent in 68-1, efficiently infected MCM as evidenced by the induction of transgene -specific T cells and virus shedding. Recombinant variants of RhCMV 68-1 and 68-1.2 revealed that expression of either UL36 or UL128 together with UL130 enabled productive MCM infection, indicating that multiple layers of cross- species restriction operate even between closely related hosts. Cumulatively, these results implicate cell tropism and evasion of apoptosis as critical determinants of CMV transmission across primate species barriers, and extend the macaque model of human CMV infection and immunology to MCM, a nonhuman primate species with uniquely simplified host immunogenetics.

27829875|t|Mildly raised tricuspid regurgitant velocity 2.5-3.0 m/s in pregnant women with sickle cell disease is not associated with poor obstetric outcome - An observational cross-sectional study
27829875|a|Pulmonary hypertension is associated with 36% mortality in pregnancy, and 6-10% of patients with sickle cell disease have pulmonary hypertension. Tricuspid regurgitant velocity ≥2.5 m/s on echocardiography is a well validated means of screening for pulmonary hypertension in the non-pregnant population. This is a pilot study to determine if this is a useful non-invasive screening test for pulmonary hypertension in pregnancy, and whether raised tricuspid regurgitant velocity ≥2.5 m/s was associated with poor outcomes. This is a cross-sectional study over a five-year period in a tertiary referral centre with a specialised multidisciplinary clinic for pregnant women with sickle cell disease. Women with sickle cell disease, no prior pulmonary hypertension and singleton pregnancies who had echocardiography with a measurable tricuspid regurgitant velocity in pregnancy were included. There were 34 pregnancies, of which eight had tricuspid regurgitant velocity ≥2.5 m/s. There were no significant differences in their characteristics, sickle cell -related complications or medical co-morbidities. The women with tricuspid regurgitant velocity ≥2.5 m/s had similar obstetric and perinatal outcomes as those with a tricuspid regurgitant velocity <2.5 m/s.

27831503|t|A randomized trial of TLR-2 agonist CADI-05 targeting desmocollin-3 for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer
27831503|a|Randomized controlled trial to evaluate synergy between taxane plus platinum chemotherapy and CADI-05, a Toll like receptor-2 agonist targeting desmocollin-3 as a first-line therapy in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with advanced NSCLC (stage IIIB or IV) were randomized to cisplatin-paclitaxel (chemotherapy group, N = 112) or cisplatin-paclitaxel plus CADI-05 (chemoimmunotherapy group, N = 109). CADI-05 was administered a week before chemotherapy and on days 8 and 15 of each cycle and every month subsequently for 12 months or disease progression. Overall survival was compared using a log-rank test. Computed tomography was carried out at baseline, end of two cycles and four cycles. Response rate was evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria by an independent radiologist. As per intention-to-treat analysis, no survival benefit was observed between two groups [208 versus 196 days; hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63-1.19; P = 0.3804]. In a subgroup analysis, improvement in median survival by 127 days was observed in squamous NSCC with chemoimmunotherapy (hazard ratio, 0.55; 95% CI 0.32-0.95; P = 0.046). In patients receiving planned four cycles of chemotherapy, there was improved median overall survival by 66 days (299 versus 233 days; hazard ratio, 0.64; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.98; P = 0.04) in the chemoimmunotherapy group compared with the chemotherapy group. This was associated with the improved survival by 17.48% at the end of 1 year, in the chemoimmunotherapy group. Systemic adverse events were identical in both the group s. There was no survival benefit with the addition of CADI-05 to the combination of cisplatin-paclitaxel in patients with advanced NSCLC; however, the squamous cell subset did demonstrate a survival advantage.

27831992|t|Sex Life and Impact of Operative Intervention on Sex Life-related Pain in Degenerative Spinal Conditions: An Analysis of the SPORT Study
27831992|a|This study is a therapeutic retrospective cohort study OBJECTIVES.: This study aims to determine whether sexual function is relevant for patients with spinal stenosis (SPS) and degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS) and to determine the impact of operative inter vqAvention on sexual function for these patients. The benefits of nonoperative versus operative treatment for patients with SPS and DS with regards to sexual function are unknown. Demographic, treatment, and follow-up data, including the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), were obtained on patients enrolled in the SPORT study. Based on the response to question #9 in the ODI, patients were classified into a sexual life relevant (SLR) or sexual life not relevant (NR) group. Univariate and multivariate analysis of patient characteristics comparing the NR and SLR group were performed. Operative treatment groups were compared to the nonoperative group with regards to response to ODI question #9 to determine the impact of surgery on sexual function. A total of 1235 patients were included to determine relevance of sex life. Three hundred sixty-six patients (29%) were included in the NR group. Eight hundred sixty-nine patients (71%) were included in the SLR group. Patients that were older, female, unmarried, had three or more stenotic levels, and had central stenosis were more likely to be in the NR group. Eight hundred twenty-five patients were included in the analysis comparing operative versus nonoperative treatment. At all follow-up time points, the operative groups had a lower percentage of patients reporting pain with their sex life compared to the nonoperative group (P < 0.05 at all time points except between more than one level fusion and nonoperative at 4 years ' follow-up). Sex life is a relevant consideration for the majority of patients with DS and SPS; operative treatment leads to improved sex life-related pain. 3.

27835851|t|Functional analyses of OcRhS1 and OcUER1 involved in UDP-L-rhamnose biosynthesis in Ornithogalum caudatum
27835851|a|UDP-L-rhamnose (UDP-Rha) is an important sugar donor for the synthesis of rhamnose -containing compounds in plants. However, only a few enzymes and their encoding genes involved in UDP-Rha biosynthesis are available in plants. Here, two genes encoding rhamnose synthase (RhS) and bi-functional UDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-glucose (UDP-4K6DG) 3, 5-epimerase/UDP-4-keto-L-rhamnose (UDP-4KR) 4-keto-reductase (UER) were isolated from Ornithogalum caudatum based on the RNA - Seq data. The OcRhS1 gene has an ORF (open reading frame) of 2019 bp encoding a tri-functional RhS enzyme. In vitro enzymatic assays revealed OcRhS1 can really convert UDP-D-glucose (UDP-Glc) into UDP-Rha via three consecutive reactions. Biochemical evidences indicated that the recombinant OcRhS1 was active in the pH range of 5-11 and over the temperature range of 0-60 °C. The Km value of OcRhS1 for UDP-Glc was determined to be 1.52 × 10(-4) M. OcRhS1 is a multi-domain protein with two sets of cofactor-binding motifs. The cofactors dependent properties of OcRhS1 were thus characterized in this research. Moreover, the N-terminal portion of OcRhS1 (OcRhS1-N) was observed to metabolize UDP-Glc to form intermediate UDP-4K6DG. OcUER1 contains an ORF of 906 bp encoding a polypeptide of 301 aa. OcUER1 shared high similarity with the carboxy-terminal domain of OcRhS1 (OcRhS1-C), suggesting its intrinsic ability of converting UDP-4K6DG into UDP-Rha. It was thus reasonably inferred that UDP-Glc could be bio-transformed into UDP-Rha under the collaborating action of OcRhS1-N and OcUER1. The subsequently biochemical assay verified this notion. Importantly, expression profiles of OcRhS1 and OcUER1 revealed their possible involvement in the biosynthesis of rhamnose -containing polysaccharides in O. caudatum.

27837017|t|Differing rates of antibody acquisition to merozoite antigens in malaria: implications for immunity and surveillance
27837017|a|Antibodies play a key role in acquired human immunity to Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) malaria and target merozoites to reduce or prevent blood -stage replication and the development of disease. Merozoites present a complex array of antigens to the immune system, and currently, there is only a partial understanding of the targets of protective antibodies and how responses to different antigens are acquired and boosted. We hypothesized that there would be differences in the rate of acquisition of antibodies to different antigens and how well they are boosted by infection, which impacts the acquisition of immunity. We examined responses to a range of merozoite antigens in 2 different cohorts of children and adults with different age structures and levels of malaria exposure. Overall, antibodies were associated with age, exposure, and active infection, and the repertoire of responses increased with age and active infection. However, rates of antibody acquisition varied between antigens and different regions within an antigen following exposure to malaria, supporting our hypothesis. Antigen -specific responses could be broadly classified into early response types in which antibodies were acquired early in childhood exposure and late response types that appear to require substantially more exposure for the development of substantial levels. We identified antigen -specific responses that were effectively boosted after recent infection, whereas other responses were not. These findings advance our understanding of the acquisition of human immunity to malaria and are relevant to the development of malaria vaccines targeting merozoite antigens and the selection of antigens for use in malaria surveillance.

27837093|t|Variety of DNA Replication Activity Among Cyanobacteria Correlates with Distinct Respiration Activity in the Dark
27837093|a|Cyanobacteria exhibit light -dependent cell growth since most of their cellular energy is obtained by photosynthesis. In Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, one of the model cyanobacteria, DNA replication depends on photosynthetic electron transport. However, the critical signal for the regulatory mechanism of DNA replication has not been identified. In addition, conservation of this regulatory mechanism has not been investigated among cyanobacteria. To understand this regulatory signal and its dependence on light, we examined the regulation of DNA replication under both light and dark conditions among three model cyanobacteria, S. elongatus PCC 7942, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and Anabaena sp. PCC 7120. Interestingly, DNA replication activity in Synechocystis and Anabaena was retained when cells were transferred to the dark, although it was drastically decreased in S. elongatus. Glycogen metabolism and respiration were higher in Synechocystis and Anabaena than in S. elongatus in the dark. Moreover, DNA replication activity in Synechocystis and Anabaena was reduced to the same level as that in S. elongatus by inhibition of respiratory electron transport after transfer to the dark. These results demonstrate that there is disparity in DNA replication occurring in the dark among cyanobacteria, which is caused by the difference in activity of respiratory electron transport.

27838149|t|Radiosensitization of non-small-cell lung cancer cells and xenografts by the interactive effects of pemetrexed and methoxyamine
27838149|a|The anti-folate pemetrexed is a radiosensitizer. In pre-clinical models, pemetrexed is more effective along with the base-excision-repair inhibitor methoxyamine. We tested whether methoxyamine enhances pemetrexed -mediated radiosensitization of lung adenocarcinoma cells and xenografts. A549 and H1299 cells were evaluated for cell cycle distribution by flow cytometry, radiosensitization by clonogenic assay, and DNA repair by neutral comet assay and repair protein activation. H460 cells were included in some studies. Xenografts in nude mice received drug (s) and/or radiation, and tumor growth was monitored by caliper and in vivo toxicity by animal weight. Exposure to pemetrexed / methoxyamine for 24 (H1299, H460) or 48 (A549)hours before irradiation resulted in accumulation of cells near the radiosensitive G1/S border; dose - enhancement factors of 1.62±0.19, 1.97±0.25, and 1.67±0.30, respectively; reduction of mean inactivation dose by 32%, 30%, and 46%, respectively; and significant reductions of SF2 and SF4 (p<0.05). Radiosensitization was associated with rapid DNA double-strand-break rejoining and increased levels of DNA-PKcs. Both tumor-growth rate and tumor-growth delay were significantly improved by adding methoxyamine to pemetrexed pre-irradiation (p<0.0001); no mice lost weight during treatment. Addition of methoxyamine to pemetrexed and fractionated radiotherapy may improve outcome for patients with locally advanced non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer.

27842269|t|Using language for social interaction: Communication mechanisms promote recovery from chronic non-fluent aphasia
27842269|a|Clinical research highlights the importance of massed practice in the rehabilitation of chronic post-stroke aphasia. However, while necessary, massed practice may not be sufficient for ensuring progress in speech-language therapy. Motivated by recent advances in neuroscience, it has been claimed that using language as a tool for communication and social interaction leads to synergistic effects in left perisylvian eloquent areas. Here, we conducted a crossover randomized controlled trial to determine the influence of communicative language function on the outcome of intensive aphasia therapy. Eighteen individuals with left-hemisphere lesions and chronic non-fluent aphasia each received two types of training in counterbalanced order: (i) Intensive Language-Action Therapy (ILAT, an extended form of Constraint-Induced Aphasia Therapy) embedding verbal utterances in the context of communication and social interaction, and (ii) Naming Therapy focusing on speech production per se. Both types of training were delivered with the same high intensity (3.5 h per session) and duration (six consecutive working days), with therapy materials and number of utterances matched between treatment groups. A standardized aphasia test battery revealed significantly improved language performance with ILAT, independent of when this method was administered. In contrast, Naming Therapy tended to benefit language performance only when given at the onset of the treatment, but not when applied after previous intensive training. The current results challenge the notion that massed practice alone promotes recovery from chronic post-stroke aphasia. Instead, our results demonstrate that using language for communication and social interaction increases the efficacy of intensive aphasia therapy.

27844448|t|miR-27b inhibits gastric cancer metastasis by targeting NR2F2
27844448|a|Increasing attention is focused on the down-regulation of miRNAs in cancer process. Nuclear receptor subfamily 2 (NR2F2, also known as COUP-TFII) is involved in the development of many types of cancers, but its role in gastric cancer remains elusive. In this experiment, oncomine and Kaplan-meier database revealed that NR2F2 was up-regulated in gastric cancer and that the high NR2F2 expression contributed to poor survival. MicroRNA-27b was targeted and down-regulated by NR2F2 in human gastric cancer tissues and cells. The ectopic expression of miR-27b inhibited gastric cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Assays suggested that the overexpression of miR-27b could promote MGC-803 cells ' migration and invasion and retard their metastasis to the liver. In addition, down-regulation of miR-27b enhanced GES-1 cells ' proliferation and metastasis in vitro. These findings reveal that miR-27b is a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer and a biomarker for improving patients ' survival.

27845744|t|Promoting Healthy Growth or Feeding Obesity? The Need for Evidence -Based Oversight of Infant Nutritional Supplement Claims
27845744|a|The Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) model recognizes growth in infancy and childhood as a fundamental determinant of lifespan health. Evidence of long-term health risks among small neonates who subsequently grow rapidly poses a challenge for interventions aiming to support healthy growth, not merely drive weight gain. Defining healthy growth beyond "getting bigger" is essential as infant and young child feeding industries expand. Liquid -based nutritional supplements, originally formulated for undernourished children, are increasingly marketed for and consumed by children generally. Clarifying the nature of the evidentiary base on which structure/function claims promoting " healthy growth " are constructed is important to curb invalid generalizations. Evidence points to changing social beliefs and cultural practices surrounding supplementary feeding, raising specific concerns about the long-term health consequences of an associated altered feeding culture, including reduced dietary variety and weight gain. Reassessing the evidence for and relevance of dietary supplements' " promoting healthy growth " claims for otherwise healthy children is both needed in a time of global obesity and an opportunity to refine intervention approaches among small children for whom rapid subsequent growth in early life augments risk for chronic disease. Scientific and health care partnerships are needed to consider current governmental oversight shortfalls in protecting vulnerable populations from overconsumption. This is important because we may be doing more harm than good.

27845854|t|On-Site Fertility Preservation Services for Adolescents and Young Adults in a Comprehensive Cancer Center
27845854|a|Adolescents and young adults (AYAs) receiving cancer treatments that may impair fertility should receive counseling about risk of infertility and options for fertility preservation (FP) before treatment and/or during survivorship. Our objective was to define the AYA patient population referred to an on-site fertility consultation service within a comprehensive cancer center and determine factors associated with patients proceeding with FP treatment. We conducted a retrospective chart review of AYA women who completed a consultation at the MD Anderson Fertility Preservation and Family Building Service during the first year of service. Records of 154 referred AYA patients were reviewed for age, ethnicity, cancer type gravidity and parity, survivorship status, and decision to pursue FP treatment. Patients (mean age 29.7) were Caucasian (55%), Hispanic (23%), and African American (10%). The majority of women (67%) were seen for FP before cancer treatment and the remaining sought options for family building while in survivorship. The most common cancer types were hematologic (29%), breast (25%), and gynecologic (23%). Patients referred to an on-site fertility consultation service were medically and ethnically diverse. Interest in fertility counseling and treatment was apparent in both survivorship pre- and postcancer treatment. Although the referral group was ethnically diverse, Caucasian women were most likely to pursue FP treatment compared to women of other ethnicities.

27847549|t|Results of a Multicenter, Randomized, Controlled Trial of a Hydrogen Peroxide -based Kit versus a Benzoyl Peroxide -based Kit in Mild-to-moderate Acne
27847549|a|Objective:To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a novel hydrogen peroxide -based regimen versus a benzoyl peroxide -based regimen in mild-to-moderate acne. Methods: In this eight- week multicenter study, patients were randomized to either a hydrogen peroxide -based or a benzoyl peroxide -based regimen .The primary outcome measure of clinical response was assessed using the Global Acne Grading System (GAGS) at baseline ,four weeks, and eight weeks. At Week 8, a patient self-satisfaction questionnaire was administered. Investigators were also queried at that time regarding assessment of tolerability and cosmetic acceptability. Tolerability was also measured at each visit. Results: Both treatment regimens were associated with improvement of GAGS score at Week 8 compared to baseline (p<0.0001). GAGS score did not differ significantly between the two regimens over the same period (p=0.7765). No significant adverse events were reported or observed in either treatment arm. Both patients and investigators found both regimens to be similarly effective and cosmetically acceptable. Conclusion: A novel hydrogen peroxide -based regimen was shown to be comparable in efficacy, safety, and cosmetic acceptability to a benzoyl peroxide -based regimen in the treatment of mild-to-moderate acne.

27847822|t|Multisensory Integration in the Virtual Hand Illusion with Active Movement
27847822|a|Improving the sense of immersion is one of the core issues in virtual reality. Perceptual illusions of ownership can be perceived over a virtual body in a multisensory virtual reality environment. Rubber Hand and Virtual Hand Illusions showed that body ownership can be manipulated by applying suitable visual and tactile stimulation. In this study, we investigate the effects of multisensory integration in the Virtual Hand Illusion with active movement. A virtual xylophone playing system which can interactively provide synchronous visual, tactile, and auditory stimulation was constructed. We conducted two experiments regarding different movement conditions and different sensory stimulations. Our results demonstrate that multisensory integration with free active movement can improve the sense of immersion in virtual reality.

27847836|t|Obstructive Acute Pancreatitis Secondary to PEG Tube Migration
27847836|a|Percutaneous gastrostomy is a well-established method of providing enteral nutrition to patients incapable of oral intake, or for whom oral intake is insufficient to meet metabolic needs. In comparison to total parenteral nutrition, enteral feeding is advantageous in that it helps maintain gut mucosal integrity, which decreases the risk of bacterial translocation through the gastrointestinal tract. Complications include bleeding, aspiration, internal organ injury, perforation, periostomal leaks, tube dislodgement, and occlusion. Acute pancreatitis secondary to percutaneous gastrostomy tube migration is rare. We present a patient with acute obstructive pancreatitis secondary to percutaneous gastrostomy tube migration.

27848238|t|A Tractable Method for Measuring Nanomaterial Risk Using Bayesian Networks
27848238|a|While control banding has been identified as a suitable framework for the evaluation and the determination of potential human health risks associated with exposure to nanomaterials (NMs), the approach currently lacks any implementation that enjoys widespread support. Large inconsistencies in characterisation data, toxicological measurements and exposure scenarios make it difficult to map and compare the risk associated with NMs based on physicochemical data, concentration and exposure route. Here we demonstrate the use of Bayesian networks as a reliable tool for NM risk estimation. This tool is tractable, accessible and scalable. Most importantly, it captures a broad span of data types, from complete, high quality data sets through to data sets with missing data and/or values with a relatively high spread of probability distribution. The tool is able to learn iteratively in order to further refine forecasts as the quality of data available improves. We demonstrate how this risk measurement approach works on NMs with varying degrees of risk potential, namely, carbon nanotubes, silver and titanium dioxide. The results afford even non-experts an accurate picture of the occupational risk probabilities associated with these NMs and, in doing so, demonstrated how NM risk can be evaluated into a tractable, quantitative risk comparator.

27849409|t|Gender and Direction of Effect of Alcohol Problems and Internalizing Symptoms in a Longitudinal Sample of College Students
27849409|a|Alcohol problems and internalizing symptoms are consistently found to be associated but how they relate to each other is unclear. The present study aimed to address limitations in the literature of comorbidity of alcohol problems and internalizing symptoms by investigating the direction of effect between the phenotypes and possible gender differences in college students. We utilized data from a large longitudinal study of college students from the United States (N = 2607). Three waves of questionnaire-based data were collected over the first two years of college (in 2011-2013). Cross-lagged models were applied to examine the possible direction of effect of internalizing symptoms and alcohol problems. Possible effects of gender were investigated using multigroup modeling. There were significant correlations between alcohol problems and internalizing symptoms. A direction of effect was found between alcohol problems and internalizing symptoms but differed between genders. A unidirectional relationship varying with age was identified for males where alcohol problems initially predicted internalizing symptoms followed by internalizing symptoms predicting alcohol problems. For females, a unidirectional relationship existed wherein alcohol problems predicted internalizing symptoms. Conclusions/Importance: We conclude that the relationship between alcohol problems and internalizing symptoms is complex and differ between genders. In males, both phenotypes are predictive of each other, while in females the relationship is driven by alcohol problems. Importantly, our study examines a population-based sample, revealing that the observed relationships between alcohol problems and internalizing symptoms are not limited to individuals with clinically diagnosed mental health or substance use problems.

27856018|t|Body burden of heavy metals among HIV high risk population in USA
27856018|a|HIV high risk population may face not only the threat of HIV infection but also a higher chance of exposure to environmental contaminants. However, no previous studies have examined the body burden of environmental pollutants including heavy metals among HIV high risk populations. The aim of this study was to investigate whether adults aged 20-59 years old at high risk of HIV infection have higher blood levels of heavy metals compared to those with low risk of HIV infection in United States. We used the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2010 to compare exposures to heavy metals including cadmium, lead, and total mercury by HIV risk status. The results showed that people at high risk of HIV had higher blood concentrations of all heavy metals compared to their counterparts with lower HIV risks. In multivariate linear regression models, HIV risk status was significantly associated with increased blood cadmium, lead, and total mercury after adjusting for age, sex, race, education, and poverty income ratio. Our study suggests that people at high risk of HIV have significantly higher body burden of heavy metals including cadmium, lead, and mercury compared to those with low risk of HIV. Further longitudinal study collecting more pollutants are warranted to determine the potential health effects of these elevated pollutants on both HIV-infected and HIV high-risk populations.

27857155|t|Fluorescence- and magnetic-activated cell sorting strategies to separate spermatozoa involving plural contributors from biological mixtures for human identification
27857155|a|No effective method has been developed to distinguish sperm cells originating from different men in multi-suspect sexual assault cases. Here we combined MACS and FACS to isolate single donor sperm cells from forensic mixture samples including female vaginal epithelial cells and sperm cells from multiple contributors. Sperms from vaginal swab were isolated by MACS using FITC -conjugated A kinase anchor protein 3 (AKAP3) antibody; target individual sperm cells involving two or three donors were separated by FACS using FITC -labeled blood group A/B antigen antibody. This procedure was further tested in two mock multi-suspect sexual assault samples and one practical casework sample. Our results showed that complete single donor STR profiles could be successfully obtained from sperm / epithelial cell and sperm mixtures from two contributors. For unbalanced sperm / epithelial cells and sperm cells mixtures, sensitivity results revealed that target cells could be detected at as low as 1:32 and 1:8 mixed ratios, respectively. Although highly relies on cell number and blood types or secretor status of the individuals, this procedure would still be useful tools for forensic DNA analysis of multi-suspect sexual assault cases by the combined use of FACS and MACS based on sperm -specific AKAP3 antigen and human blood type antigen.

27857815|t|The Role of the Iron Stain in Assessing Intracranial Hemorrhage
27857815|a|The timing of the breakdown of red blood cells and organization of hemorrhage has significance in the catabolism of heme and the processing of iron, but also has a practical application in terms of assigning, or attempting to assign, a time course with respect to traumatic events (e.g. contusions and hemorrhages). Attempts to date contusions, however, have generally been unsuccessful by macroscopic observation, whereas the microscopic observations provide broad data but are also anatomically imprecise as a function of time. Intracranial lesions are of particular significance with respect to the timing of organizing hemorrhage given the acute, and often life-threatening nature of the hemorrhages, and the medicolegal investigation into potential crimes. Of concern is that the Prussian Blue reaction for iron, a relatively straightforward histochemical reaction that has been in use for over 150 years, is sometimes suggested as a diagnostic test for chronicity. Therefore, this study examined the utility of the Prussian Blue iron stain in living patients with intracranial hemorrhages and well-defined symptom onset, to test whether the presence of Prussian Blue reactivity could be correlated with chronicity. It was found that out of 12 cases with intracranial hemorrhage, eight cases showed at least focal iron reactivity. The duration from symptom onset to surgery in those eight cases ranged from < 24 hours to more than 3 days. Of those cases with no iron reactivity, the duration from symptom onset to surgery ranged from < 24 hours to six days. In conclusion, the Prussian Blue reaction was unreliable as an indicator of timing in intracranial hemorrhage. The use of the Prussian blue reaction as an independent indicator of chronicity is therefore not valid and can be misleading. Caution is indicated when employing iron staining for timing purposes, as its only use is to highlight, as opposed to identify, pre-existing lesions. With respect to brain lesions, the Prussian blue reaction should not be used in place of the clinical timing of the neurologic decline, or clinical data that is otherwise more accurate and less susceptible to false positive results.

27860542|t|Successful Fetal Tele-Echo at a Small Regional Hospital
27860542|a|Prenatal diagnosis of complex congenital heart disease (CHD) has been shown to improve newborn outcomes. The rate of prenatal diagnosis and access to fetal echocardiography vary widely across the United States. A clinical fetal tele-echo service was established at King's Daughters Medical Center (KDMC) in Ashland, KY, a region in eastern Kentucky that is 3 h from the nearest congenital heart surgeon. The aim of this study was to determine if fetal tele-echo utilizing local sonographers at a small regional hospital can accurately and efficiently identify fetuses with complex CHD. Medical records were reviewed for all mother-infant pairs who had fetal tele-echoes performed at KDMC and interpreted by University of Louisville pediatric cardiology between March 2011 and December 2013. Findings on fetal tele-echo were compared to newborn echo and clinical course, and divided into four groups: (1) Correct - no difference between fetal tele-echo and newborn echo, (2) Likely Correct-normal fetal tele-echo and benign newborn course, (3) Major Difference -one that affected newborn clinical course, and (4) Minor Difference -did not affect clinical course. Seventy-five mother-infant pairs were analyzed. Fetal tele-echoes were Correct in 21%, Likely Correct in 56%, showed Major Differences in 0%, and showed Minor Differences in 23%. For identifying complex CHD, fetal tele-echo had a sensitivity and specificity of 100%. The average number of fetal echocardiograms per mother-infant pair was 1.1. Fetal tele-echocardiography performed by local sonographers at a small regional hospital can accurately and efficiently identify fetuses with complex CHD.

27861731|t|Identification of mineral - binding peptides that discriminate between chalcopyrite and enargite
27861731|a|Innovative approaches to the separation of minerals and subsequent extraction of metals are imperative owing to the increasing mineralogical complexity of ore deposits that are difficult or even impossible to separate into slurries or solutions containing only the minerals or metals of interest. Low recovery of metal is typical for these complex deposits leading to significant losses to tailings. In addition, the minerals often contain impurities, some toxic, which are difficult and costly to control or manage during the processing of a concentrate or other mineral product. One example of this complex situation is the significant economic and environmental costs associated with diluting and processing copper concentrates containing arsenic (in the form of the mineral enargite, Cu3 AsS4) in the production of pure copper. To overcome these separation problems, we have utilized phage display to identify peptides that demonstrate selective recognition of enargite and the arsenic - free copper sulfide, chalcopyrite. Screening of two random peptide phage display libraries resulted in the identification of an enargite - selective peptide with the sequence MHKPTVHIKGPT and a chalcopyrite - selective peptide with the sequence RKKKCKGNCCYTPQ. Mineral - binding selectivity was demonstrated by binding studies, zeta potential determination and immunochemistry. Peptides that have the ability to discriminate between enargite and chalcopyrite provide a greener option for the separation of arsenic containing contaminants from copper concentrates. This represents the first step towards a major advance in the replacement or reduction of toxic collectors as well as reducing the level of arsenic - bearing minerals in the early stages of mineral processing.

27861771|t|High-density lipoprotein -associated sphingosine-1-phosphate activity in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia
27861771|a|Patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) suffer from high plasma cholesterol and an environment of increased oxidative stress. We examined its potential effects on high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-associated sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) content (HDL - S1P) and HDL -mediated protection against oxidative stress, both with and without statin treatment. In a case-control study, HDL was isolated from 12 FH patients with and without statin treatment and from 12 healthy controls. The HDL - S1P content and the capacity of HDL to protect cardiomyocytes against oxidative stress in vitro were measured. HDL -associated S1P was significantly correlated with cell protection, but not with HDL-cholesterol or apolipoprotein AI. The latter did not correlate with HDL -mediated cell protection. Neither the HDL - S1P content nor HDL protective capacity differed between nontreated FH patients and controls. The relative amounts of apolipoprotein AI and apolipoprotein M were similar between controls and FH patients. Statin treatment had no effect on any of these measures. The FH environment is not detrimental to HDL - S1P content or HDL - S1P -mediated cell protection. Statin treatment does not modulate HDL function in this regard.

27863736|t|Moberg Picking-Up Test in patients with hand osteoarthritis
27863736|a|Clinical measurement. The Moberg Pick-up Test (MPUT) was previously used to evaluate functional performance in patients with hand inflammatory disease. This is the first study using the MPUT in hand osteoarthritis (OA). Compare the functional performance (MPUT) in hand OA patients and healthy controls. Fifty hand OA patients and 50 controls were assessed using the MPUT, AUSCAN and Cochin questionnaires, grip and pinch strength, pain using a visual analog scale and a Likert scale regarding difficulty to perform MPUT. In the MPUT evaluation, the OA group presented a statistically significant difference from the control group. The OA group spent more time executing test. The grip and pinch strength measurements showed higher values for the control group. The OA group reported a greater difficulty than the control group in performing the test. The MPUT is a short and easy to apply test, which can be safely used to assess the functional performance of the hand OA. II.

27867770|t|Soymilk residue (okara) as a natural immobilization carrier for Lactobacillus plantarum cells enhances soymilk fermentation, glucosidic isoflavone bioconversion, and cell survival under simulated gastric and intestinal conditions
27867770|a|Cell immobilization is an alternative to microencapsulation for the maintenance of cells in a liquid medium. However, artificial immobilization carriers are expensive and pose a high safety risk. Okara, a food-grade byproduct from soymilk production, is rich in prebiotics. Lactobacilli could provide health enhancing effects to the host. This study aimed to evaluate the potential of okara as a natural immobilizer for L. plantarum 70810 cells. The study also aimed to evaluate the effects of okara-immobilized L. plantarum 70810 cells (IL) on soymilk fermentation, glucosidic isoflavone bioconversion, and cell resistance to simulated gastric and intestinal stresses. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to show cells adherence to the surface of okara. Lactic acid, acetic acid and isoflavone analyses in unfermented and fermented soymilk were performed by HPLC with UV detection. Viability and growth kinetics of immobilized and free L. plantarum 70810 cells (FL) were followed during soymilk fermentation. Moreover, changes in pH, titrable acidity and viscosity were measured by conventional methods. For in vitro testing of simulated gastrointestinal resistance, fermented soymilk was inoculated with FL or IL and an aliquot incubated into acidic MRS broth which was conveniently prepared to simulate gastric, pancreatic juices and bile salts. Survival to simulated gastric and intestinal stresses was evaluated by plate count of colony forming units on MRS agar. SEM revealed that the lactobacilli cells attached and bound to the surface of okara. Compared with FL, IL exhibited a significantly higher specific growth rate, shorter lag phase of growth, higher productions of lactic and acetic acids, a faster decrease in pH and increase in titrable acidity, and a higher soymilk viscosity. Similarly, IL in soymilk showed higher productions of daizein and genistein compared with the control. Compared with FL, IL showed reinforced resistance to simulatedgastric and intestinal stresses in vitro that included low pH, low pH plus pepsin, pancreatin, and bile salt. Our results indicate that okara is a new potential immobilization carrier to enhance the growth and glucosidic isoflavone bioconversion activities of L. plantarum in soymilk and improve cell survivability following simulated gastric and intestinal conditions.

27871600|t|Comparison of a new visual stylet (Discopo)-guided laryngeal mask airway placement vs conventional blind technique: a prospective randomized study
27871600|a|To compare the ease of laryngeal mask airway (LMA) insertion and fiberoptic view of LMA after placement using the Discopo visual stylet-guided insertion and conventional blind technique. Prospective, randomized controlled study. Operating room in a university hospital. One hundred adult patients scheduled for elective surgery under LMA general anesthesia were enrolled. Patients were randomly allocated to 2 groups: GLMA group using a visual stylet-guided technique (n=50) and BLMA group using standard blind technique (n=50). Correct placement of the LMA was confirmed using clinical test along with fiberoptic assessment. Unblinded data were collected about the insertion time, the first attempt success rate, the LMA position adjustment rate, fiberoptic view of LMA anatomical position, hemodynamic responses, and the adverse insertion responses (bucking, breathholding, and laryngospasm). Blinded data were recorded about postoperative airway morbidity (visible blood staining on LMA at removal, sore throat, and hoarseness). Insertion was more frequently successful at the first attempt in GLMA than that in BLMA group (100% vs 92%; P=.041). The time taken for establishing effective airway was shorter in GLMA than that in BLMA (54.8 vs 62.9 seconds; P=.001). The patients in BLMA group required more readjustment and reinsertion than those in GLMA group (38% vs 0%; P=.000). The fiberoptic view was significantly better in GLMA group (P<.001). No difference between the 2 groups existed regarding hemodynamic stress responses, incidences of adverse insertion responses, and postoperative airway morbidity. By direct visualizing the whole process of LMA insertion, the Discopo visual stylet increases the success rate and accuracy rate of LMA placement without increasing hemodynamic stress response or incidences of adverse events.

27871881|t|Targeting brain and peripheral plasticity of the lipidome in acute kainic acid - induced epileptic seizures in mice via quantitative mass spectrometry
27871881|a|Epilepsy is a highly common chronic neurological disorder, manifested in many different types, affecting ~1% of the worldwide human population. The molecular mechanisms of epileptogenesis have not yet been clarified, and pharmacoresistance exhibited by 30-40% of epilepsy patients remains a major obstacle in medical care. Growing evidence indicates a role of lipid signalling pathways in epileptogenesis, thus lipid signals emerge as potential biomarkers for the onset and evolving course of the epileptic disorder, as well as potential therapeutic agents and targets. For this purpose, we applied a lipidomic strategy to unravel lipid alterations in brain regions, periphery tissues and plasma that are specific for acute epileptic seizures in mice at 1h after seizure induction by systemic kainic acid injection as compared to vehicle controls. Specifically, levels of (i) selected phospholipids and sphingomyelins, (ii) the endocannabinoids anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG), and the endocannabinoid -related compounds oleoylethanolamide (OEA) and palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), (iii) arachidonic acid (AA), (iv) selected eicosanoids, and (v) fatty acyl content of lipidome were determined in pulverized tissues from six brain regions of kainic acid induced epileptic seizure models and vehicle controls: hypothalamus, hippocampus, thalamus, striatum, cerebellum and cerebral cortex, and from peripheral organs, such as heart and lungs, and in plasma. Alterations in lipid levels after acute epileptic seizures as compared to non-seizure controls were found to be brain region - and periphery tissue - specific, including specific plasma lipid correlates, highlighting their value as marker candidates in translational research studies, and/or drug discovery and response monitoring.

27872609|t|Panitumumab -Associated Encephalopathy after Accidental Intra-arterial Application through Dislocated Central Venous Access Device
27872609|a|Acute central nervous system (CNS) toxicity and immune -related side effects are increasingly recognized with the use of monoclonal antibodies for cancer therapy. Here, we report a patient who developed of acute-onset encephalopathy and coma, which began shortly after administration of panitumumab for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. Echocardiography revealed that the drug had been infused into the left cardiac ventricle via a dislocated central venous line. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging disclosed multiple cortical hyperintensities, which were preferentially located in the frontal lobes. While the neurological condition improved within a few days, the patient died 4 weeks later. It seems likely that the administration of the antibody via the intra-arterial route contributed to the development of this condition. Toxic encephalopathy may be a hitherto unrecognized complication of panitumumab treatment and should be taken into consideration in patients developing CNS symptoms undergoing this therapy.

27874309|t|Abundance and Characterization of Perfect Microsatellites on the Cattle Y Chromosome
27874309|a|Microsatellites or simple sequence repeats (SSRs) are found in most organisms and play an important role in genomic organization and function. To characterize the abundance of SSRs (1-6 base-pairs [bp]) on the cattle Y chromsome, the relative frequency and density of perfect or uninterrupted SSRs based on the published Y chromosome sequence were examined. A total of 17,273 perfect SSRs were found, with total length of 324.78 kb, indicating that approximately 0.75% of the cattle Y chromosome sequence (43.30 Mb) comprises perfect SSRs, with an average length of 18.80 bp. The relative frequency and density were 398.92 loci/Mb and 7500.62 bp /Mb, respectively. The proportions of the six classes of perfect SSRs were highly variable on the cattle Y chromosome. Mononucleotide repeats had a total number of 8073 (46.74%) and an average length of 15.45 bp, and were the most abundant SSRs class, while the percentages of di-, tetra-, tri-, penta-, and hexa-nucleotide repeats were 22.86%, 11.98%, 11.58%, 6.65%, and 0.19%, respectively. Different classes of SSRs varied in their repeat number, with the highest being 42 for dinucleotides. Results reveal that repeat categories A, AC, AT, AAC, AGC, GTTT, CTTT, ATTT, and AACTG predominate on the Y chromosome. This study provides insight into the organization of cattle Y chromosome repetitive DNA, as well as information useful for developing more polymorphic cattle Y-chromosome -specific SSRs.

27875058|t|Antenatal Stressful Life Events and Postpartum Depressive Symptoms in the United States: The Role of Women's Socioeconomic Status Indices at the State Level
27875058|a|Approximately 10%-20% of women suffer from postpartum depression (PPD), important predictors of which are antenatal stressful life event (SLE) experiences. The association between women's state-level socioeconomic status (SES) and PPD has not been explored. This study aimed to examine whether the association between antenatal SLE and PPD symptoms was moderated by women's state-level SES. Data from the 2009-2011 Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) were used. State-level women's employment / earnings and social / economic autonomy indices were computed from indicators published by the Institute of Women's Policy Research (IWPR). Multilevel multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed. Among 91,253 women with valid responses, 11.3% had PPD symptoms, prevalence ranging from 7.1% in Illinois to 17.1% in Arkansas. Women who experienced all four stressor categories, including partner related, traumatic, emotional, and financial, had the highest odds (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 5.43; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.36-5.51) of PPD symptoms. The odds of experiencing PPD symptoms decreased with an increase in the state-level social / economic autonomy index (aOR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.64-0.88). There was significant cross-level interaction between number of stressor categories experienced and state-level index. Screening for antenatal SLEs can help identify women at risk for PPD symptoms. That the odds of having PPD symptoms decreased with increasing state-level social / economic autonomy and women residing in states with lower indices were more vulnerable to the impacts of antenatal stressors, could have policy implications related to improving the SES of women in these states.

27876369|t|Multi-component model of intramural hematoma
27876369|a|A novel multi-component model is introduced for studying interaction between blood flow and deforming aortic wall with intramural hematoma (IMH). The aortic wall is simulated by a composite structure submodel representing material properties of the three main wall layers. The IMH is described by a poroelasticity submodel which takes into account both the pressure inside hematoma and its deformation. The submodel of the hematoma is fully coupled with the aortic submodel as well as with the submodel of the pulsatile blood flow. Model simulations are used to investigate the relation between the peak wall stress, hematoma thickness and permeability in patients of different age. The results indicate that an increase in hematoma thickness leads to larger wall stress, which is in agreement with clinical data. Further simulations demonstrate that a hematoma with smaller permeability results in larger wall stress, suggesting that blood coagulation in hematoma might increase its mechanical stability. This is in agreement with previous experimental observations of coagulation having a beneficial effect on the condition of a patient with the IMH.

27877221|t|The Impact of Diabetes on the Risk of Prostate Cancer Development according to Body Mass Index: A 10-year Nationwide Cohort Study
27877221|a|Purpose: We examined the association between obesity and prostate cancer both with and without diabetic patients included in the analysis using nationally representative data of the Korean population from the National Health Insurance System (NHIS). Materials and Methods: Of the 424,712 participants who underwent health examinations in 2002-2008, 139,519 men ≥40 years old and without prostate cancer were followed from the beginning of 2002 to the end of 2012. Multivariate adjusted Cox regression analysis was conducted to examine the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the association between prostate cancer and body mass index (BMI) both with and without diabetes. Results: The HR for prostate cancer according to the existence of diabetes was stratified by BMI in both age - and multivariable-adjusted models. In the population without diabetes, the HR for prostate cancer significantly increased as BMI increased beyond the reference range in a model adjusted for age and multiple variables; however, the increase in the HR was small. In the population with diabetes, the HR for prostate cancer significantly increased as BMI increased from < 18.5 kg/m(2) to within the reference range (18.5 to 22.9) in the multivariable-adjusted model. In addition, a marked decrease in HR in the population with BMI of < 18.5 kg/m(2) was seen compared to the reference or higher BMI population. Conclusion: This population -based study shows the evidence of association between obesity and development of prostate cancer, and the risk increases vary according to the change of BMI category and the existence of diabetes.

27882066|t|Bioinformatic Analysis of Codon Usage and Phylogenetic Relationships in Different Genotypes of the Hepatitis C Virus
27882066|a|The hepatitis C virus (HCV) has six major genotypes. The purpose of this study was to phylogenetically investigate the differences between the genotypes of HCV, and to determine the types of amino acid codon usage in the structure of the virus in order to discover new methods for treatment regimes. The codon usage of the six genotypes of the HCV nucleotide sequence was investigated through the online application available on the website Gene Infinity. Also, phylogenetic analysis and the evolutionary relationship of HCV genotypes were analyzed with MEGA 7 software. The six genotypes of HCV were divided into two groups based on their codon usage properties. In the first group, genotypes 1 and 5 (74.02%), and in the second group, genotypes 2 and 6 (72.43%) were shown to have the most similarity in terms of codon usage. Unlike the results with respect to determining the similarity of codon usage, the phylogenetic analysis showed the closest resemblance and correlation between genotypes 1 and 4. The results also showed that HCV has a GC (guanine - cytosine) abundant genome structure and prefers codons with GC for translation. Genotypes 1 and 4 demonstrated remarkable similarity in terms of genome sequences and proteins, but surprisingly, in terms of the preferred codons for gene expression, they showed the greatest difference. More studies are therefore needed to confirm the results and select the best approach for treatment of these genotypes based on their codon usage properties.

27884163|t|Chronic adiponectin deficiency leads to Alzheimer's disease -like cognitive impairments and pathologies through AMPK inactivation and cerebral insulin resistance in aged mice
27884163|a|Insulin resistance is the major pathogenesis underlying type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and these patients have doubled risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Increasing evidence suggests that insulin resistance plays an important role in AD pathogenesis, possibly due to abnormal GSK3β activation, causing intra- and extracellular amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation. Adiponectin (APN) is an adipokine with insulin-sensitizing and anti-inflammatory effects. Reduced circulatory APN level is associated with insulin resistance and T2DM. The role of APN in AD has not been elucidated. In this study, we aim to examine if adiponectin deficiency would lead to cerebral insulin resistance, cognitive decline and Alzheimer's-like pathology in mice. To study the role of adiponectin in cognitive functions, we employed adiponectin-knockout (APN-KO) mice and demonstrated chronic APN deficiency in their CNS. Behavioral tests were performed to study the cognitions of male APN-KO mice. Brains and tissue lysates were collected to study the pathophysiological and molecular changes in the brain of APN-KO mice. SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line was used to study the molecular mechanism upon APN and insulin treatment. Aged APN -deficient mice displayed spatial memory and learning impairments, fear-conditioned memory deficit as well as anxiety. These mice also developed AD pathologies including increased cerebral Aβ42 level, Aβ deposition, hyperphosphorylated Tau proteins, microgliosis and astrogliosis with increased cerebral IL-1β and TNFα levels that associated with increased neuronal apoptosis and reduced synaptic proteins levels, suggesting APN deficiency may lead to neuronal and synaptic loss in the brain. AD pathologies -associated APN - KO mice displayed attenuated AMPK phosphorylation and impaired insulin signaling including decreased Akt induction and increased GSK3β activation in the hippocampus and frontal cortex. Aged APN -KO mice developed hippocampal insulin resistance with reduced pAkt induction upon intracerebral insulin injection. Consistently, APN treatment in SH-SY5Y cells with insulin resistance and overexpressing Aβ induce higher pAkt levels through AdipoR1 upon insulin treatment whereas the induction was blocked by compound C, indicating APN can enhance neuronal insulin sensitivity through AMPK activation. Our results indicated that chronic APN deficiency inactivated AMPK causing insulin desensitization and elicited AD-like pathogenesis in aged mice which also developed significant cognitive impairments and psychiatric symptoms.

27884960|t|Can inorganic phosphate explain sag during unfused tetanic contractions of skeletal muscle?
27884960|a|We test the hypothesis that cytosolic inorganic phosphate (Pi) can account for the contraction - induced reductions in twitch duration which impair summation and cause force to decline (sag) during unfused tetanic contractions of fast-twitch muscle. A five-state model of crossbridge cycling was used to simulate twitch and unfused tetanic contractions. As Pi concentration ([Pi]) was increased from 0 to 30 mmol·L(-1), twitch duration decreased, with progressive reductions in sensitivity to Pi as [Pi] was increased. When unfused tetani were simulated with rising [Pi], sag was most pronounced when initial [Pi] was low, and when the magnitude of [Pi] increase was large. Fast-twitch extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles (sag-prone, typically low basal [Pi]) and slow-twitch soleus muscles (sag - resistant, typically high basal [Pi]) were isolated from 14 female C57BL/6 mice. Muscles were sequentially incubated in solutions containing either glucose or pyruvate to create typical and low Pi environments, respectively. Twitch duration was greater (P < 0.05) in pyruvate than glucose in both muscles. Stimuli applied at intervals approximately three times the time to peak twitch tension resulted in sag of 35.0 ± 3.7% in glucose and 50.5 ± 1.4% in pyruvate in the EDL (pyruvate > glucose; P < 0.05), and 3.9 ± 0.3% in glucose and 37.8 ± 2.7% in pyruvate in the soleus (pyruvate > glucose; P < 0.05). The influence of Pi on crossbridge cycling provides a tenable mechanism for sag. Moreover, the low basal [Pi] in fast-twitch relative to slow-twitch muscle has promise as an explanation for the fiber-type dependency of sag.

27885308|t|Pancreatic Cancer: A Survival Analysis Study in Oklahoma
27885308|a|Pancreatic cancer is among the most deadly cancers. Risk factors associated with the disease include age, race, sex, smoking status, and diabetes status. We conducted a prospective analysis of risk factors and length of survival among pancreatic cancer patients living in Oklahoma between 1997 and 2012 (n=6,291). Kaplan-Meier survival curves were created followed by the log-rank test to compare difference in the survival time. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to examine the strength of association through the estimated hazard ratios. The median survival time of the cohort was three months. Significant risk factors for reduced survival times included age, stage at diagnosis, and year of diagnosis. Results are in agreement with previous research findings. There have been small but noteworthy improvements in survival times for pancreatic cancer patients in Oklahoma. Length of survival during the study period was significantly associated with known risk factors such as age and stage of diagnosis.

27887661|t|Biochemical and proteomic analyses of the physiological response induced by individual housing in gilts provide new potential stress markers
27887661|a|The objective assessment of animal stress and welfare requires proper laboratory biomarkers. In this work, we have analyzed the changes in serum composition in gilts after switching their housing, from pen to individual stalls, which is generally accepted to cause animal discomfort. Blood and saliva samples were collected a day before and up to four days after changing the housing system. Biochemical analyses showed adaptive changes in lipid and protein metabolism after the housing switch, whereas cortisol and muscular markers showed a large variability between animals. 2D-DIGE and iTRAQ proteomic approaches revealed variations in serum protein composition after changing housing and diet of gilts. Both techniques showed alterations in two main homeostatic mechanisms: the innate immune and redox systems. The acute phase proteins haptoglobin, apolipoprotein A-I and α1-antichymotrypsin 3, and the antioxidant enzyme peroxiredoxin 2 were found differentially expressed by 2D-DIGE. Other proteins related to the innate immune system, including lactotransferrin, protegrin 3 and galectin 1 were also identified by iTRAQ, as well as oxidative stress enzymes such as peroxiredoxin 2 and glutathione peroxidase 3. Proteomics also revealed the decrease of apolipoproteins, and the presence of intracellular proteins in serum, which may indicate physical injury to tissues. Housing of gilts in individual stalls and diet change increase lipid and protein catabolism, oxidative stress, activate the innate immune system and cause a certain degree of tissue damage. We propose that valuable assays for stress assessment in gilts may be based on a score composed by a combination of salivary cortisol, lipid metabolites, innate immunity and oxidative stress markers and intracellular proteins.

27887778|t|Cultivation of four microalgae species in the effluent of anaerobic digester for biodiesel production
27887778|a|This study investigated if an effluent from anaerobic digestion (AD) system can be used as a nutrients source for the microalgae cultivation, and in so doing, if the effluent can be properly treated. Nitrogen and phosphorus in the AD effluent well supported microalgal growth, and their removal efficiency reached >97.9% and 99.2%, respectively. Among four different algal species tested, Micractinium inermum particularly stood out, showing the highest biomass and FAME productivity: 0.16gL(-1)d(-1) with 3.23gL(-1) of dry cell weight, and 0.04gL(-1)d(-1) with 27.54% (w/w) of FAME contents, respectively. As the concentrations of the nutrients decreased over time, the FAME contents were increased and its quality as well, satisfying several biodiesel quality standards. This study supports that the AD effluent can indeed serve as a cheap and nutrient - rich medium for microalgae cultivation, and equally importantly, microalgae can be a workable treatment option for it.

27889529|t|Antiviral activities of selected antimalarials against dengue virus type 2 and Zika virus
27889529|a|In a previous study, twelve antimalarial compounds, amodiaquine (AQ) and derivatives, were shown to have potent anti-dengue viral (DENV) activity by using the stable DENV2 Renilla luciferase reporter replicon expressing BHK-21 cells, infectivity (plaque), and the qRT-PCR assays. In this study, we performed molecular modeling on these compounds to determine their stereo-electronic properties required for optimal antiviral activity. Based on the similarity of calculated stereo-electronic profiles, specifically the electrostatic potential profiles of the compounds, and in silico screening of related compounds from literature, we identified three additional compounds, Quinacrine (QC), Mefloquine (MQ), and GSK369796. Analysis of their antiviral activities indicated that all three compounds have high anti-DENV activity in the DENV2 replicon expressing cells with EC50 values of 5.30 ± 1.31 μM (QC), 3.22 ± 0.37 μM (MQ), and 5.06 ± 0.86 μM (GSK369796). The infectivity assays revealed the EC50 values of 7.09 ± 1.67 μM (QC), 4.36 ± 0.31 μM (MQ) and 3.03 ± 0.35 μM (GSK369796). The mode of action of these compounds is through inhibition of autophagy, thereby affecting DENV2 replication. Moreover, these compounds also showed antiviral activity against the rapidly emerging Zika virus (ZIKV) with EC50 values of 2.27 ± 0.14 μM (QC), 3.95 ± 0.21 μM (MQ), and 2.57 ± 0.09 μM (GSK369796).

27892857|t|Genotyping of German and Austrian Taylorella equigenitalis isolates using repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP) PCR and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)
27892857|a|A total of 124 Taylorella (T.) equigenitalis and five T. asinigenitalis field isolates collected between 2002 and 2014 were available for genotyping using REP- (repetitive extragenic palindromic) PCR and PFGE (pulsed-field gel electrophoresis). The study comprised 79 T. equigenitalis field isolates originating from ten defined breeds of German horses and revealed a spectrum of five REP (rep-E1-E4, rep-E3a) and 15 PFGE (TE-A1-A9, TE-B1-B3, TE-C, TE-E1, and TE-E2) genotypes. T. equigenitalis field isolates (n=40) obtained from Austrian Lipizzaner horses were differentiated into three REP (rep-E1, rep-E3a, and rep-E4) and three PFGE genotypes (TE-A2, TE-A5, and TE-D); those isolated from four Austrian Trotters belonged to the REP / PFGE genotype rep-E2/TE-A1. Interestingly, a T. equigenitalis isolate recovered from a Holsteiner stallion living in South Africa revealed the REP / PFGE genotype rep-E1/TE-A5 which was otherwise exclusively present in the majority of Austrian Lipizzaner horses in our study. The type strain included in this study revealed the genotype REP / PFGE rep-E1/TE-F. Six strains of T. asinigenitalis including the type strain were separated into three REP (rep-A1-A3) and six PFGE genotypes (TA-A1, TA-A2, TA-A3, TA-B, TA-C, TA-D). Overall, the generated REP and PFGE genotypes showed a good correlation, whereas REP-PCR proved to be a suitable method for molecular epidemiological screening of T. equigenitalis and T. asinigenitalis isolates that should be differentiated in detail by genotyping using PFGE.

27896225|t|The Urokinase / Urokinase Receptor System in Mast Cells: Effects of its Functional Interaction with fMLF Receptors
27896225|a|Mast cell and basophils express the high affinity receptor for IgE (FcɛRI) and are primary effector cells of allergic disorders. The urokinase (uPA)-mediated plasminogen activation system is involved in physiological and pathological events based on cell migration and tissue remodelling, such as inflammation, wound healing, angiogenesis and metastasis. uPA is a serine protease that binds uPAR, a high affinity glycosyl-phosphatidyl-inositol (GPI)-anchored receptor. uPAR focuses uPA activity at the cell surface and activates intracellular signaling through lateral interactions with integrins, receptor tyrosine kinases and the G-protein-coupled family of fMLF chemotaxis receptors (FPRs). We investigated the expression of the uPA - uPAR system and its functional interaction with FPRs in human mast cells (MCs). Differently from basophils, MCs produced uPA that was able to induce their chemotaxis. Indeed, MCs also expressed uPAR, both in the intact and in a cleaved form (DII-DIII-uPAR) that can expose, at the N-terminus, the SRSRY sequence, able to interact with FPRs and to mediate cell chemotaxis. MCs also expressed mRNAs for FPRs that were functionally active; indeed, uPA and a soluble peptide (uPAR84-95), containing the SRSRY chemotactic sequence of uPAR and able to interact with FPRs, were able to induce MCs chemotaxis. Thus, uPA is a potent chemoattractant for MCs acting through the exposure of the chemotactic epitope of uPAR, that is an endogenous ligand for FPRs. The same mechanism could be involved in VEGF-A secretion by human MCs, also induced by uPA and uPAR84-95 stimulation.

27898362|t|Psychogenic non-epileptic seizure in patients with intellectual disability with special focus on choice of therapeutic intervention
27898362|a|There have been a number of studies exploring treatments for psychogenic non-epileptic seizure (PNES) but largely neglecting the sizable subgroup of patients with intellectual disability (ID). In the present study, we attempted to demonstrate effects and preferred modes of therapeutic intervention in PNES patients with ID being treated at a Japanese municipal center with a short referral chain. We examined 46 PNES patients with ID (ID group) and 106 PNES patients without ID (non-ID group) retrospectively in case charts. In addition to examining basic demographic and clinical data, effects of different therapeutic intervention were examined as a function of decrease or disappearance of PNES attacks in the ID group. Age at the first visit as well as PNES onset was younger in the ID than in the non-ID group (t=2.651, p=0.009; t=3.528, p=0.001, respectively). PNES -free ratio at the last visit tended to be higher in the non-ID group (chi square =3.455; p=0.063). Psychosis was more often encountered in the ID group (chi square =13.443; p=0.001). Although cognitive therapy and pharmaco-therapeutic approaches were quite similarly distributed in both groups, environmental adjustment was often introduced in the ID group (44%) as compared to the non-ID group (15%) (chi square =14.299; p=0.001). Brief weekly visit service is also more often utilized by the patients with ID (54%) than by those without ID (35%) (chi square =5.021, p=0.025). Optimal treatment approaches in this sizable patient subgroup should be the subject of future prospective studies.

27900080|t|Effect of an immunomodulatory regimen for cancer prevention: A case report
27900080|a|In the present case study, an immunomodulatory regimen for cancer prevention is reported. A patient with an abnormally high level of the tumor markers, carbohydrate antigen-724 (CA724), CA19-9 and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), although without any detectable tumor, was treated with an immunomodulatory therapy featuring an infusion of cytokine-induced autologous killer cells (CIKs) at the request of the patient. Following the therapy, the three tumor markers rapidly decreased to below the normal reference level, although there still were slight fluctuations within a narrow range frequently. The patient was monitored for 21 months to the present day and no abnormality was observed. The results indicated that this therapy may be applied as a novel strategy that is effective and reliable for cancer prevention. As there is no promising regimen for the prevention of malignancies to date, such a treatment may become a major cancer prophylactic regimen, particularly for patients who are at a high risk of cancer.

27900133|t|The relationships between rugby players' tackle training attitudes and behaviour and their match tackle attitudes and behaviour
27900133|a|The tackle event in rugby is a technical and physical contest between opposing players. A player's ability to tolerate and contest during a tackle is a prerequisite for safe participation and success in rugby. Little is known about the relationship between tackle training and tackling in matches in rugby union. Therefore, we investigated the relationships between players' training attitudes and behaviour and their match attitudes and behaviour for tackling in rugby union. A questionnaire was designed to assess attitude (importance) and behaviours (frequency and quantity) among junior (under 19) players on a 5-point Likert Scale. Questionnaires were handed out to 220 players (10 schools) at a tournament and 75% (9 schools, n=164) were returned for analysis. Associations between training attitudes and behaviours were tested using the χ(2) test, Cramer's V and τ-b. The more time spent on emphasising proper technique to prevent injuries in training, the more important players rated 'own safety' (τ-b=0.21, moderate, z=3.1, p<0.01), 'going for the ball only' (τ-b=0.27, moderate, z=4.6, p<0.001) and 'staying on feet' (τ-b=0.23, moderate, z=3.6, p<0.001) in match play. The more time spent on emphasising proper technique to improve performance in training, the more important players rated actions 'going for ball only' (τ-b=0.23, moderate, z=3.7, p<0.001) and ' preventing the ball carrier from retaining position ' (τ-b=0.20, moderate, z=3.1, p<0.01) in match play. This is the first study to report on the relationships between players ' training attitudes and behaviour and their match attitudes and behaviour s for tackling in rugby union. The importance of tackle training to prevent injury, and the amount of time spent on technique to prevent injuries, was associated with behaviours that reduce the risk of injury in matches.

27903991|t|Role of Oxidative Stress and Inflammatory Factors in Diabetic Kidney Disease
27903991|a|Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a serious complication of diabetes mellitus, and its prevalence has been increasing in developed countries. Diabetic nephropathy has become the most common single cause of end-stage renal disease worldwide. Oxidative stress and inflammation factors are hypothesized to play a role in the development of late diabetes complications. Chronic hyperglycemia increases oxidative stress, significantly modifies the structure and function of proteins and lipids, and induces glycoxidation and peroxidation. Therefore, hyperglycemia causes auto-oxidation of glucose, glycation of proteins, and activation of polyol mechanism. Overproduction of intracellular reactive oxygen species contributes to several microvascular and macrovascular complications of DN. On the other hand, reactive oxygen species modulates signaling cascade of immune factors. An increase in reactive oxygen species can increase the production of inflammatory cytokines, and likewise, an increase in inflammatory cytokines can stimulate the production of free radicals. Some studies have shown that kidney inflammation is serious in promoting the development and progression of DN. Inflammatory factors which are activated by the metabolic, biochemical, and hemodynamic derangements are known to exist in the diabetic kidney. This review discusses facts for oxidative stress and inflammatory factors in DN and encompasses the role of immune and inflammatory cells, inflammatory cytokines, and stress oxidative factors.

27908503|t|Cobalt-60 Machines and Medical Linear Accelerators: Competing Technologies for External Beam Radiotherapy
27908503|a|Medical linear accelerators (linacs) and cobalt-60 machines are both mature technologies for external beam radiotherapy. A comparison is made between these two technologies in terms of infrastructure and maintenance, dosimetry, shielding requirements, staffing, costs, security, patient throughput and clinical use. Infrastructure and maintenance are more demanding for linacs due to the complex electric componentry. In dosimetry, a higher beam energy, modulated dose rate and smaller focal spot size mean that it is easier to create an optimised treatment with a linac for conformal dose coverage of the tumour while sparing healthy organs at risk. In shielding, the requirements for a concrete bunker are similar for cobalt-60 machines and linacs but extra shielding and protection from neutrons are required for linacs. Staffing levels can be higher for linacs and more staff training is required for linacs. Life cycle costs are higher for linacs, especially multi-energy linacs. Security is more complex for cobalt-60 machines because of the high activity radioactive source. Patient throughput can be affected by source decay for cobalt-60 machines but poor maintenance and breakdowns can severely affect patient throughput for linacs. In clinical use, more complex treatment techniques are easier to achieve with linacs, and the availability of electron beams on high - energy linacs can be useful for certain treatments. In summary, there is no simple answer to the question of the choice of either cobalt-60 machines or linacs for radiotherapy in low- and middle-income countries. In fact a radiotherapy department with a combination of technologies, including orthovoltage X-ray units, may be an option. Local needs, conditions and resources will have to be factored into any decision on technology taking into account the characteristics of both forms of teletherapy, with the primary goal being the sustainability of the radiotherapy service over the useful lifetime of the equipment.

27908539|t|Design, synthesis, molecular docking, anti-Proteus mirabilis and urease inhibition of new fluoroquinolone carboxylic acid derivatives
27908539|a|New hydroxamic acid, hydrazide and amide derivatives of ciprofloxacin in addition to their analogues of levofloxacin were prepared and identified by different spectroscopic techniques. Some of the prepared compounds revealed good activity against the urease splitting bacteria, Proteus mirabilis. The urease inhibitory activity was investigated using indophenol method. Most of the tested compounds showed better activity than the reference acetohydroxamic acid (AHA). The ciprofloxacin hydrazide derivative 3a and levofloxacin hydroxamic acid 7 experienced the highest activity (IC50 =1.22μM and 2.20μM, respectively). Molecular docking study revealed high spontaneous binding ability of the tested compounds to the active site of urease.

27909143|t|Interobserver and Intraobserver Reliability of Clinical Assessments in Knee Osteoarthritis
27909143|a|Clinical examination of the knee is subject to measurement error. The aim of this analysis was to determine interobserver and intraobserver reliability of commonly used clinical tests in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). We studied subjects with symptomatic knee OA who were participants in an open-label clinical trial of intraarticular steroid therapy. Following standardization of the clinical test procedures, 2 clinicians assessed 25 subjects independently at the same visit, and the same clinician assessed 88 subjects over an interval period of 2-10 weeks; in both cases prior to the steroid intervention. Clinical examination included assessment of bony enlargement, crepitus, quadriceps wasting, knee effusion, joint-line and anserine tenderness, and knee range of movement (ROM). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), estimated kappa (κ), weighted kappa (κω), and Bland-Altman plots were used to determine interobserver and intraobserver levels of agreement. Using Landis and Koch criteria, interobserver κ scores were moderate for patellofemoral joint (κ = 0.53) and anserine tenderness (κ = 0.48); good for bony enlargement (κ = 0.66), quadriceps wasting (κ = 0.78), crepitus (κ = 0.78), medial tibiofemoral joint tenderness (κ = 0.76), and effusion assessed by ballottement (κ = 0.73) and bulge sign (κω = 0.78); and excellent for lateral tibiofemoral joint tenderness (κ = 1.00), flexion (ICC = 0.97), and extension (ICC = 0.87) ROM. Intraobserver κ scores were moderate for lateral tibiofemoral joint tenderness (κ = 0.60); good for crepitus (κ = 0.78), effusion assessed by ballottement test (κ = 0.77), patellofemoral joint (κ = 0.66), medial tibiofemoral joint (κ = 0.64), and anserine tenderness (κ = 0.73); and excellent for effusion assessed by bulge sign (κω = 0.83), bony enlargement (κ = 0.98), quadriceps wasting (κ = 0.83), flexion (ICC = 0.99), and extension (ICC = 0.96) ROM. Among individuals with symptomatic knee OA, the reliability of clinical examination of the knee was at least good for the majority of clinical signs of knee OA.

27913319|t|Assessing the benefits of targeted drug delivery by nanocarriers: A partico/pharmacokinetic framework
27913319|a|An in vivo kinetic framework is introduced to analyze and predict the quantitative advantage of using nanocarriers to deliver drugs, especially anticancer agents, compared to administering the same drugs in their free form. This framework recognizes three levels of kinetics. First is the particokinetics associated with deposition of nanocarriers into tissues associated with drug effect and toxicity, their residence inside those tissues, and elimination of the nanocarriers from the body. Second is the release pattern in time of free drug from the nanocarriers. Third is the pharmacokinetics of free drug, as it relates to deposition and elimination processes in the target and toxicity associated tissues, and total body clearance. A figure of merit, the drug targeting index (DTI), is used to quantitate the benefit of nanocarrier based drug delivery by considering the effects of preferential deposition of nanoparticles into target tissues and relative avoidance of tissues associated with drug toxicity, compared to drug that is administered in its free form. General methods are derived for calculating DTI when appropriate particokinetic, pharmacokinetic, and drug release rate information is available, and it is shown that relatively simple algebraic forms result when some common assumptions are made. This approach may find use in developing and selecting nanocarrier formulations, either for populations or for individuals.

27914462|t|Recombinant MHC Tetramers for Isolation of Virus - Specific CD8(+) Cells from Healthy Donors: Potential Approach for Cell Therapy of Posttransplant Cytomegalovirus Infection
27914462|a|Patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation have a high risk of cytomegalovirus reactivation, which in the absence of T-cell immunity can result in the development of an acute inflammatory reaction and damage of internal organs. Transfusion of the virus-specific donor T-lymphocytes represents an alternative to a highly toxic and often ineffective antiviral therapy. Potentially promising cell therapy approach comprises transfusion of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, specific to the viral antigens, immediately after their isolation from the donor's blood circulation without any in vitro expansion. Specific T-cells could be separated from potentially alloreactive lymphocytes using recombinant major histocompatibility complex (MHC) multimers, carrying synthetic viral peptides. Rapid transfusion of virus - specific T-cells to patients has several crucial advantages in comparison with methods based on the in vitro expansion of the cells. About 30% of hematopoietic stem cell donors and 46% of transplant recipients at the National Research Center for Hematology were carriers of the HLA-A*02 allele. Moreover, 94% of Russian donors have an immune response against the cytomegalovirus (CMV). Using recombinant HLA-A*02 multimers carrying an immunodominant cytomegalovirus peptide (NLV), we have shown that the majority of healthy donors have pronounced T-cell immunity against this antigen, whereas shortly after the transplantation the patients do not have specific T-lymphocytes. The donor cells have the immune phenotype of memory cells and can be activated and proliferate after stimulation with the specific antigen. Donor lymphocytes can be substantially enriched to significant purity by magnetic separation with recombinant MHC multimers and are not activated upon cocultivation with the antigen -presenting cells from HLA - incompatible donors without addition of the specific antigen. This study demonstrated that strong immune response to CMV of healthy donors and prevalence of HLA-A*02 allele in the Russian population make it possible to isolate a significant number of virus-specific cells using HLA-A*02-NLV multimers. After the transfusion, these cells should protect patients from CMV without development of allogeneic immune response.

27914587|t|Outcomes of chest wall resections in pediatric sarcoma patients
27914587|a|Chest wall tumors in pediatric patients are rare. This study evaluates outcomes in pediatric patients who have undergone chest wall resections secondary to sarcomas. A retrospective review was performed for patients <19years old who underwent chest wall resections for sarcoma 1999-2014 at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Of 44 patients, Ewing's sarcoma (n=18) and osteosarcoma (n=16) were most common. Other sarcomas included synovial sarcoma, chondrosarcoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma. Gore-Tex ® or a Marlex™ mesh and methyl methacrylate sandwich was used in 22 patients, and 9 children did not require reconstruction. Twenty-four (54.5%) patients had normal activity, 3 (6.8%) had occasional discomfort, 2 (4.5%) had pain impairing function, 7 (15.9%) required medication or physical therapy for impairment, and 8 (18.2%) needed additional surgery. Five children (11.4%) developed scoliosis, and all of these patients had posterior rib tumors. Median overall survival for the entire cohort was 41.9±11.82 months. Histology (p=0.003), location of tumor on the ribs (p=0.007), and surgical margins (p=0.011) were significantly associated with overall survival. Tumors on the middle and posterior (p=0.003) portions of the ribs had a lower chance of death. Scoliosis is more common in posterior rib resections. Histology, location of the tumor, and surgical margins impact survival, but, type of reconstruction does not. III. Treatment Study.

27914987|t|Tetrabromobisphenol A activates the hepatic interferon pathway in rats
27914987|a|Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) is a widely used flame retardant in printed circuit boards, paper, and textiles. In a two-year study, TBBPA showed evidence of uterine tumors in female Wistar-Han rats and liver and colon tumors in B6C3F1 mice. In order to gain further insight into early gene and pathway changes leading to cancer, we exposed female Wistar Han rats to TBBPA at 0, 25, 250, or 1000mg/kg (oral gavage in corn oil, 5×/ week) for 13 weeks. Because at the end of the TBBPA exposure period, there were no treatment-related effects on body weights, liver or uterus lesions, and liver and uterine organ weights were within 10% of controls, only the high dose animals were analyzed. Analysis of the hepatic and uterine transcriptomes showed TBBPA -induced changes primarily in the liver (1000mg/kg), with 159 transcripts corresponding to 132 genes differentially expressed compared to controls (FDR=0.05). Pathway analysis showed activation of interferon (IFN) and metabolic networks. TBBPA induced few molecular changes in the uterus. Activation of the interferon pathway in the liver occurred after 13-weeks of TBBPA exposure, and with longer term TBBPA exposure this may lead to immunomodulatory changes that contribute to carcinogenic processes.

27916672|t|Famous faces and voices: Differential profiles in early right and left semantic dementia and in Alzheimer's disease
27916672|a|Famous face and voice recognition is reported to be impaired both in semantic dementia (SD) and in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), although more severely in the former. In AD a coexistence of perceptual impairment in face and voice processing has also been reported and this could contribute to the altered performance in complex semantic tasks. On the other hand, in SD both face and voice recognition disorders could be related to the prevalence of atrophy in the right temporal lobe (RTL). The aim of the present study was twofold: (1) to investigate famous faces and voices recognition in SD and AD to verify if the two diseases show a differential pattern of impairment, resulting from disruption of different cognitive mechanisms; (2) to check if face and voice recognition disorders prevail in patients with atrophy mainly affecting the RTL. To avoid the potential influence of primary perceptual problems in face and voice recognition, a pool of patients suffering from early SD and AD were administered a detailed set of tests exploring face and voice perception. Thirteen SD (8 with prevalence of right and 5 with prevalence of left temporal atrophy) and 25 CE patients, who did not show visual and auditory perceptual impairment, were finally selected and were administered an experimental battery exploring famous face and voice recognition and naming. Twelve SD patients underwent cerebral PET imaging and were classified in right and left SD according to the onset modality and to the prevalent decrease in FDG uptake in right or left temporal lobe respectively. Correlation of PET imaging and famous face and voice recognition was performed. Results showed a differential performance profile in the two diseases, because AD patients were significantly impaired in the naming tests, but showed preserved recognition, whereas SD patients were profoundly impaired both in naming and in recognition of famous faces and voices. Furthermore, face and voice recognition disorders prevailed in SD patients with RTL atrophy, who also showed a conceptual impairment on the Pyramids and Palm Trees test more important in the pictorial than in the verbal modality. Finally, in 12 SD patients in whom PET was available, a strong correlation between FDG uptake and face-to-name and voice-to-name matching data was found in the right but not in the left temporal lobe. The data support the hypothesis of a different cognitive basis for impairment of face and voice recognition in the two dementias and suggest that the pattern of impairment in SD may be due to a loss of semantic representations, while a defect of semantic control, with impaired naming and preserved recognition might be hypothesized in AD. Furthermore, the correlation between face and voice recognition disorders and RTL damage are consistent with the hypothesis assuming that in the RTL person -specific knowledge may be mainly based upon non-verbal representations.

27917468|t|Dry skin conditions are related to the recovery rate of skin temperature after cold stress rather than to blood flow
27917468|a|Cutaneous blood flow plays an important role in the thermoregulation, oxygen supply, and nutritional support necessary to maintain the skin. However, there is little evidence for a link between blood flow and skin physiology. Therefore, we conducted surveys of healthy volunteers to determine the relationship (s) between dry skin properties and cutaneous vascular function. Water content of the stratum corneum, transepidermal water loss, and visual dryness score were investigated as dry skin parameters. Cutaneous blood flow in the resting state, the recovery rate (RR) of skin temperature on the hand after a cold-stress test, and the responsiveness of facial skin blood flow to local cooling were examined as indices of cutaneous vascular functions. The relationships between dry skin parameters and cutaneous vascular functions were assessed. The RR correlated negatively with the visual dryness score of skin on the leg but correlated positively with water content of the stratum corneum on the arm. No significant correlation between the resting state of blood flow and dry skin parameters was observed. In both the face and the body, deterioration in skin dryness from summer to winter was significant in subjects with low RR. The RR correlated well with the responsiveness of facial skin blood flow to local cooling, indicating that the RR affects systemic dry skin conditions. These results suggest that the RR but not blood flow at the resting state is associated with dry skin conditions and is involved in skin homeostasis during seasonal environmental changes.

27919226|t|Molar loss and powder diet leads to memory deficit and modifies the mRNA expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the hippocampus of adult mice
27919226|a|It is known that tooth loss is known to be a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease and soft diet feeding induces memory impairment. Recent studies have shown that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is associated with tooth loss or soft diet in young animal model, and that BDNF expression is decreased in patients with Alzheimer's disease. However, single or combined effect of tooth loss and/or soft diet on brain function has not fully understood. Here we examined the effect of molar loss and powder diet on memory ability and the expression of BDNF mRNA in the hippocampus of adult C57BL/6J mice. Twenty eight-weeks-old C57BL/6J mice were divided into intact molar group and extracted molar group. They were randomly divided into the I/S group (Intact upper molar teeth / Solid diet feeding), the E/S group (Extracted upper molar teeth / Solid diet feeding), the I/P group (Intact upper molar teeth / Powder diet feeding), and the E/P group (Extracted upper molar teeth / Powder diet feeding). The observation periods were 4 and 16-week. To analyze the memory ability, the step-through passive avoidance test was conducted. BDNF-related mRNA in the hippocampus was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). At 4 weeks later, we performed memory test and isolated brains to analyze. There were no differences in memory function and BDNF mRNA level between these four groups. However, at 16 weeks later, E/S and E/P group showed memory impairment, and decreased level of BDNF mRNA. Whereas, the powder diet had no effect on memory function and BDNF mRNA level even at 16 weeks later. These results suggest that the effect of molar loss and powder diet on memory function and BDNF mRNA levels were different, molar loss may have a greater long-term effect on memory ability than powder diet does.

27920947|t|The Daniel K. Inouye College of Pharmacy Scripts: Poha Berry (Physalis peruviana) with Potential Anti-inflammatory and Cancer Prevention Activities
27920947|a|The Daniel K. Inouye College of Pharmacy, during a historic event in Spring 2016, graduated the first two students in the Pacific region to earn a PhD in pharmaceutical sciences at the University of Hawai'i at Hilo. The college offers PhD programs in these five disciplines: Cancer Biology, Medicinal Chemistry, Pharmaceutics, Pharmacognosy, and Pharmacology. One of the Pharmacognosy dissertations focused on plant-derived natural products with potential anti-inflammatory and cancer chemopreventive activities. Physalis peruviana (Pp) L. originated in tropical South America. It has become naturalized and is found readily on the Island of Hawai'i. The edible fruits are commonly known as cape gooseberry or poha in Hawai'i. In part of our study, three new withanolides, physaperuvin G (1), physaperuvins I-J (2-3), along with four known withanolides, namely, 4β-hydroxywithanolide E (4), withaperuvin C (5), and physalactone (6), coagulin (7) were isolated from the aerial parts of P. peruviana. In addition, two known compounds, phyperunolide F (8), and withanolide S (9), were isolated and identified from the poha berry fruits. The structures and absolute stereochemistry of new compounds from poha were elucidated by several spectroscopy methods: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and mass spectrometry analyses. All isolated poha compounds (aerial parts and fruits) were evaluated for their anti-inflammatory activity with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cells, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)-activated nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) with transfected human embryonic kidney cells 293. Most of the isolated natural compounds showed activity with these assays. Additional studies were performed with models of colon cancer. Specifically, 4β-hydroxywithanolide E (4HWE) inhibited the growth of colon cancer monolayer and spheroid cultures. The compound induced cell cycle arrest at low concentrations and apoptosis at higher concentrations. These data suggest the ingestion of poha berries may have some effect on the prevalence of colon cancer. Additionally, poha isolates compounds were evaluated for their growth inhibitory effects with U251MG glioblastoma and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells that harbor aberrantly-active signal transducer and activation of transcription 3 (STAT3), compared to normal NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts. This work has led to the filing of three provisional patents with the University of Hawai'i Office of Technology Transfer and Economic Development.

27922526|t|Air Pollutant Exposure Within a Few Days of Delivery and Placental Abruption in Japan
27922526|a|Placental abruption is an emergency obstetric complication. Although the etiology of abruption is not fully understood, acute stimuli, such as ischemia and/or inflammation, are associated with rupture of the decidual artery, resulting in placental separation. Ischemia and inflammation are acute biologic effects of air pollution. Using a case-crossover design, we tested the hypothesis that a short-term increase in exposure to air pollutants is a potential trigger of placental abruption. We received data for western Japan (Kyushu-Okinawa Districts) from the Japan Perinatal Registry Network database. From 2005 to 2010, 821 singleton pregnant women with placental abruption were identified. We assigned daily concentrations of air pollutants, including nitrogen dioxide (NO2), suspended particulate matter, ozone, and sulfur dioxide (SO2), from the nearest monitoring station to the respective delivery hospital of each woman. Because information on the onset day of abruption was not obtained, we assumed the case day to be 1 day before the day of delivery. Exposure to NO2 at 2 days' lag was associated with placental abruption (temperature adjusted odds ratio per 10 ppb increase = 1.4; 95% confidence interval = 1.1, 1.8). The association patterns were similar, when we restricted to participants who delivered by emergency cesarean (1.4, 1.1, 1.9), or who delivered after 35 weeks of gestation (1.4, 1.0, 2.0). There was no association with suspended particulate matter, ozone, or SO2. We observed an association between NO2 exposure at 2 days before the day of delivery and placental abruption in pregnant Japanese women.

27924297|t|Datasets for the validation of the " in vivo " siRNA - silencing of CD40 and for the detection of new markers of atherosclerosis progression in ApoE - deficient mice
27924297|a|Data presented in this Data in Brief article correspond to the article " in vivo " silencing of CD40 reduces progression of experimental atherogenesis through a NFκB / miR-125b axis and reveals new potential mediators in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis " (M. Hueso, L. De Ramon, E. Navarro, E. Ripoll, J.M. Cruzado, J.M. Grinyo, J. Torras, 2016) [1]. Here, we describe the validation of the silencing of CD40 expression with a specific siRNA in ApoE(-/-) mouse aortas, and its systemic effects on splenic lymphocytic subpopulations as well as on the infiltration of aortic intima by F4/80(+), galectin-3(+) macrophages or by NF-κB(+) cells. We also show the output of a Gene Ontology and TLDA analysis which allowed the detection of potential mediators of atherosclerosis progression. We provide the scientific community with a set of genes whose expression is increased during atherosclerosis progression but downregulated upon CD40 silencing.

27927071|t|Investigation on evaluation criteria of backwashing effects for a pilot-scale BAF treating petrochemical wastewater
27927071|a|Parameters for evaluation criteria of air - water backwashing effect s of a pilot-scale biological aerated filter (BAF) treating petrochemical wastewater were investigated. The parameters included the suspended solids (SS) and specific oxygen uptake rate (SOUR) of the backwashing effluent, recovery of the BAF after backwashing, and the removal of the biomass / bioactivity attached on the filter media after backwashing. Results showed that the weight of the total sludge produced in the backwashing effluent increased with the increase in water - backwashing intensity, while the total SOUR of backwashing effluent rose notably with the increase of air - backwashing intensity. The optimal backwashing intensity of 14 L/(m(2)·s) for air and 4 L/(m(2)·s) for water were obtained. When the BAF was backwashed on this condition, the BAF recovered with high average removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonia nitrogen [Formula: see text] of 14.3% and 50.3%, respectively. High amount of biomass removal at 15.8% and low level of bioactivity removal at 8.8% attached on the filter media were also found. Concentrations of the benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and (o-, m-, p-) xylenes (BTEX) and phenol in the backwashed sludge were analyzed, showing that the backwashing was essential to remove some aromatic compounds adsorbed in the microorganisms.

27928742|t|Implementation of infrared and Raman modalities for glycosaminoglycan characterization in complex systems
27928742|a|Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are natural, linear and negatively charged heteropolysaccharides which are incident in every mammalian tissue. They consist of repeating disaccharide units, which are composed of either sulfated or non-sulfated monosaccharides. Depending on tissue types, GAGs exhibit structural heterogeneity such as the position and degree of sulfation or within their disaccharide units composition being heparin, heparan sulfate, chondroitine sulfate, dermatan sulfate, keratan sulfate, and hyaluronic acid. They are covalently linked to a core protein (proteoglycans) or as free chains (hyaluronan). GAGs affect cell properties and functions either by direct interaction with cell receptors or by sequestration of growth factors. These evidences of divert biological roles of GAGs make their characterization at cell and tissue levels of importance. Thus, non-invasive techniques are interesting to investigate, to qualitatively and quantitatively characterize GAGs in vitro in order to use them as diagnostic biomarkers and/or as therapeutic targets in several human diseases including cancer. Infrared and Raman microspectroscopies and imaging are sensitive enough to differentiate and classify GAG types and subtypes in spite of their close molecular structures. Spectroscopic markers characteristic of reference GAG molecules were identified. Beyond these investigations of the standard GAG spectral signature, infrared and Raman spectral signatures of GAG were searched in complex biological systems like cells. The aim of the present review is to describe the implementation of these complementary vibrational spectroscopy techniques, and to discuss their potentials, advantages and disadvantages for GAG analysis. In addition, this review presents new data as we show for the first time GAG infrared and Raman spectral signatures from conditioned media and live cells, respectively.

27932568|t|Targeting HIF2 in Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma
27932568|a|Inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor-suppressor protein (pVHL) is the signature "truncal" event in clear cell renal cell carcinoma, which is the most common form of kidney cancer. pVHL is part of a ubiquitin ligase the targets the α subunit of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) transcription factor for destruction when oxygen is available. Preclinical studies strongly suggest that deregulation of HIF, and particularly HIF2, drives pVHL -defective renal carcinogenesis. Although HIF2α was classically considered undruggable, structural and chemical work by Rick Bruick and Kevin Gardner at University of Texas Southwestern laid the foundation for the development of small molecule direct HIF2α antagonists (PT2385 and the related tool compound PT2399) by Peloton Therapeutics that block the dimerization of HIF2α with its partner protein ARNT1. These compounds inhibit clear cell renal cell carcinoma growth in preclinical models, and PT2385 has now entered the clinic. Nonetheless, the availability of such compounds, together with clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-based gene editing approaches, has revealed a previously unappreciated heterogeneity among clear cell renal carcinomas and patient -derived xenografts with respect to HIF2 dependence, suggesting that predictive biomarkers will be needed to optimize the use of such agents in the clinic.

27935120|t|Prevalence of high-risk human papillomavirus infection among women in Shaanxi province of China: A hospital -based investigation
27935120|a|This study aimed to investigate the characteristics of female high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection in Shaanxi province of China. A total of 14 111 women were enrolled for HPV genotyping test, and a cytology, and/or cervix biopsy were performed in partial women. Of these women, the HPV infection rate was 30.21%, and 26.73% were caused by HR-HPV. The most common HR-HPV genotypes were HPV-16, HPV-58, HPV-52, HPV-18, and HPV-31. The prevalence of HR-HPV among women older than 50 years was significantly higher than the other groups (P < 0.05). The main carcinogenic genotypes were HPV-16, HPV-18, HPV-58, HPV-52, and HPV-31. HPV-16 and HPV-18 combined caused 80.79% of cervical cancer cases. The infection with multiple HR-HPVs was not a risk factor for cervical lesions. In conclusion, HPV infection was common among women in Shaanxi province. Women older than 50 years were a high-risk group for HR-HPV infection and cervical cancer. HPV-16 and HPV-18 were the main carcinogenic genotypes in this region.

27935944|t|Novel and Lost Forests in the Upper Midwestern United States, from New Estimates of Settlement-Era Composition, Stem Density, and Biomass
27935944|a|EuroAmerican land-use and its legacies have transformed forest structure and composition across the United States (US). More accurate reconstructions of historical states are critical to understanding the processes governing past, current, and future forest dynamics. Here we present new gridded (8x8km) reconstructions of pre-settlement (1800s) forest composition and structure from the upper Midwestern US (Minnesota, Wisconsin, and most of Michigan), using 19th Century Public Land Survey System (PLSS), with estimates of relative composition, above-ground biomass, stem density, and basal area for 28 tree types. This mapping is more robust than past efforts, using spatially varying correction factors to accommodate sampling design, azimuthal censoring, and biases in tree selection. We compare pre-settlement to modern forests using US Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data to show the prevalence of lost forests (pre-settlement forests with no current analog), and novel forests (modern forests with no past analogs). Differences between pre-settlement and modern forests are spatially structured owing to differences in land-use impacts and accompanying ecological responses. Modern forests are more homogeneous, and ecotonal gradients are more diffuse today than in the past. Novel forest assemblages represent 28% of all FIA cells, and 28% of pre-settlement forests no longer exist in a modern context. Lost forests include tamarack forests in northeastern Minnesota, hemlock and cedar dominated forests in north-central Wisconsin and along the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and elm, oak, basswood and ironwood forests along the forest - prairie boundary in south central Minnesota and eastern Wisconsin. Novel FIA forest assemblages are distributed evenly across the region, but novelty shows a strong relationship to spatial distance from remnant forests in the upper Midwest, with novelty predicted at between 20 to 60km from remnants, depending on historical forest type. The spatial relationships between remnant and novel forests, shifts in ecotone structure and the loss of historic forest types point to significant challenges for land managers if landscape restoration is a priority. The spatial signals of novelty and ecological change also point to potential challenges in using modern spatial distributions of species and communities and their relationship to underlying geophysical and climatic attributes in understanding potential responses to changing climate. The signal of human settlement on modern forests is broad, spatially varying and acts to homogenize modern forests relative to their historic counterparts, with significant implications for future management.

27936362|t|Prevalence of Self-Reported Prescription Drug Use in a National Sample of U.S. Drivers
27936362|a|Drug -involved driving has become an increasing concern. Although the focus has been on illegal drugs, there is evidence that prescribed medications can impair driving ability. The purpose of this study was to determine the self-reported prevalence of prescription drug use, including medical and nonmedical use, among a nationally representative sample of drivers and to report related driver characteristics. As part of the 2013-2014 National Roadside Survey, drivers from 60 sites were randomly recruited and asked to complete a survey on prescription drug use. Almost 20% of drivers reported using a prescription drug within the past 2 days, with the most common drug class being sedatives (8.0%), followed by antidepressants (7.7%), narcotics (7.5%), and stimulants (3.9%). Drivers who reported prescription drug use were significantly more likely to be female, older, non-Hispanic White, and report disability. Three of four drivers who reported medication use (78.2%) said the drug was prescribed for their use; the odds of using without a prescription were significantly higher for males, Black/African American, and Hispanic drivers, and lower for older drivers. Among those with a prescription, taking more than prescribed was most common for narcotics (6.8%), followed by sedatives (4.8%), stimulants (3.8%), and antidepressants (1.5%). These findings help to identify drivers using potentially impairing prescription drugs, both medically and nonmedically, and may inform the targeting of interventions to reduce impaired driving related to medications.

27938482|t|Repetitive and Prolonged Omega-3 Fatty Acid Treatment After Traumatic Brain Injury Enhances Long-Term Tissue Restoration and Cognitive Recovery
27938482|a|Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the most disabling clinical conditions that could lead to neurocognitive disorders in survivors. Our group and others previously reported that prophylactic enrichment of dietary omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) markedly ameliorate cognitive deficits after TBI. However, it remains unclear whether a clinically relevant therapeutic regimen with n-3 PUFAs administered after TBI would still offer significant improvement of long-term cognitive recovery. In the present study, we employed the decline of spatial cognitive function as a main outcome after TBI to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of post - TBI n-3 PUFA treatment and the underlying mechanisms. Mice were subjected to sham operation or controlled cortical impact, followed by random assignment to receive the following four treatments: (1) vehicle control; (2) daily intraperitoneal injections of n-3 PUFAs for 2 weeks, beginning 2 h after TBI; (3) fish oil dietary supplementation throughout the study, beginning 1 day after TBI; or (4) combination of treatments (2) and (3). Spatial cognitive deficits and chronic brain tissue loss, as well as endogenous brain repair processes such as neurogenesis, angiogenesis, and oligodendrogenesis, were evaluated up to 35 days after TBI. The results revealed prominent spatial cognitive deficits and massive tissue loss caused by TBI. Among all mice receiving post-TBI n-3 PUFA treatments, the combined treatment of fish oil dietary supplement and n-3 PUFA injections demonstrated a reproducible beneficial effect in attenuating cognitive deficits although without reducing gross tissue loss. Mechanistically, the combined treatment promoted post-TBI restorative processes in the brain, including generation of immature neurons, microvessels, and oligodendrocytes, each of which was significantly correlated with the improved cognitive recovery. These results indicated that repetitive and prolonged n-3 PUFA treatments after TBI are capable of enhancing brain remodeling and could be developed as a potential therapy to treat TBI victims in the clinic.

27939139|t|Influence of yeast and lactic acid bacterium on the constituent profile of soy sauce during fermentation
27939139|a|Soy sauce is a Japanese traditional seasoning composed of various constituents that are produced by various microbes during a long-term fermentation process. Due to the complexity of the process, the investigation of the constituent profile during fermentation is difficult. Metabolomics, the comprehensive study of low molecular weight compounds in biological samples, is thought to be a promising strategy for deep understanding of the constituent contribution to food flavor characteristics. Therefore, metabolomics is suitable for the analysis of soy sauce fermentation. Unfortunately, only few and unrefined studies of soy sauce fermentation using metabolomics approach have been reported. Therefore, we investigated changes in low molecular weight hydrophilic and volatile compounds of soy sauce using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS)- based non-targeted metabolic profiling. The data were analyzed by statistical analysis to evaluate influences of yeast and lactic acid bacterium on the constituent profile. Consequently, our results suggested a novel finding that lactic acid bacterium affected the production of several constituents such as cyclotene, furfural, furfuryl alcohol and methional in the soy sauce fermentation process.

27941491|t|Low intensity sprint training with blood flow restriction improves 100 m dash
27941491|a|We investigated the effects of practical blood flow restriction (pBFR) of leg muscles during sprint training on the 100 m dash time in well-trained sport students. Participants performed 6x100 m sprints at 60-70% of their maximal 100 m sprinting speed twice a week for 6 weeks, either with (IG; n=12) or without pBFR (CG; n=12). The 100 m dash time significantly decreased more in the IG (-0.38±0.24 s) than in the CG (-0.16±0.17 s). The muscle thickness of the rectus femoris increased only in the IG, while no group by time interactions were found for the muscle thickness of the biceps femoris and the biceps brachii. The maximal isometric force, measured using a leg press, did not change in either group. However, the rate of force development improved in the IG. Growth hormone, testosterone, insulin-like growth factor 1, and cortisol concentrations did not significantly differ between both groups at any measurement time point (pre, 1 min, 20 min, 120 min, and 24 h after the six all-out sprints of the first training session). The muscle damage marker h-FABP increased significantly more in the CG than in the IG. The pBFR improved the 100 m dash time significantly more than low - intensity sprint interval training alone. Other noted benefits of training with pBFR were a decreased level of muscle damage, a greater increase of the rectus femoris muscle thickness, and a higher rate of force development. However, the tested hormones were unable to explain the additional beneficial effects.

27941576|t|Sedation of Patients With Disorders of Consciousness During Neuroimaging: Effects on Resting State Functional Brain Connectivity
27941576|a|To reduce head movement during resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging, post-coma patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) are frequently sedated with propofol. However, little is known about the effects of this sedation on the brain connectivity patterns in the damaged brain essential for differential diagnosis. In this study, we aimed to assess these effects. Using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging 3T data obtained over several years of scanning patients for diagnostic and research purposes, we employed a seed-based approach to examine resting state connectivity in higher-order (default mode, bilateral external control, and salience) and lower-order (auditory, sensorimotor, and visual) resting state networks and connectivity with the thalamus, in 20 healthy unsedated controls, 8 unsedated patients with DOC, and 8 patients with DOC sedated with propofol. The DOC groups were matched for age at onset, etiology, time spent in DOC, diagnosis, standardized behavioral assessment scores, movement intensities, and pattern of structural brain injury (as assessed with T1-based voxel-based morphometry). DOC were associated with severely impaired resting state network connectivity in all but the visual network. Thalamic connectivity to higher-order network regions was also reduced. Propofol administration to patients was associated with minor further decreases in thalamic and insular connectivity. Our findings indicate that connectivity decreases associated with propofol sedation, involving the thalamus and insula, are relatively small compared with those already caused by DOC -associated structural brain injury. Nonetheless, given the known importance of the thalamus in brain arousal, its disruption could well reflect the diminished movement obtained in these patients. However, more research is needed on this topic to fully address the research question.

27942049|t|Potassium depletion stimulates Na-Cl cotransporter via phosphorylation and inactivation of the ubiquitin ligase Kelch-like 3
27942049|a|Kelch-like 3 (KLHL3) is a component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that regulates blood pressure by targeting With-No-Lysine (WNK) kinases for degradation. Mutations in KLHL3 cause constitutively increased renal salt reabsorption and impaired K(+) secretion, resulting in hypertension and hyperkalemia. Although clinical studies have shown that dietary K(+) intake affects blood pressure, the mechanisms have been obscure. In this study, we demonstrate that the KLHL3 ubiquitin ligase complex is involved in the low- K(+) -mediated activation of Na-Cl cotransporter (NCC) in the kidney. In the distal convoluted tubules of mice eating a low-K(+) diet, we found increased KLHL3 phosphorylation at S433 (KLHL3(S433-P)), a modification that impairs WNK binding, and also reduced total KLHL3 levels. These changes are accompanied by the accumulation of the target substrate WNK4, and activation of the downstream kinases SPAK (STE20 / SPS1 -related proline-alanine-rich protein kinase) and OSR1 (oxidative stress-responsive 1), resulting in NCC phosphorylation and its accumulation at the plasma membrane. Increased phosphorylation of S433 was explained by increased levels of active, phosphorylated protein kinase C (but not protein kinase A), which directly phosphorylates S433. Moreover, in HEK cells expressing KLHL3 and WNK4, we showed that the activation of protein kinase C by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate induces KLHL3(S433-P) and increases WNK4 levels by abrogating its ubiquitination. These data demonstrate the role of KLHL3 in low- K(+) -mediated induction of NCC; this physiologic adaptation reduces distal electrogenic Na(+) reabsorption, preventing further renal K(+) loss but promoting increased blood pressure.

27942150|t|The relationship between thoracic configuration and changes in volumes of hemithoraces in upright sitting
27942150|a|[Purpose] Some patients with respiratory disease exhibit asymmetrical movement of the thorax. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship of thoracic configuration with changes in thoracic volume in 13 sedentary healthy men. [Subjects and Methods] In upright sitting, 84 reflective markers were placed on the anterior and posterior aspects of the trunk to record thoracic volume during quiet and volitional deep breathing. Using a three-dimensional motion analyzer, the difference in volume within the upper and lower hemithoraces was measured. For calculation of the thoracic volume six imaginary hexahedra were visualized for the upper and lower thorax using four reflective markers for each on the anterior and posterior aspects of the thorax. Each hexahedron was then divided into three imaginary triangular pyramids to calculate positional vectors. Finally, the volume for both the hexahedra and triangular pyramids was calculated. Four thoracic volumes were obtained. [Results] The findings showed that the left upper and right lower hemithorax yielded significantly larger thoracic volumes. [Conclusion] In conclusion the left upper and right lower hemithoraces were found to expand more than their corresponding sides. Understanding the characteristics of thoracic excursion during quiet and volitional deep breathing could be of value in assessment and instruction of breathing techniques to patients.

27951480|t|Development of the four-item Letter and Shape Drawing test (LSD-4): A brief bedside test of visuospatial function
27951480|a|Conventional bedside tests of visuospatial function such as the Clock Drawing (CDT) and Intersecting Pentagons (IPT) lack consistency in delivery and interpretation. We compared performance on a novel test of visuospatial ability - the LSD - with the IPT, CDT and MMSE in 180 acute elderly medical inpatients [mean age 79.7±7.1 (range 62-96); 91 females (50.6%)]. 124 (69%) scored ≤23 on the MMSE; 60 with mild (score 18-23) and 64 with severe (score ≤17) impairment. 78 (43%) scored ≥6 on the CDT, while for the IPT, 87 (47%) scored ≥4. The CDT and IPT agreed on the classification of 138 patients (77%) with modest- strong agreement with the MMSE categories. Correlation between the LSD and visuospatial tests was high. A four-item version of the LSD incorporating items 1,10,12,15 had high correlation with the LSD-15 and strong association with MMSE categories. The LSD-4 provides a brief and easily interpreted bedside test of visuospatial function that has high coverage of elderly patients with neurocognitive impairment, good agreement with conventional tests of visuospatial ability and favourable ability to identify significant cognitive impairment.

27960292|t|Ankaflavin and Monascin Induce Apoptosis in Activated Hepatic Stellate Cells through Suppression of the Akt / NF-κB / p38 Signaling Pathway
27960292|a|The increased proliferation of activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) is associated with hepatic fibrosis and excessive extracellular matrix (ECM)- protein production. We examined the inhibitory effects of the Monascus purpureus -fermented metabolites, ankaflavin and monascin (15 and 30 μM), on the Akt / nuclear factor (NF)-κB and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways in HSC-T6 (activated hepatic stellate cell line). Ankaflavin and monascin (30 μM) induced apoptosis and significantly inhibited cell growth (cell viabilities: 80.2 ± 5.43% and 62.8 ± 8.20%, respectively, versus control cells; P < 0.05). Apoptosis and G1 phase arrest (G1 phase percentages: 76.1 ± 2.85% and 79.9 ± 1.80%, respectively, versus control cells 65.9 ± 4.94%; P < 0.05) correlated with increased p53 and p21 levels and caspase 3 activity and decreased cyclin D1 and Bcl-2-family protein levels (P < 0.05, all cases). The apoptotic effects of ankaflavin and monascin were HSC-T6 - specific, suggesting their potential in treating liver fibrosis.

27965132|t|Low-Volume vs High-Volume Centers and Management of Fournier's Gangrene in Washington State
27965132|a|Fournier's gangrene (FG) is a life-threatening infection affecting the perineum and genitals. Complex patient management often necessitates transfer to tertiary centers. We aimed to characterize hospital transfer patterns and assess morbidity among patients with FG in Washington State. The Washington State Comprehensive Hospital Abstract Reporting System includes claims from all hospital discharges in Washington. We identified patients with FG between 2007 and 2013, based on diagnosis and treatment codes. Analyses were stratified by center volume (low-volume centers [LVCs] or high-volume centers [HVCs]), and transfer status. Variables of interest included number of debridements, septic shock, acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure, length of hospitalization, and death. We identified 165 FG patients. Only 1 HVC treated more than 2 FG patients per year. Overall mortality was 6.7%. Most patients (57%) were treated entirely at LVCs; 87% of patients treated at the HVC were transferred from an LVC. High-volume center -treated patients had similar baseline comorbidities (p = 0.77) and similar mortality (p = 0.87), despite higher rates of septic shock (p < 0.01) and respiratory failure (p = 0.01) compared with LVC patients. Among HVC - transferred patients, immediate compared with delayed transfer was associated with fewer debridements (p < 0.01), lower rates of septic shock (p = 0.05), and acute renal failure (p = 0.04). Patients treated at the HVC were more acutely ill, yet mortality was similar compared with patients treated solely at LVCs, suggesting a benefit to transfer of high acuity patients. Immediate vs delayed transfer may benefit FG health outcomes; however, this may also reflect greater disease acuity of patients with delayed transfer status.

27965450|t|Functional Characterization of Pneumocystis carinii Inositol Transporter 1
27965450|a|Fungi in the genus Pneumocystis live in the lungs of mammals, where they can cause a fatal pneumonia (PCP [Pneumocystis pneumonia]) in hosts with compromised immune systems. The absence of a continuous in vitro culture system for any species of Pneumocystis has led to limited understanding of these fungi, especially for the discovery of new therapies. We recently reported that Pneumocystis carinii, Pneumocystis murina, and most significantly, Pneumocystis jirovecii lack both enzymes necessary for myo-inositol biosynthesis but contain genes with homologies to fungal myo-inositol transporters. Since myo-inositol is essential for eukaryotic viability, the primary transporter, ITR1, was functionally and structurally characterized in P. carinii The predicted structure of P. carinii ITR1 (PcITR1) contained 12 transmembrane alpha-helices with intracellular C and N termini, consistent with other inositol transporters. The apparent Km was 0.94 ± 0.08 (mean ± standard deviation), suggesting that myo-inositol transport in P. carinii is likely through a low-affinity, highly selective transport system, as no other sugars or inositol stereoisomers were significant competitive inhibitors. Glucose transport was shown to use a different transport system. The myo-inositol transport was distinct from mammalian transporters, as it was not sodium dependent and was cytochalasin B resistant. Inositol transport in these fungi offers an attractive new drug target because of the reliance of the fungi on its transport, clear differences between the mammalian and fungal transporters, and the ability of the host to both synthesize and transport this critical nutrient, predicting low toxicity of potential inhibitors to the fungal transporter. myo-Inositol is a sugarlike nutrient that is essential for life in most organisms. Humans and microbes alike can obtain it by making it, which involves only 2 enzymes, by taking it from the environment by a transport process, or by recycling it from other cellular constituents. Inspection of the genomes of the pathogenic fungi of the genus Pneumocystis showed that these pneumonia - causing parasites could not make myo-inositol, as they lacked the 2 enzymes. Instead, we found evidence of inositol transporters, which would import the sugar from the lungs where the fungi reside. In the present report, we characterized the transport of myo-inositol in the fungus and found that the transporter was highly selective for myo-inositol and did not transport any other molecules. The transport was distinct from that in mammalian cells, and since mammals can both make and transport myo-inositol, while Pneumocystis fungi must transport it, this process offers a potential new drug target.

27976878|t|Worldwide Occurrence of Mycotoxins in Cereals and Cereal - Derived Food Products: Public Health Perspectives of Their Co-occurrence
27976878|a|Cereal grains and their processed food products are frequently contaminated with mycotoxins. Among many, five major mycotoxins of aflatoxins, ochratoxins, fumonisins, deoxynivalenol, and zearalenone are of significant public health concern as they can cause adverse effects in humans. Being airborne or soilborne, the cosmopolitan nature of mycotoxigenic fungi contribute to the worldwide occurrence of mycotoxins. On the basis of the global occurrence data reported during the past 10 years, the incidences and maximum levels in raw cereal grains were 55% and 1642 μg/kg for aflatoxins, 29% and 1164 μg/kg for ochratoxin A, 61% and 71,121 μg/kg for fumonisins, 58% and 41,157 μg/kg, for deoxynivalenol, and 46% and 3049 μg/kg for zearalenone. The concentrations of mycotoxins tend to be lower in processed food products; the incidences varied depending on the individual mycotoxins, possibly due to the varying stability during processing and distribution of mycotoxins. It should be noted that more than one mycotoxin, produced by a single or several fungal species, may occur in various combinations in a given sample or food. Most studies reported additive or synergistic effects, suggesting that these mixtures may pose a significant threat to public health, particularly to infants and young children. Therefore, information on the co-occurrence of mycotoxins and their interactive toxicity is summarized in this paper.

27979320|t|Locating the Seventh Cervical Spinous Process: Development and Validation of a Multivariate Model Using Palpation and Personal Information
27979320|a|The aim of this study was to develop and validate a multivariate prediction model, guided by palpation and personal information, for locating the seventh cervical spinous process (C7SP). A single-blinded, cross-sectional study at a primary to tertiary health care center was conducted for model development and temporal validation. One-hundred sixty participants were prospectively included for model development (n = 80) and time-split validation stages (n = 80). The C7SP was located using the thorax-rib static method (TRSM). Participants underwent chest radiography for assessment of the inner body structure located with TRSM and using radio-opaque markers placed over the skin. Age, sex, height, body mass, body mass index, and vertex-marker distanc e (DV-M) were used to predict the distance from the C7SP to the vertex (DV-C7). Multivariate linear regression modeling, limits of agreement plot, histogram of residues, receiver operating characteristic curves, and confusion tables were analyzed. The multivariate linear prediction model for DV-C7 (in centimeters) was DV-C7 = 0.986DV-M + 0.018(mass) + 0.014(age) - 1.008. Receiver operating characteristic curves had better discrimination of DV-C7 (area under the curve = 0.661; 95% confidence interval = 0.541-0.782; P = .015) than DV-M (area under the curve = 0.480; 95% confidence interval = 0.345-0.614; P = .761), with respective cutoff points at 23.40 cm (sensitivity = 41%, specificity = 63%) and 24.75 cm (sensitivity = 69%, specificity = 52%). The C7SP was correctly located more often when using predicted DV-C7 in the validation sample than when using the TRSM in the development sample: n = 53 (66%) vs n = 32 (40%), P < .001. Better accuracy was obtained when locating the C7SP by use of a multivariate model that incorporates palpation and personal information.

27983510|t|Comparison of Leishmania typing results obtained from 16 European clinical laboratories in 2014
27983510|a|Leishmaniasis is endemic in southern Europe, and in other European countries cases are diagnosed in travellers who have visited affected areas both within the continent and beyond. Prompt and accurate diagnosis poses a challenge in clinical practice in Europe. Different methods exist for identification of the infecting Leishmania species. Sixteen clinical laboratories in 10 European countries, plus Israel and Turkey, conducted a study to assess their genotyping performance. DNA from 21 promastigote cultures of 13 species was analysed blindly by the routinely used typing method. Five different molecular targets were used, which were analysed with PCR-based methods. Different levels of identification were achieved, and either the Leishmania subgenus, species complex, or actual species were reported. The overall error rate of strains placed in the wrong complex or species was 8.5%. Various reasons for incorrect typing were identified. The study shows there is considerable room for improvement and standardisation of Leishmania typing. The use of well validated standard operating procedures is recommended, covering testing, interpretation, and reporting guidelines. Application of the internal transcribed spacer 1 of the rDNA array should be restricted to Old World samples, while the heat-shock protein 70 gene and the mini-exon can be applied globally.

27983636|t|Scoparone Inhibits LPS - Simulated Inflammatory Response by Suppressing IRF3 and ERK in BV-2 Microglial Cells
27983636|a|Microglia activation and the release of various inflammatory cytokines are largely related to neurological diseases, including Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and other brain diseases. The suppression of microglial cells using natural bioactive compounds has become increasingly important for brain therapy owing to the expected beneficial effect of lower toxicity. Scoparone (6,7-dimethoxycoumarin), a major bioactive compound found in various plant parts, including the inner shell of chestnut (Castanea crenata), was evaluated on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- activated BV-2 microglia cells. The results indicated that scoparone suppresses the LPS - stimulated increase of neuroinflammatory responses and inhibited the pro-inflammatory cytokine production in the BV-2 microglial cells. A mechanistic study showed that scoparone specifically inhibited the LPS - stimulated activation via a major regulation of IRF-3 and a regulation of ERK, whereby the phosphorylation in the BV-2 microglial cells is blocked. These data suggest that scoparone has anti-neuroinflammatory effects in LPS - activated BV-2 microglial cells, and could possibly be used in the development of novel drugs for the prevention and treatment of neuroinflammatory diseases.

27987038|t|Efficient genome editing of differentiated renal epithelial cells
27987038|a|Recent advances in genome editing technologies have enabled the rapid and precise manipulation of genomes, including the targeted introduction, alteration, and removal of genomic sequences. However, respective methods have been described mainly in non-differentiated or haploid cell types. Genome editing of well-differentiated renal epithelial cells has been hampered by a range of technological issues, including optimal design, efficient expression of multiple genome editing constructs, attainable mutation rates, and best screening strategies. Here, we present an easily implementable workflow for the rapid generation of targeted heterozygous and homozygous genomic sequence alterations in renal cells using transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) system. We demonstrate the versatility of established protocols by generating novel cellular models for studying autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Furthermore, we show that cell culture-validated genetic modifications can be readily applied to mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) for the generation of corresponding mouse models. The described procedure for efficient genome editing can be applied to any cell type to study physiological and pathophysiological functions in the context of precisely engineered genotypes.

27988278|t|Right Ventricular Response During Exercise in Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
27988278|a|Right ventricular (RV) pump function is of essential clinical and prognostic importance in a variety of heart and lung diseases. While the evaluation of RV performance at rest has been implemented in the clinical setting, it is unknown whether this assessment during exercise may provide additional benefit. With this aim, we evaluated the exercise - induced pulmonary arterial systolic pressure (PASP) increase during exercise in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as an expression of RV contractile reserve. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) with synchronic echocardiography was performed in 81 patients. Patients were classified into two groups according to an exercise - induced PASP increase above 30mmHg (High PSAP) or below 30mmHg (Low PSAP) during maximal exercise. Patients were then followed for three years. Sixteen patients (20%) had low PSAP and 65 (80%) showed high PSAP. These were not significant clinical and functional differences. Low PSAP was associated with a significantly lower peak VO2 (mean (SD), 35 (2) % predicted) compared to high PSAP response (peak VO2 45 (3) % predicted), p=0.045. Factors associated with mortality were age and exercise - induced PASP. Seventeen patients died during the three years of follow-up (7 (39%) in the low PSAP group and only 10 (1%) in the high PSAP group, p=0.041). Cardiopulmonary exercise testing with a synchronic echocardiography may be a useful tool for the assessment of RV contractile reserve in severe COPD patients. Exercise - induced PSAP emerges as a possible prognostic factor in these patients.

27989992|t|Adverse outcomes in older adults attending emergency departments: a systematic review and meta-analysis of the Identification of Seniors At Risk (ISAR) screening tool
27989992|a|older adults are frequent users of emergency services and demonstrate high rates of adverse outcomes following emergency care. to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the Identification of Seniors At Risk (ISAR) screening tool, to determine its predictive value in identifying adults ≥65 years at risk of functional decline, unplanned emergency department (ED) readmission, emergency hospitalisation or death within 180 days after index ED visit / hospitalisation. a systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, EBSCO and the Cochrane Library to identify validation and impact analysis studies of the ISAR tool. A pre-specified ISAR score of ≥2 (maximum score 6 points) was used to identify patients at high risk of adverse outcomes. A bivariate random effects model generated pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity. Statistical heterogeneity was explored and methodological quality was assessed using validated criteria. thirty-two validation studies (n = 12,939) are included. At ≥2, the pooled sensitivity of the ISAR for predicting ED return, emergency hospitalisation and mortality at 6 months is 0.80 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70-0.87), 0.82 (95% CI 0.74-0.88) and 0.87 (95% CI 0.75-0.94), respectively, with a pooled specificity of 0.31 (95% CI 0.24-0.38), 0.32 (95% CI 0.24-0.41) and 0.35 (95% CI 0.26-0.44). Similar values are demonstrated at 30 and 90 days. Three heterogeneous impact analysis studies examined the clinical implementation of the ISAR and reported mixed findings across patient and process outcomes. the ISAR has modest predictive accuracy and may serve as a decision-making adjunct when determining which older adults can be safely discharged.

27991947|t|Ecohydrological modeling and environmental flow regime in the Formoso River, Minas Gerais State, Brazil
27991947|a|This paper aimed at determining the environmental flow regime in a 1 km stretch of the Formoso River, MG, using River2D model. To carry out the ecohydrological modeling, the following information was used: bathymetry, physical and hydraulic features, and the Habitat Suitability Index for species of the Hypostomus auroguttatus. In the River2D, the Weighted Usable Areas were determined from the average long-term streamflows with percentage from 10% to 100%. Those streamflows were simulated for the later construction of optimization matrices that maximize the habitat area throughout the year. For H. auroguttatus Juvenile, higher values of Weighted Usable Area were associated with the percentage of 60% and 70% of the average long-term streamflows in October and September, respectively. For H. auroguttatus Adult, the highest value of Weighted Usable Area was associated with the percentage of 100% of the average long-term streamflow in September. The environmental flows found for this stretch of the Formoso River varied over the year. The lowest environmental flow was observed in December (2.85 m3 s-1), while the highest was observed in May (4.13 m3 s-1). This paper shows the importance of ecohydrological studies in forming a basis for water resources management actions.

27992983|t|Risk factors for hepatitis C virus infection in the Colombian Caribbean coast: A case-control study
27992983|a|An estimated 6.8-8.9 million people are infected with hepatitis C virus in Latin America, of which less than 1% receives antiviral treatment. Studies so far in Colombia have attempted to determine the prevalence of the disease in some risk groups, thus preventing the identification of other factors potentially involved in the spread of the infection. To identify traditional and non-traditional risk factors for chronic hepatitis C in the Colombian Caribbean coast. This was a case-control study (1:3) matched by health care provider and age (± 10 years) conducted at the primary care level of gastroenterology and hepatology outpatient services. All patients with a positive ELISA underwent a confirmatory viral load test. A multivariate logistic regression analysis identified the independent predictors of infection. Blood transfusion (OR =159.2; 95% CI: 35.4-715; p<0.001) and history of hospitalization before 1994 (OR =4.7; 95% CI: 1.3-17.1; p=0.018) were identified as the only two independent predictors of infection. It is necessary to check the reproducibility of these results and to conduct cost-effectiveness studies before recommending their use in the design of new screening strategies.

27993519|t|Quo vadis G protein-coupled receptor ligands? A tool for analysis of the emergence of new groups of compounds over time
27993519|a|Exponential growth in the number of compounds with experimentally verified activity towards particular target has led to the emergence of various databases gathering data on biological activity. In this study, the ligands of family A of the G Protein-Coupled Receptors that are collected in the ChEMBL database were examined, and special attention was given to serotonin receptors. Sets of compounds were examined in terms of their appearance over time, they were mapped to the chemical space of drugs deposited in DrugBank, and the emergence of structurally new clusters of compounds was indicated. In addition, a tool for detailed analysis of the obtained visualizations was prepared and made available online at http://chem.gmum.net/vischem, which enables the investigation of chemical structures while referring to particular data points depicted in the figures and changes in compounds datasets over time.

27995352|t|Diabetes and breast cancer mortality in Black women
27995352|a|Breast cancer mortality is higher in Black women than in White women. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus is also higher, yet data on whether diabetes affects breast cancer mortality in this population are lacking. We investigated the relation of diabetes at the time of breast cancer diagnosis to breast cancer mortality in the Black Women's Health Study, a prospective cohort study. 1,621 Black women with invasive breast cancer diagnosed in 1995-2013 were followed by mailed questionnaires and searches of the National Death Index. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to compute hazard ratios (HRs) for diabetes in relation to breast cancer mortality and all-cause mortality, with adjustment for age, stage, treatment modality, estrogen receptor (ER) status, and body mass index. There were 368 deaths during follow-up, of which 273 were due to breast cancer. Breast cancer mortality was significantly increased in women who had been diagnosed with diabetes at least 5 years before breast cancer occurrence, HR 1.86 (95% CI 1.20-2.89), with elevations observed for both ER+ and ER- breast cancer. All-cause mortality was also higher in diabetics, with HRs of 1.54 (95% CI 1.12-2.07) overall and 2.26 (95% CI 1.62-3.15) for ≥5-year duration of diabetes relative to non-diabetics. Our results present the first solid evidence of a positive association of type 2 diabetes with breast cancer mortality in Black women. Given the higher prevalence and earlier onset of type 2 diabetes in Black women, it is likely that diabetes contributes to racial disparities in breast cancer mortality.

27998307|t|Neuro-Behcet disease presenting as a solitary cerebellar hemorrhagic lesion: a case report and review of the literature
27998307|a|Behcet's disease is a heterogeneous, multisystem, inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology. The classic triad of oral and genital ulcerations in conjunction with uveitis was originally described by the Turkish dermatologist Hulusi Behcet in 1937, but associated symptoms of the cardiovascular, central nervous, pulmonary, and gastrointestinal systems were later identified. In fact, Behcet's disease with neurological involvement (neuro-Behcet's disease) is not uncommon. Patients with neuro-Behcet's disease typically exhibit a diverse array of symptoms, most commonly in the brainstem and diencephalic regions. Herein, we report an unusual case of neuro-Behcet's disease in a patient who presented with a solitary cerebellar hemorrhage. A 39-year-old Asian woman was admitted to our hospital with complaints of a sudden speech difficulty that had manifested the same morning, and dizziness and mild vomiting experienced over the previous 3 days. Magnetic resonance images revealed target-like hemorrhagic lesions in the right hemisphere of the cerebellum. Risk factors that may result in cerebellar hemorrhage, such as high blood pressure or bleeding diathesis, were ruled out, and subsequent brain angiograms were normal. These findings suggest that the patient's cerebellar hemorrhage could have been due to intracranial vasculitis in a rare, if not unique, complication of neuro-Behcet's disease.

27999011|t|Intrinsic rifamycin resistance of Mycobacterium abscessus is mediated by ADP-ribosyltransferase MAB_0591
27999011|a|Rifampicin, a potent first-line TB drug of the rifamycin group, shows only little activity against the emerging pathogen Mycobacterium abscessus. Reportedly, bacterial resistance to rifampicin is associated with polymorphisms in the target gene rpoB or the presence of enzymes that modify and thereby inactivate rifampicin. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the MAB_0591 (arrMab)-encoded rifampicin ADP-ribosyltransferase (Arr_Mab) in innate high-level rifampicin resistance in M. abscessus. Recombinant Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains expressing MAB_0591 were generated, as was an M. abscessus deletion mutant deficient for MAB_0591. MIC assays were used to study susceptibility to rifampicin and C25 carbamate -modified rifamycin derivatives. Heterologous expression of MAB_0591 conferred rifampicin resistance to E. coli and M. tuberculosis Rifamycin MIC values were consistently lower for the M. abscessus ΔarrMab mutant as compared with the M. abscessus ATCC 19977 parental type strain. The rifamycin WT phenotype was restored after complementation of the M. abscessus ΔarrMab mutant with arrMab Further MIC data demonstrated that a C25 modification increases rifamycin activity in WT M. abscessus However, MIC studies in the M. abscessus ΔarrMab mutant suggest that C25 modified rifamycins are still subject to modification by Arr_Mab CONCLUSIONS: Our findings identify Arr_Mab as the major innate rifamycin resistance determinant of M. abscessus. Our data also indicate that Arr_Mab -mediated rifamycin resistance in M. abscessus can only in part be overcome by C25 carbamate modification.

28002691|t|The Silorane-based Resin Composites: A Review
28002691|a|This article aims to review the research done on the silorane-based resin composites (SBRC) regarding polymerization shrinkage and contraction stresses and their ability to improve the shortcomings of the methacrylate-based resin composites (MRBC). Special attention is given to their physical and mechanical properties, bond strength, marginal adaptation, and cusp deflection. The clinical significance of this material is critically appraised with a focus on the ability of SBRC to strengthen the tooth structure as a direct restorative material. A search of English peer-reviewed dental literature (2003-2015) from PubMed and MEDLINE databases was conducted with the terms " low shrinkage " and " silorane composites ." The list was screened, and 70 articles that were relevant to the objectives of this work were included.

Ectopic location of these adenomas is an extremely rare condition that may compromise the diagnosis and surgical success. We present the first case of an ectopic intracavernous ACTH-secreting macroadenoma totally resected with endoscopic endonasal surgery (EES). A 36 year old female presented with Cushing syndrome. Increased ACTH, serum cortisol and free urine cortisol levels were identified, however the pituitary MRI failed to reveal a pituitary tumor; instead, a parasellar lesion in the left cavernous sinus (CS) was noticed. Inferior petrosal sinus sampling demonstrated a significant central -to- peripheral and lateralized left-sided ACTH gradient. The patient underwent EES. No tumor was found in the sella, however, the left CS was widely explored and a tumor was found lateral to the paraclival segment of the carotid artery. There were no complications following EES. Pathology confirmed the diagnosis of an ACTH-secreting adenoma. During the immediately postoperative course serum cortisol levels dropped below 5 mcg/dl. Postoperative MRI demonstrated complete tumor resection. At 20 months follow-up, the patient remains in clinical and biochemical remission of Cushing's Disease. Only 12 cases of ectopic intracavernous ACTH-secreting adenomas have been reported to date and all were microadenomas. The presence of an ectopic ACTH-secreting macroadenoma in the CS represents a surgical challenge. EES is the ideal approach for complete resection of ectopic intracavernous adenomas allowing for a wide exploration of the CS with no surgical complications.

28005403|t|Preliminary Randomized Controlled Trial of Habit Reversal Training for Treatment of Hair Pulling in Youth
28005403|a|This study evaluated the treatment efficacy of habit reversal training (HRT) relative to treatment as usual (TAU) for children and adolescents aged 7-17 years with a primary diagnosis of trichotillomania (TTM). An initial assessment consisting of semistructured interviews and rating scales was conducted. Participants (N = 40, 85% female) meeting diagnostic criteria for TTM were randomized to either 8 weekly sessions of HRT by trained therapists or 8 weeks of TAU. One week after the final HRT session or final TAU week, patients completed a posttreatment assessment, followed by 1- and 3- month follow-up assessments. All assessments were conducted by a trained rater who was blinded to treatment condition. The group by time analysis of variance yielded a significant interaction on the National Institute of Mental Health - Trichotillomania Severity Scale Total Score (F1,38 = 16.47, p < 0.001, η(2)p = 0.30). The mean score decreased from 12.67 ± 4.60 at baseline to 5.62 ± 4.38 at posttreatment in the HRT group (t20 = 5.99, p < 0.001, d = 1.31), whereas the TAU group changed from 10.42 ± 4.35 to 9.32 ± 4.11 (t18 = 1.34, p = 0.20, d = 0.31). The Massachusetts General Hospital-Hair Pulling Scale Total Score decreased from 15.14 ± 3.86 at baseline to 7.14 ± 5.54 at posttreatment in the HRT group (t20 = 6.16, p < 0.001, d = 1.34); the TAU group changed from 14.16 ± 4.51 to 12.26 ± 4.34 (t18 = 1.50, p = 0.15, d = 0.34). On the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement, 16/21 participants (76%) were rated as treatment responders in the HRT group versus 4/19 (21%) in the TAU group (χ(2) = 12.13, p < 0.001, V = 0.55). At 1- month follow-up, 10-12 treatment responders who completed the assessment maintained improvement. At 3- month follow-up, six of eight maintained improvement. HRT can be an effective treatment for TTM in youth.

28005775|a|Clipping bilateral middle cerebral artery (bMCA) aneurysms via unilateral approach in a single-stage operation is considered as a challenge procedure. To our knowledge, there is no study in surgical management of patients with bMCA aneurysms by fully endoscope - controlled techniques. The author reported a patient with bMCA aneurysms who underwent aneurysms clipping via a unilateral supraorbital keyhole approach by endoscope - controlled microneurosurgery, and the patient had an uneventful postoperative course without neurologic impairment and complication. Furthermore, the author discussed the advantages and adaptation of endoscope - controlled clipping bMCA aneurysms via unilateral supraorbital keyhole approach.

28008561|t|Endpoints for screening thyroid cancer in the Republic of Korea: thyroid specialists ' perspectives
28008561|a|Cancer screening is aimed primarily at reducing deaths from the specific cancer. Thyroid-specific cancer mortality may be the most ambitious endpoint for obtaining estimates of screening effect. Numerous observations have accumulated over the years, indicating that thyroid cancer mortality endpoint has been difficult to study and is confounded by population heterogeneity, provision of randomization, and requirement of large cohorts with sufficiently long follow-up due to the excellent prognosis of the cancer. Accordingly, it may be important to reconsider how to best measure thyroid cancer screening efficacy. Recommendations against thyroid cancer screening should be based upon trials designed to evaluate its effectiveness not only in significant reduction in cancer mortality, but also of other distinct endpoint s. It is desirable to evaluate derivative endpoints that can reliably predict reductions in mortality. The term "derivative" means a variable that is related to the true endpoint and is likely to be observable before the primary endpoint. Derivative endpoints may include thyroid cancer incidence, the proportion of early-stage tumors detected, more treatable stage, the identification of small tumors (to maintain in observation), decrease in the number of people who develop metastatic disease, the increased chance of lesser extent surgery, and the application of minimally invasive approaches, as well as no need for lifelong thyroid replacement therapy, a consistent follow-up, low-dose or no RAI administration and risk factor assessments where case findings should be continuous. The Korean guidelines for thyroid cancer national-level screening were published by a relevant group of multidisciplinary thyroid experts. It was concluded that the evidence is insufficient to balance the benefits and harms of thyroid cancer screening. However, the paper seems to raise the necessary investments in future research and demand a complete analysis for derivative endpoints, and offer screening participants with complete information necessary to make decisions that will provide them with the most value when a small thyroid cancer is screen- identified.

28009049|t|Zebrafish adult pigment stem cells are multipotent and form pigment cells by a progressive fate restriction process: Clonal analysis identifies shared origin of all pigment cell types
28009049|a|Skin pigment pattern formation is a paradigmatic example of pattern formation. In zebrafish, the adult body stripes are generated by coordinated rearrangement of three distinct pigment cell-types, black melanocytes, shiny iridophores and yellow xanthophores. A stem cell origin of melanocytes and iridophores has been proposed although the potency of those stem cells has remained unclear. Xanthophores, however, seemed to originate predominantly from proliferation of embryonic xanthophores. Now, data from Singh et al. shows that all three cell-types derive from shared stem cells, and that these cells generate peripheral neural cell-types too. Furthermore, clonal compositions are best explained by a progressive fate restriction model generating the individual cell-types. The numbers of adult pigment stem cells associated with the dorsal root ganglia remain low, but progenitor numbers increase significantly during larval development up to metamorphosis, likely via production of partially restricted progenitors on the spinal nerves.

28010062|t|Covalent Modulators of the Vacuolar ATPase
28010062|a|The vacuolar H(+) ATPase (V-ATPase) is a complex multisubunit machine that regulates important cellular processes through controlling acidity of intracellular compartments in eukaryotes. Existing small-molecule modulators of V-ATPase either are restricted to targeting one membranous subunit of V-ATPase or have poorly understood mechanisms of action. Small molecules with novel and defined mechanisms of inhibition are thus needed to functionally characterize V-ATPase and to fully evaluate the therapeutic relevance of V-ATPase in human diseases. We have discovered electrophilic quinazolines that covalently modify a soluble catalytic subunit of V-ATPase with high potency and exquisite proteomic selectivity as revealed by fluorescence imaging and chemical proteomic activity-based profiling. The site of covalent modification was mapped to a cysteine residue located in a region of V-ATPase subunit A that is thought to regulate the dissociation of V-ATPase. We further demonstrate that a previously reported V-ATPase inhibitor, 3-bromopyruvate, also targets the same cysteine residue and that our electrophilic quinazolines modulate the function of V-ATPase in cells. With their well-defined mechanism of action and high proteomic specificity, the described quinazolines offer a powerful set of chemical probes to investigate the physiological and pathological roles of V-ATPase.

28011044|t|Association of Radiomics and Metabolic Tumor Volumes in Radiation Treatment of Glioblastoma Multiforme
28011044|a|To build a framework for investigation of the associations between imaging, clinical target volumes (CTVs), and metabolic tumor volumes (MTVs) features for better understanding of the underlying information in the CTVs and dependencies between these volumes. High-throughput extraction of imaging and metabolomic quantitative features from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) results in tens of variables per patient. In radiation therapy of GBM the relevant metabolic tumor volumes (MTVs) are related to aberrant levels of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) and choline (Cho). The corresponding clinical target volumes (CTVs) for radiation therapy are based on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (CE-T1w) and T2-weighted (T2w)/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI. Necrotic portions, enhancing lesion, and edema were manually contoured on CE-T1w / T2w images for 17 GBM patients. Clinical target volumes and MTVs for NAA (MTVNAA) and Cho (MTVCho) were constructed. Imaging and metabolic features related to size, shape, and signal intensities of the volumes were extracted. Tumors were also scored categorically for 10 semantic imaging traits by a neuroradiologist. All features were investigated for redundancy. Two-way correlations between imaging and CTVs / MTVs features were visualized as heatmaps. Associations between MTVNAA and MTVCho and imaging features were studied using Spearman correlation. Forty-eight imaging features were extracted per patient. Half of the imaging traits were replaced with automatically extracted continuous variables. Twenty features were extracted from CTVs and MTVs. A series of semantic imaging traits were replaced with automatically extracted continuous variables. There were multiple (22) significant correlations of imaging measures with CTVs / MTVNAA, whereas there were only 6 with CTVs / MTVCho. A framework for investigation of codependencies between MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging radiomic features and CTVs / MTVs has been established. The MTV for NAA was found to be closely associated with MRI volumes, whereas very few imaging features were related to MTVCho, indicating that Cho provides additional information to imaging.

28011408|t|Measurement of fidgeting in patients with anorexia nervosa using a novel shoe -based monitor
28011408|a|To objectively assess seated non-exercise physical activity in patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) relative to healthy controls (HCs) and examine the associations between this physical activity, eating disorder pathology, and levels of anxiety and depression. Eleven inpatients with AN and 10 HCs wore a shoe -based accelerometer (SmartShoe) at three time points: a) while eating lunch, b) filling out questionnaires, and c) watching television for 1h. Across all three tasks, patients with AN were significantly more active than HCs, thereby engaging in a greater degree of restless or fidgeting behavior. Degree of physical activity was positively correlated with eating disorder psychopathology in the sample with AN, and a trend towards a positive association between physical activity and levels of depression and anxiety was also found in this sample. Among individuals with AN, physical activity was not significantly correlated with BMI, duration of illness, or number of days since hospital admission. Use of a minimally invasive, shoe -based monitor revealed patients with AN engaged in a greater degree of fidgeting relative to HCs during quiet, seated tasks and this heightened activity was related to measures of pathology. Non-exercise physical activity, including fidgeting, may warrant further clinical attention in this patient population.

28013377|t|Hospital clowning: a paediatrician's view
28013377|a|This study investigates the current position of hospital clowns from the perspective of paediatricians and paediatric residents. A total of 14 attending paediatricians and paediatric residents participated in two focus group sessions. Data were analysed using Atlas.ti 5.0. In general, physicians reported positive experiences regarding the interaction between hospital clowns and paediatric patients on the ward. Physicians were more interested in research on children's perception of hospital clowns than in research on the clinical efficacy of hospital clowning. No direct collaboration between physicians and hospital clowns was reported. However, physicians proposed conditions which may streamline their encounters with hospital clowns such as clear communication prior to hospital clown visits, and the condition that visits do not impede medical interventions. Overall, paediatricians and paediatric residents view the positive impact on paediatric patients as the most important aspect of hospital clown visits, rather than the clinical efficacy of hospital clowning. In light of the growing number of hospital clowns worldwide, this article provides recommendations for arranging their encounters with paediatricians and paediatric residents to maintain optimal health care. What is known: • Previous studies show a clinically significant pain - and anxiety - reducing effect of hospital clowning in paediatric patients admitted to hospitals or undergoing (invasive) medical procedures. • In general, paediatricians have positive ideas about hospital clowns, aside from personal prejudices. What is new: • This novel study gives deeper insight into day-to-day interaction between paediatricians and hospital clowns on the ward. • This study provides recommendations for clinical practice to arrange encounters between physicians and hospital clowns during hospital clown visits.

28019021|t|Multiparametric estimation of brain hemodynamics with MR fingerprinting ASL
28019021|a|Assessment of brain hemodynamics without exogenous contrast agents is of increasing importance in clinical applications. This study aims to develop an MR perfusion technique that can provide noncontrast and multiparametric estimation of hemodynamic markers. We devised an arterial spin labeling (ASL) method based on the principle of MR fingerprinting (MRF), referred to as MRF-ASL. By taking advantage of the rich information contained in MRF sequence, up to seven hemodynamic parameters can be estimated concomitantly. Feasibility demonstration, flip angle optimization, comparison with Look-Locker ASL, reproducibility test, sensitivity to hypercapnia challenge, and initial clinical application in an intracranial steno-occlusive process, Moyamoya disease, were performed to evaluate this technique. Magnetic resonance fingerprinting ASL provided estimation of up to seven parameters, including B1+, tissue T1, cerebral blood flow (CBF), tissue bolus arrival time (BAT), pass-through arterial BAT, pass-through blood volume, and pass-through blood travel time. Coefficients of variation of the estimated parameters ranged from 0.2 to 9.6%. Hypercapnia resulted in an increase in CBF by 57.7%, and a decrease in BAT by 13.7 and 24.8% in tissue and vessels, respectively. Patients with Moyamoya disease showed diminished CBF and lengthened BAT that could not be detected with regular ASL. Magnetic resonance fingerprinting ASL is a promising technique for noncontrast, multiparametric perfusion assessment.

28019706|t|Acute sensitivity of the vernal pool fairy shrimp, Branchinecta lynchi (Anostraca; Branchinectidae), and surrogate species to 10 chemicals
28019706|a|Vernal pool fairy shrimp, Branchinecta lynchi, (Branchiopoda; Anostraca) and other fairy shrimp species have been listed as threatened or endangered under the US Endangered Species Act. Because few data exist about the sensitivity of Branchinecta spp. to toxic effects of contaminants, it is difficult to determine whether they are adequately protected by water quality criteria. A series of acute (24-h) lethality/immobilization tests was conducted with 3 species of fairy shrimp (B. lynchi, Branchinecta lindahli, and Thamnocephalus platyurus) and 10 chemicals with varying modes of toxic action: ammonia, potassium, chloride, sulfate, chromium(VI), copper, nickel, zinc, alachlor, and metolachlor. The same chemicals were tested in 48- h tests with other branchiopods (the cladocerans Daphnia magna and Ceriodaphnia dubia) and an amphipod (Hyalella azteca), and in 96- h tests with snails (Physa gyrina and Lymnaea stagnalis). Median effect concentrations (EC50s) for B. lynchi were strongly correlated (r(2) = 0.975) with EC50s for the commercially available fairy shrimp species T. platyurus for most chemicals tested. Comparison of EC50s for fairy shrimp and EC50s for invertebrate taxa tested concurrently and with other published toxicity data indicated that fairy shrimp were relatively sensitive to potassium and several trace metals compared with other invertebrate taxa, although cladocerans, amphipods, and mussels had similar broad toxicant sensitivity. Interspecies correlation estimation models for predicting toxicity to fairy shrimp from surrogate species indicated that models with cladocerans and freshwater mussels as surrogates produced the best predictions of the sensitivity of fairy shrimp to contaminants. The results of these studies indicate that fairy shrimp are relatively sensitive to a range of toxicants, but Endangered Species Act -listed fairy shrimp of the genus Branchinecta were not consistently more sensitive than other fairy shrimp taxa.

28024592|t|Bi-layered constructs of poly(glycerol-sebacate) - β-tricalcium phosphate for bone-soft tissue interface applications
28024592|a|This study aims to establish a facile protocol for the preparation of a bi-layered poly(glycerol-sebacate) (PGS)/ β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) construct and to investigate its potential for bone-soft tissue engineering applications. The layered structure was prepared by distributing the ceramic particles within a prepolymer synthesized in a microwave reactor followed by a cross-linking of the final construct in vacuum (<10mbar). The vacuum stage led to the separation of cross-linked elastomer (top) and ceramic (bottom) phases. Results showed that addition of β-TCP particles to the elastomer matrix after the polymerization led to an increase in compression strength (up to 14±2.3MPa). Tensile strength (σ), Young's modulus (E), and elongation at break (%) values were calculated as 0.29±0.03MPa and 0.21±0.03; 0.38±0.02 and 1.95±0.4; and 240±50% and 24±2% for PGS and PGS / β-TCP bi-layered constructs, respectively. Morphology was characterized by using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and micro-computed tomography (μ-CT). Tomography data revealed an open porosity of 35% for the construct, mostly contributed from the ceramic phase since the elastomer side has no pore. Homogeneous β-TCP distribution within the elastomeric structure was observed. Cell culture studies confirmed biocompatibility with poor elastomer - side and good bone - side cell attachment. In a further study to investigate the osteogenic properties, the construct were loaded with BMP-2 and/or TGF-β1. The PGS / β-TCP bi-layered constructs with improved mechanical and biological properties have the potential to be used in bone-soft tissue interface applications where soft tissue penetration is a problem.

28024987|t|Effects of high-intensity training on cardiovascular risk factors in premenopausal and postmenopausal women
28024987|a|Menopause is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and the causal factors have been proposed to be the loss of estrogen and the subsequent alterations of the hormonal milieu. However, which factors contribute to the deterioration of cardiometabolic health in postmenopausal women is debated as the menopausal transition is also associated with increased age and fat mass. Furthermore, indications of reduced cardiometabolic adaptations to exercise in postmenopausal women add to the adverse health profile. We sought to evaluate risk factors for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in late premenopausal and early postmenopausal women, matched by age and body composition, and investigate the effect of high-intensity training. A 3-month high-intensity aerobic training intervention, involving healthy, nonobese, late premenopausal (n = 40) and early postmenopausal (n = 39) women was conducted and anthropometrics, body composition, blood pressure, lipid profile, glucose tolerance, and maximal oxygen consumption were determined at baseline and after the intervention. At baseline, the groups matched in anthropometrics and body composition, and only differed by 4.2 years in age (mean [95% confidence limits] 49.2 [48.5-49.9] vs 53.4 [52.4-54.4] years). Time since last menstrual period for the postmenopausal women was (mean [95% confidecnce limits] 3.1 [2.6-3.7] years). Hormonal levels (estrogen, follicle stimulation hormone, luteinizing hormone) confirmed menopausal status. At baseline the postmenopausal women had higher total cholesterol (P < .001), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (P < .05), and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (P < .001) than the premenopausal women. The training intervention reduced body weight (P < .01), waist circumference (P < .01), and improved body composition by increasing lean body mass (P < .001) and decreasing fat mass (P < .001) similarly in both groups. Moreover, training resulted in lower diastolic blood pressure (P < .05), resting heart rate (P < .001), total cholesterol (P < .01), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (P < .01), total cholesterol / high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol index (P < .01), and improved plasma insulin concentration during the oral glucose tolerance test (P < .05) in both groups. Cardiovascular risk factors are similar in late premenopausal and early postmenopausal women, matched by age and body composition, with the exception that postmenopausal women have higher high- and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels. A 3-month intervention of high-intensity aerobic training reduces risk factors for type 2 .diabetes and cardiovascular disease to a similar extent in late premenopausal and early postmenopausal women.

28025023|t|Correlation between preoperative physical signs and functional outcomes after laminoplasty for ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament
28025023|a|Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) can cause myelopathy that is often managed surgically. Knowledge of predictors of surgical outcomes can provide decision support to surgeons. The aims of this study were to investigate the relationships between preoperative physical signs and postoperative functional outcomes in patients with OPLL and to clarify whether physical signs could predict functional outcomes. Fifty-five patients with OPLL who had undergone cervical laminoplasty were included in this study. Six physical signs including hyperreflexia, Babinski sign, sensory disturbance, grip strength, 10-s grip and release test, and bladder dysfunction, and four other factors including age, duration of symptoms, history of minor trauma and preoperative Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score were investigated as potential predictive prognostic factors using both univariate and multivariate analyses. The mean recovery rate of JOA score was 62.5 ± 32.5%. The neurological recovery rate was negatively associated with age (P = 0.002), the duration of symptoms (P = 0.002) and Babinski sign (P = 0.007), whereas it was positively correlated with grip strength (P = 0.011). Multiple logistic regression analyses revealed that age (Odds ratio: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.81-0.99) and Babinski sign (Odds ratio: 0.18, 95% CI: 0.04-0.89) were factors associated with functional outcomes. Satisfactory functional outcomes could be expected for patients who are young and do not exhibit the Babinski sign, showing that the Babinski sign could be useful as an indicator of the window of opportunity for achieving satisfactory functional outcomes.

28025224|t|Bacteria and Hoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae) in Tree Hollows From the Iberian Mediterranean Forest
28025224|a|Saproxylic insect communities inhabiting tree hollows in Mediterranean forests depend on a combination of physical characteristics and interactions occurring between community member species. Despite the need to preserve these organisms, little is known about their interrelationships, in particular those relationships between saproxylic insects and microbiota occurring in these microhabitats. In tree hollows of Quercus rotundifolia Lamark that hold water and contain dead leaves, abundant microbial populations can be found. Developing on them are the larvae of Mallota dusmeti Andréu, 1926 (Diptera: Syrphidae), a vulnerable species (IUCN category: Marcos-García and Quinto 2011). This study provides the first data on the microbiota living inside the gut of the larvae of M. dusmeti, as well as the microbiota in the hollow where these larvae develop. Bacteria were identified by amplification and partial sequencing of the V1-V3 regions and the complete nucleotide sequence of 16S rRNA genes. We found eight species of bacteria living in tree hollows and three species in the gut of M. dusmeti larvae: Bacillus cereus, Bacillus toyonensis, and Lysinibacillus sphaericus The filter-feeding mechanism characteristic of M. dusmeti larvae is selective in enabling ingestion of bacteria only above 2.1 µm in diameter.

28026207|t|Impact sports and bone fractures among adolescents
28026207|a|The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of different sports on stress fractures among adolescents during a 9- month follow-up period. The sample was composed of 184 adolescents divided into three groups (impact sports [n = 102]; swimming [n = 35]; non-sports [n = 47]). The occurrence of stress fracture was reported by participants and coaches. As potential confounders we considered age, sex, resistance training, body composition variables and age at peak of height velocity. There were 13 adolescents who reported fractures during the 9- month period. Bone mineral density values were higher in adolescents engaged in impact sports (P-value = 0.002). Independently of confounders, the risk of stress fracture was lower in adolescents engaged in impact sports than in non-active adolescents (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.23 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.05 to 0.98]), while swimming practice was not associated to lower risk of fracture (HR = 0.49 [95% CI = 0.09 to 2.55]). In conclusion, the findings from this study indicate the importance of sports participation among adolescents in the reduction of stress fracture risk, especially with impact sports. More importantly, these results could be relevant for recognising adolescents in danger of not reaching their potential for peak bone mass and later an increased risk of fractures.

28027163|t|The Business of Health Physics - Jobs In A Changing Market
28027163|a|The health physics profession was born abruptly when once rare and precious radioactive materials became commonplace. The technological advancements that triggered an industrial complex and ended World War II demanded radiation safety on an unprecedented scale. Until then, protective measures against radiation were largely absent in laboratories. Over the subsequent decades, health physicists began protecting people and the environment in a wide range of settings including medical, research, and industrial. The use of radioactive materials and radiation-generating devices is prevalent today. Radiation doses occur continuously including during airline flights, in our homes, during medical procedures, and in energy production. Radiation is integral to numerous applications including those in medicine, dentistry, manufacturing, construction, scientific research, nuclear electric power generation, and oil and gas exploration. Activities that were once groundbreaking have now become routine and scripted. At higher doses, health effects are understood and avoided. Instruments for the detection and measurement of radiation are at times smarter than their users. Ironically, the same health physics community that has been successful in demonstrating that exposures to radiation and to radioactive materials can be effectively managed is shrinking at an increasingly rapid rate. This paper highlights the creation of past and current jobs, predicts the future opportunities in the profession, and makes recommendations necessary to protect the disappearing specialties.

28032366|t|Permanence can be Defended
28032366|a|In donation after the circulatory-respiratory determination of death (DCDD), the dead donor rule requires that the donor be dead before organ procurement can proceed. Under the relevant limb of the Uniform Determination of Death Act 1981 (USA), a person is dead when the cessation of circulatory-respiratory function is ' irreversible '. Critics of current practice in DCDD have argued that the donor is not dead at the time organs are procured, and so the procurement of organs from these donors violates the dead donor rule. We offer a new argument here in defence of current DCDD practice, and, in particular, of the interpretation of the requirement of ' irreversibility ' as permanence.

28033725|t|Untypeable hepatitis C virus subtypes in Pakistan: A neglected section
28033725|a|Diagnostically untypeable subtypes contribute a considerable percent of hepatitis C virus (HCV) subtypes in Pakistan. In the present study, chronically infected HCV patients with known viremia were subjected to HCV genotyping. Among the total retrieved samples, 92.7% (64/69) were found typeable while 7.24% (5/69) were diagnostically untypeable. In conclusion, the presence of large number of untypeable HCV subtypes emphasizes the need of an updated type - specific genotyping assay and consideration of primers for proportionally rare subtypes to minimize the number of untypeable HCV subtypes.

28036301|t|ITPR3 gene haplotype is associated with cervical squamous cell carcinoma risk in Taiwanese women
28036301|a|Host immunogenetic background plays an important role in human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and cervical cancer development. Inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor type 3 (ITPR3) is essential for both immune activation and cancer pathogenesis. We aim to investigate if ITPR3 genetic polymorphisms are associated with the risk of cervical cancer in Taiwanese women. ITPR3 rs3748079 A/G and rs2229634 C/T polymorphisms were genotyped in a hospital-based study of 462 women with cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) and 921 age-matched healthy control women. The presence and genotypes of HPV in CSCC was determined. No significant association of individual ITPR3 variants were found among controls, CSCC, and HPV-16 positive CSCC. However, we found a significant association of haplotype AT between CSCC and controls (OR = 2.28, 95% CI 1.31-3.97, P = 2.83 × 10-3) and the OR increased further in CSCC patients infected with HPV-16 (OR = 2.89, 95% CI 1.55-5.37, P = 4.54 × 10-4). The linkage disequilibrium analysis demonstrated that ITPR3 association with CSCC was independent of HLA-DRB1 alleles. In conclusion, these findings suggest that AT haplotype in the ITPR3 gene may serve as a potential marker for genetic susceptibility to CSCC.

28039284|t|Defining categories of actionability for secondary findings in next-generation sequencing
28039284|a|Next-generation sequencing is increasingly used in clinical practice for the diagnosis of Mendelian diseases. Because of the high likelihood of secondary findings associated with this technique, the process of informing patients is beset with new challenges. One of them is regarding the type of secondary findings that ought to be disclosed to patients. The aim of this research is to propose a practical implementation of the notion of actionability, a common criteria justifying the disclosure of secondary findings but whose interpretation varies greatly among professionals. We distinguish three types of actionability corresponding to (1) well-established medical actions, (2) patient -initiated health-related actions and (3) life-plan decisions. We argue that actionability depends on the characteristics of the mutation or gene and on the values of patients. In discussing the return of secondary findings, it is important that the physician tries to get an impression of the specific situation and values of patients. Regarding variants of uncertain clinical significance in actionable genes, we found that different understandings of autonomy lead to different conclusions and that, for some of them, it may be legitimate to refrain from returning uncertain information.

28039304|t|Allergen Valency, Dose, and FcεRI Occupancy Set Thresholds for Secretory Responses to Pen a 1 and Motivate Design of Hypoallergens
28039304|a|Ag -mediated crosslinking of IgE - FcεRI complexes activates mast cells and basophils, initiating the allergic response. Of 34 donors recruited having self-reported shrimp allergy, only 35% had significant levels of shrimp-specific IgE in serum and measurable basophil secretory responses to rPen a 1 (shrimp tropomyosin). We report that degranulation is linked to the number of FcεRI occupied with allergen-specific IgE, as well as the dose and valency of Pen a 1. Using clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeat-based gene editing, human RBL(rαKO) cells were created that exclusively express the human FcεRIα subunit. Pen a 1 - specific IgE was affinity purified from shrimp - positive plasma. Cells primed with a range of Pen a 1 - specific IgE and challenged with Pen a 1 showed a bell-shaped dose response for secretion, with optimal Pen a 1 doses of 0.1-10 ng/ml. Mathematical modeling provided estimates of receptor aggregation kinetics based on FcεRI occupancy with IgE and allergen dose. Maximal degranulation was elicited when ∼2700 I gE - FcεRI complexes were occupied with specific IgE and challenged with Pen a 1 (IgE epitope valency of ≥8), although measurable responses were achieved when only a few hundred FcεRI were occupied. Prolonged periods of pepsin -mediated Pen a 1 proteolysis, which simulates gastric digestion, were required to diminish secretory responses. Recombinant fragments (60-79 aa), which together span the entire length of tropomyosin, were weak secretagogues. These fragments have reduced dimerization capacity, compete with intact Pen a 1 for binding to IgE - FcεRI complexes, and represent a starting point for the design of promising hypoallergens for immunotherapy.

28043654|t|Selected flavonoid compounds as promising inhibitors of protein kinase CK2α and CK2α', the catalytic subunits of CK2
28043654|a|CK2 is a ubiquitous protein kinase involved in many cell functions. During the last years it became an interesting target in cancer research. A series of flavonoid compounds was tested as inhibitors of protein kinase CK2. Several substances were found to be highly active against both catalytic subunits with IC50 values below 1 μM in case of CK2α'. The most promising inhibitor we identified is chrysoeriol with IC50 values of 250 and 34 nM for CK2α and CK2α', respectively.

28044140|t|Fibrinogen: A Marker in Predicting Diabetic Foot Ulcer Severity
28044140|a|Aims. To examine whether fibrinogen levels are a valuable biomarker for assessing disease severity and monitoring disease progression in patients with diabetic foot ulcer (DFU). Methods. A retrospective study was designed to examine the utility of fibrinogen in estimating disease severity in patients with DFU admitted to our hospital between January 2015 and January 2016. In total, 152 patients with DFU were enrolled in the study group, and 52 age and gender matched people with diabetes but no DFU were included as the control group. DFU severity was assessed using Wagner criteria. Results. Patients with DFU were divided into 2 subgroups based on the Wagner criteria. Mean fibrinogen values were significantly higher in patients with DFU grade ≧ 3 compared to those with DFU grades 1-2 (5.23 ± 1.37 g/L versus 3.61 ± 1.04 g/L). Using ROC statistic, a cut-off value of 5.13 g/L indicated the possible amputation with a sensitivity of 81.8% and a specificity of 78.9% (positive predictive value [PPV] 78.6%, negative predictive value [89.0%]). Fibrinogen values were found to be correlated with CRP levels, neutrophil, and WBC count. Conclusions. Fibrinogen levels might be a valuable tool for assessing the disease severity and monitoring the disease progression in patients with DFU.

28046142|t|Nitrogen utilization efficiency and prediction of nitrogen excretion in sheep offered fresh perennial ryegrass ()
28046142|a|Nitrogen excretion from sheep production systems is an important source of nitrate, ammonia, and nitrous oxide responsible for groundwater pollution and global warming. The present study aimed to identify key parameters influencing N utilization efficiency and develop prediction equations for manure N, feces N, and urine N outputs in sheep. Data used were collected from 82 sheep offered fresh perennial ryegrass () as the sole diet in 6 metabolism experiments (data from non-grass-only diets were not used). Sheep were from breeds of Highlander, Texel, Scottish Blackface, and Swaledale at the age of 5 to 18 mo and weighing from 24.5 to 62.7 kg. Herbage was harvested daily from 6 swards of contrasting harvest dates (May to December), offering wide variation in feed value to cover the range that would be offered in most practical farm situations. Before the commencement of each study, the experimental sward was harvested at a residual height of 4 cm and allowed to grow for 2 to 4 wk to target an average pregrazing sward height in a range of 8 to 15 cm depending on the time of year. Sheep were housed in individual pens for 14 d and then transferred to individual metabolism crates for 4 d with feed intake and feces and urine outputs measured. Data were analyzed using the linear mixed model procedure to develop prediction equations for feces N, urine N, and manure N outputs using N intake, herbage chemical composition, and digestibility with effects of sex, breed, and experimental periods removed. Nitrogen intake was the best single predictor for N output in feces, urine, and manure, and the value for prediction of manure N output was greater than those for feces N and urine N (0.86 vs. 0.70 and 0.77, respectively; < 0.001). Animal BW and herbage DM, ether extract, NDF, ADF, water soluble carbohydrate, and DE concentrations and N digestibility were also used to predict N outputs because N intake may not be available in commercial practice. The prediction equations for N utilizatio n efficiency indicated that increasing feeding level and ME concentration and reducing N concentration could improve N utilization efficiency and shift N excretion into feces rather than urine (< 0.001). The equations developed in the current study provide an approach for sheep producers to quantify N excretion against production and, consequently, to develop their own mitigation strategies to reduce the environmental impact of sheep production systems.

28049415|t|Improving protein complex prediction by reconstructing a high-confidence protein-protein interaction network of Escherichia coli from different physical interaction data sources
28049415|a|Although different protein-protein physical interaction (PPI) datasets exist for Escherichia coli, no common methodology exists to integrate these datasets and extract reliable modules reflecting the existing biological process and protein complexes. Naïve Bayesian formula is the highly accepted method to integrate different PPI datasets into a single weighted PPI network, but detecting proper weights in such network is still a major problem. In this paper, we proposed a new methodology to integrate various physical PPI datasets into a single weighted PPI network in a way that the detected modules in PPI network exhibit the highest similarity to available functional modules. We used the co-expression modules as functional modules, and we shown that direct functional modules detected from Gene Ontology terms could be used as an alternative dataset. After running this integrating methodology over six different physical PPI datasets, orthologous high-confidence interactions from a related organism and two AP-MS PPI datasets gained high weights in the integrated networks, while the weights for one AP-MS PPI dataset and two other datasets derived from public databases have converged to zero. The majority of detected modules shaped around one or few hub protein(s). Still, a large number of highly interacting protein modules were detected which are functionally relevant and are likely to construct protein complexes. We provided a new high confidence protein complex prediction method supported by functional studies and literature mining.

28053186|t|AAV9 - NPC1 significantly ameliorates Purkinje cell death and behavioral abnormalities in mouse NPC disease
28053186|a|Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease is a fatal inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in the NPC1 or NPC2 gene. There is no effective way to treat NPC disease. In this study, we used adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype 9 (AAV9) to deliver a functional NPC1 gene systemically into NPC1(-/-) mice at postnatal day 4. One single AAV9-NPC1 injection resulted in robust NPC1 expression in various tissues, including brain, heart, and lung. Strikingly, AAV9-mediated NPC1 delivery significantly promoted Purkinje cell survival, restored locomotor activity and coordination, and increased the lifespan of NPC1(-/-) mice. Our work suggests that AAV-based gene therapy is a promising means to treat NPC disease.

28055142|t|Executive functions deficits impair extinction of generalization of fear of movement-related pain
28055142|a|Generalization of fear of movement-related pain across novel but similar movements can lead to fear responses to movements that are actually not associated with pain. The peak-shift effect describes a phenomenon whereby particular novel movements elicit even greater fear responses than the original pain-provoking movement (CS+), because they represent a more extreme version of the CS+. There is great variance in the propensity to generalize as well as the speed of extinction learning when these novel movements are not followed by pain. It can be argued that this variance may be associated with executive function capacity, as individuals may be unable to intentionally inhibit fear responses. This study examined whether executive function capacity contributes to generalization and extinction of generalization as well as peak-shift of conditioned fear of movement-related pain and expectancy. Healthy participants performed a proprioceptive fear conditioning task. Executive function tests assessing updating, switching, and inhibition were used to predict changes in (extinction of) fear of movement-related pain and pain expectancy generalization. Low inhibitory capacity was associated with slower extinction of generalized fear of movement-related pain and pain expectancy. Evidence was found in favor of an area-shift, rather than a peak-shift effect, which implies that the peak conditioned fear response extended to, but did not shift to a novel stimulus. Participants with low inhibitory capacity may have difficulties withholding fear responses, leading to a slower decrease of generalized fear over time. The findings may be relevant to inform treatments. Low inhibitory capacity is not associated with slower generalization, but extinction of fear generalization. Fear elicited by a novel safe movement, situated outside the CS+/- continuum on the CS+ side, can be as strong as to the original stimulus predicting the pain-onset.

28055920|t|Robust DLPP With Nongreedy ℓ₁$-Norm Minimization and Maximization
28055920|a|Recently, discriminant locality preserving projection based on L1-norm (DLPP-L1) was developed for robust subspace learning and image classification. It obtains projection vectors by greedy strategy, i.e., all projection vectors are optimized individually through maximizing the objective function. Thus, the obtained solution does not necessarily best optimize the corresponding trace ratio optimization algorithm, which is the essential objective function for general dimensionality reduction. It results in insufficient recognition accuracy. To tackle this problem, we propose a nongreedy algorithm to solve the trace ratio formula of DLPP-L1, and analyze its convergence. Experimental results on three databases illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.

28056024|t|A Double-Blind Randomized Controlled Trial of Maternal Postpartum Deworming to Improve Infant Weight Gain in the Peruvian Amazon
28056024|a|Nutritional interventions targeting the critical growth and development period before two years of age can have the greatest impact on health trajectories over the life course. Compelling evidence has demonstrated that interventions investing in maternal health in the first 1000 days of life are beneficial for both mothers and their children. One such potential intervention is deworming integrated into maternal postpartum care in areas where soil - transmitted helminth (STH) infections are endemic. From February to August 2014, 1010 mother - infant pairs were recruited into a trial aimed at assessing the effectiveness of maternal postpartum deworming on infant and maternal health outcomes. Following delivery, mothers were randomly assigned to receive either single- dose 400 mg albendazole or placebo. Participants were followed-up at 1 and 6 months postpartum. There was no statistically significant difference in mean weight gain between infants in the experimental and control groups (mean difference: -0.02; 95% CI: -0.1, 0.08) at 6 months of age. Further, deworming had no effect on measured infant morbidity indicators. However, ad hoc analyses restricted to mothers who tested positive for STHs at baseline suggest that infants of mothers in the experimental group had greater mean length gain in cm (mean difference: 0.8; 95% CI: 0.1, 1.4) and length-for-age z-score (mean difference: 0.5; 95% CI: 0.2, 0.8) at 6 months of age. In a study population composed of both STH-infected and uninfected mothers, maternal postpartum deworming was insufficient to impact infant growth and morbidity indicators up to 6 months postpartum. Among STH-infected mothers, however, important improvements in infant length gain and length-for-age were observed. The benefits of maternal postpartum deworming should be further investigated in study populations having higher overall prevalences and intensities of STH infections and, in particular, where whipworm and hookworm infections are of public health concern.

28056376|t|Technical note: A preliminary comparative study between classical and interventional radiological approaches for multi-phase post-mortem CT angiography
28056376|a|Multi-phase post-mortem computed tomography angiography (MPMCTA) is a new diagnostic tool, used in forensic pathology. On the one hand, this technique allows a better and direct visualization of vascular and solid organ lesions. On the other hand, the invasiveness of the procedure -which requires surgical denudation (inguinal and/or cervical) and the insertion of surgical cannulas -leads to many relatives refusing scientific autopsies. Our hypothesis states that a minimally-invasive procedure combining interventional radiological techniques with MPMCTA (replacement of surgical cannulas by radiological catheters) will improve the approval rate of scientific autopsies by families. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of the minimally-invasive MPMCTA approach and to compare its performance to the current reference-standard (the conventional approach). We included consecutively 16 corpses divided in two groups according to the contrast enhancement approach: radiological catheters (n=8), and surgical cannulas (n=8). Corpses were chosen and assigned randomly from our local data. The quality of the imaging procedure was compared according to four items: global vascular opacification, cerebral venous opacification, and lower limbs opacification (arterial and venous). A minimally-invasive approach for scientific autopsies is feasible through a radiological catheter. Vascular opacification was optimal in 8 out of 8 cases and was no less effective than the control reference group using surgical cannula incision associated with their non-occlusive aspects.

28056892|t|Correlations between physical activity and neurocognitive domain functions in patients with schizophrenia: a cross-sectional study
28056892|a|Neurocognitive dysfunction is a critical target symptom of schizophrenia treatment. A positive correlation between physical activity level and neurocognitive function has been reported in healthy individuals, but it is unclear whether such a correlation exists in patients with schizophrenia and whether the relationship is different according to inpatients or outpatients. This study aimed to examine the differences in the correlations between physical activity and multiple neurocognitive domains in inpatients and outpatients with schizophrenia and obtain suggestions for further study to facilitate this field. Twenty-nine patients with schizophrenia were examined (16 inpatients and 13 outpatients, 56.0 ± 11.4 years of age). Current symptoms were assessed using the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale and neurocognitive functions using Cognitrax, which yields a composite neurocognitive index (NCI) and 11 domain scores. After testing, participants wore an HJA-750C accelerometer for one week to measure physical activity levels and durations. Partial correlation analyses were performed between exercise and cognitive parameters. In the outpatient group, higher physical activity was associated with faster Motor and Psychomotor Speeds in outpatients. However, higher physical activity was associated with lower overall NCI, Attention score, and Memory scores in inpatients. Although higher physical activity was associated with better neurocognitive functions of outpatients, in inpatients with non-remitted schizophrenia, higher physical activity was associated with worsening of several cognitive domains. In a future study examining the relationship between physical activity and neurocognitive function for facilitating this research field, separation between inpatients and outpatients are needed because the relationship is different between inpatients and outpatients.

28058375|t|A rare cause of gastric obstruction: Lighters swallowing
28058375|a|The majority of swallowed foreign bodies are thrown spontaneously without causing complications in the digestive system. Multiple number of foreign bodies may be swallowed by psychiatric patients which delay diagnosis and increase the complication rate. Long and hard objects cannot pass through the pylorus, and may cause obstruction, ulceration, bleeding and perforation. Endoscopy is used as an effective method in such cases. An exploratory laparatomy was performed after unsuccessful endoscopic foreign object removal in a 28-year-old schizophrenic patient with gastric outlet obstruction due to multiple cigarette lighter swallowing. Ten lighters were removed from the stomach through gastrotomy and one more lighter was removed from the descending colon by milking through the anus. The aim of this paper is to discuss encountered difficulties in psychiatric patients who underwent surgery due to intake of foreign bodies.

28058593|t|Ceftaroline fosamil for community-acquired pneumonia and skin and skin structure infections: a systematic review
28058593|a|Background Ceftaroline is a parentally administered cephalosporin that has an in vitro expanded spectrum of activity compared with other cephalosporins yet data is conflicting regarding its place in therapy. Aim of the Review To compare the efficacy and safety of ceftaroline against standard antibiotic regimens for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSIs). Method The databases of MEDLINE, EBSCO, and Embase were searched up to June 2016. Manual review of references was completed and experts in the field were contacted for unpublished data. Randomized controlled trials of ceftaroline in CAP or cSSSI populations were included. Outcomes included clinical cure, mortality, adverse events, serious adverse events, and discontinuation due to adverse events. Meta-analysis was used to pool results for these outcomes. We performed subgroup analyses for gram positive infections in CAP and infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in cSSSIs. Risk of bias was assessed for all studies. Results Six trials (three for each indication) were included, each of which had an unclear or high risk of bias in at least one domain. For CAP, ceftaroline was significantly more efficacious in achieving clinical cure than ceftriaxone [risk ratio (RR) 1.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-1.19; I(2) = 47%]. For cSSSIs, there was no significant difference in clinical cure between ceftaroline and vancomycin plus aztreonam (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.97-1.05; I(2) = 0%). No differences were found for overall mortality, serious adverse events, discontinuation due to adverse events, and overall adverse events. Conclusion Ceftaroline is a viable therapeutic alternative for patients with CAP and cSSSIs, yet identified risks of bias and poor external validity preclude it from being recommended as a first-line agent.

28062192|t|Direct effects of glucose, insulin, GLP-1, and GIP on bulbospinal neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla in neonatal wistar rats
28062192|a|Although patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) often exhibit hypertension, the mechanisms responsible for this correlation are not well known. We hypothesized that the bulbospinal neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) are affected by the levels of glucose, insulin, or incretins (glucagon like peptide-1 [GLP-1] or glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide [GIP]) in patients with DM. To investigate whether RVLM neurons are activated by glucose, insulin, GLP-1, or GIP, we examined changes in the membrane potentials of bulbospinal RVLM neurons using whole-cell patch-clamp technique during superfusion with various levels of glucose or these hormones in neonatal Wistar rats. A brainstem - spinal cord preparation was used for the experiments. A low level of glucose stimulated bulbospinal RVLM neurons. During insulin superfusion, almost all the RVLM neurons were depolarized, while during GLP-1 or GIP superfusion, almost all the RVLM neurons were hyperpolarized. Next, histological examinations were performed to examine transporters for glucose and receptors for insulin, GLP-1, and GIP on RVLM neurons. Low - level glucose - depolarized RVLM neurons exhibited the presence of glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3). Meanwhile, insulin - depolarized, GLP-1 - hyperpolarized, and GIP - hyperpolarized RVLM neurons showed each of the respective specific receptor. These results indicate that a low level of glucose stimulates bulbospinal RVLM neurons via specific transporters on these neurons, inducing hypertension. Furthermore, an increase in insulin or a reduction in incretins may also activate the sympathetic nervous system and induce hypertension by activating RVLM neurons via their own receptors.

28063273|t|Mechanisms of compensation in the gait of patients with drop foot
28063273|a|Drop foot is a complex syndrome, with multiple interactions between joints and muscles. Abnormalities in movement patterns can be measured using motion capture techniques, but identifying compensation mechanisms remains challenging. In order to identify compensatory mechanisms in patients with drop foot, this study evaluated a sample of 15 such patients using a computerized gait analysis system, as compared to a group of 15 healthy subjects. Four classes of parameters were distinguished, falling in differing intervals of percentage differences between the groups in the study. The first class comprised two kinematic parameters for which the values of percentage differences in the control group were more than 100% greater than for the patient group. The second class comprised two kinetic parameters falling in the interval of 100-49%. In the third class, in the 49-20% interval the main differences were observed for spatiotemporal parameters, whereas in the 20-4% interval the differences were distributed similarly for kinematic, kinetic and spatiotemporal parameters. These differences in gait pattern between the groups may be related to both primary motor deficits and secondary compensatory mechanisms. Generally, we conclude that drop foot affects the patients ' overall kinematic and kinetic gait parameters, with compensation seen as a chain originating from a change of movement within the ankle joint.

28063305|t|Inhibitory effects of Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus casei on Candida biofilm of denture surface
28063305|a|Candida albicans biofilm is associated with denture-related stomatitis and oral candidiasis of elderly. Probiotics are beneficial bacteria and have antibacterial activity against pathogenic bacteria. The purpose of this study was to investigate the antifungal activity of various probiotics against C. albicans and the inhibitory effects of probiotics on Candida biofilm on the denture surface. The spent culture media of various probiotics were investigated the antifungal efficacy against C. albicans. Candida biofilm was formed on a denture base resin and was then treated with Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus casei. Also, the biofilm s of L. rhamnosus and L. casei were formed and were sequentially treated with C. albicans. Colony-forming units of C. albicans on the denture surface were counted after spreading on agar plate. The denture base resin was treated with the spent culture media for 30 days, after which the denture surface roughness was analyzed with an atomic force microscope. L. rhamnosus and L. casei exhibited stronger antifungal activity than other probiotics. The spent culture medium of L. rhamnosus and L. casei exhibited the antifungal activity against blastoconidia and biofilm of C. albicans. L. rhamnosus and L. casei showed the antifungal activity against Candida biofilm, and the biofilm of L. rhamnosus and L. casei inhibited formation of Candida biofilm on denture surface. Neither of the probiotics affected the surface roughness of the denture base resin. L. rhamnosus and L. casei may be the ideal probiotics for the prevention and treatment of denture-related stomatitis.

28063657|t|Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) in the atmosphere of three Chilean cities using passive air samplers
28063657|a|In this study passive air samplers containing polyurethane foam (PUF) disks were deployed in three cities across Chile; Santiago (STG) (n=5, sampling sites), Concepciόn (CON) (n=6) and Temuco (TEM) (n=6) from 2008 to 2009. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (7 indicator congeners), chlorinated pesticides hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethanes (DDTs) and flame retardants such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were determined by gas chromatography coupled mass spectrometry (GC/MS). A sampling rate (R) typical of urban sites (4m(3)/day) was used to estimate the atmospheric concentrations of individual compounds. PCB concentrations in the air (pg/m(3)) ranged from ~1-10 (TEM), ~1-40 (STG) and 4-30 (CON). Higher molecular weight PCBs (PCB -153, -180) were detected at industrial sites (in Concepción). The HCHs showed a prevalence of γ-HCH across all sites, indicative of inputs from the use of lindane but a limited use of technical HCHs in Chile. DDTs were detected with a prevalence of p,p'-DDE accounting for ~50% of the total DDTs. PBDE concentrations in air (pg/m(3)) ranged from 1 to 55 (STG), 0.5 to 20 (CON) and from 0.4 to 10 (TEM), and were generally similar to those reported for many other urban areas globally. The pattern of PBDEs was different among the three cities; however, PBDE -209 was dominant at most of the sites. These results represent one of the few assessments of air concentrations of POPs across different urban areas within the same country. These data will support Chilean commitments as a signatory to the Stockholm Convention on POPs and for reporting as a member country of the Group of Latin America and Caribbean Countries (GRULAC) region.

28067693|t|Intraoperative ketamine reduces immediate postoperative opioid consumption after spinal fusion surgery in chronic pain patients with opioid dependency: a randomized, blinded trial
28067693|a|Perioperative handling of surgical patients with opioid dependency represents an important clinical problem. Animal studies suggest that ketamine attenuates central sensitization and hyperalgesia and thereby reduces postoperative opioid tolerance. We hypothesized that intraoperative ketamine would reduce immediate postoperative opioid consumption compared with placebo in chronic pain patients with opioid dependency undergoing lumbar spinal fusion surgery. Primary outcome was morphine consumption 0 to 24 hours postoperatively. Secondary outcomes were acute pain at rest and during mobilization 2 to 24 hours postoperatively (visual analogue scale), adverse events, and persistent pain 6 months postoperatively. One hundred fifty patients were randomly assigned to intraoperative S-ketamine bolus 0.5 mg/kg and infusion 0.25 mg·kg·h or placebo. Postoperatively, patients received their usual opioids, paracetamol and IV patient-controlled analgesia with morphine. In the final analyses, 147 patients were included. Patient-controlled analgesia IV morphine consumption 0 to 24 hours postoperatively was significantly reduced in the ketamine group compared with the placebo group: 79 (47) vs 121 (53) mg IV, mean difference 42 mg (95% confidence interval -59 to -25), P < 0.001. Sedation was significantly reduced in the ketamine group 6 and 24 hours postoperatively. There were no significant differences regarding acute pain, nausea, vomiting, hallucinations, or nightmares. Back pain at 6 months postoperatively compared with preoperative pain was significantly more improved in the ketamine group compared with the placebo group, P = 0.005. In conclusion, intraoperative ketamine significantly reduced morphine consumption 0 to 24 hours after lumbar fusion surgery in opioid - dependent patients. The trend regarding less persistent pain 6 months postoperatively needs further investigation.

28068639|t|Effects of argan oil on the mitochondrial function, antioxidant system and the activity of NADPH - generating enzymes in acrylamide treated rat brain
28068639|a|Argan oil (AO) is rich in minor compounds such as polyphenols and tocopherols which are powerful antioxidants. Acrylamide (ACR) has been classified as a neurotoxic agent in animals and humans. Mitochondrial oxidative stress and dysfunction is one of the most probable molecular mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases. Female Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to ACR (50mg/kg i.p. three times a week), AO (6ml/kg,o.p, per day) or together for 30days. The activities of cytosolic enzymes such as xanthine oxidase (XO), glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), mitochondrial oxidative stress, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) enzymes, mitochondrial metabolic function, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) level and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity were assessed in rat brain. Cytosolic and mitochondrial antioxidant enzymes were significantly diminished in the brains of rats treated with ACR compared to those in control. Besides, ACR treatment resulted in a significant reduction in brain ATP level, mitochondrial metabolic function, OXPHOS and TCA enzymes. Administration of AO restored both the cytosolic and mitochondrial oxidative stress by normalizing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) generating enzymes. In addition, improved mitochondrial function primarily enhancing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) generated enzymes activities and ATP level in the mitochondria. The reason for AO's obvious beneficial effects in this study may be due to synergistic effects of its different bioactive compounds which is especially effective on mitochondria. Modulation of the brain mitochondrial functions and antioxidant systems by AO may lead to the development of new mitochondria - targeted antioxidants in the future.

28070811|t|Encaged Chironomus riparius larvae in assessment of trace metal bioavailability and transfer in a landfill leachate collection pond
28070811|a|Household wastes may constitute a vector of environmental contamination when buried, in particular through degradation and production of leachates containing significant trace metal (TM) concentrations that may constitute a serious risk to biota. The objectives of this study were to assess the bioavailability and transfer potential of various TMs present in water and sediments in a reservoir receiving landfill leachates. An active biomonitoring approach was adopted consisting of exposing naive laboratory organisms in cages deployed in the field. Aquatic insects such as Chironomus riparius larvae are good candidates since they represent key organisms in the trophic functioning of aquatic ecosystems. The results show that water, suspended particles, and sediments were significant ly contaminated by various TMs (As, Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn). Their contribution to the transfer of TMs depends, however, on the specific element considered, e.g., Cd in sediments or Pb in both suspended particles and sediments. The internal fate of TMs was investigated according to their fractionation between an insoluble and a cytosolic fraction. This approach revealed different detoxification strategies capable of preventing the induction of deleterious effects at the individual scale. However, the accumulation of several TMs in C. riparius larvae tissues may also represent a significant load potentially transferable to higher trophic levels.

28072457|t|Effects of Binge-Like Ethanol Exposure During Adolescence on the Febrile Response in Rats
28072457|a|Ethanol (EtOH) exposure during different phases of life may increase the risk of infections and cause alterations in the central nervous system. The present study investigated the effects of binge-like EtOH exposure in adolescent rats on the febrile response that was induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β). Male rats were exposed to EtOH from postnatal days 25 to 38 in a binge-like pattern. Fever was induced by LPS (5 and 50 μg/kg, intraperitoneally) and evaluated on postnatal days 51 and 63, or by IL-β (3 ng) and evaluated on postnatal day 51. Hematological parameters, the status of peritoneal macrophages, and plasma and cerebrospinal IL-1β levels were also evaluated on postnatal day 51. EtOH exposure during adolescence did not alter normal body temperature. However, a significant reduction in the febrile response that was induced by LPS at both doses was observed on postnatal day 51. However, no changes in the febrile response were observed on postnatal day 63 in EtOH-exposed animals. The febrile response that was induced by intracerebroventricular IL-1β also significantly decreased in animals that received binge-like EtOH exposure during adolescence. Acute oral treatment with EtOH 24 h prior to LPS administration did not alter the febrile response that was induced by LPS. Binge-like EtOH exposure during adolescence did not alter hematological parameters or the number or viability of peritoneal macrophages. Binge-like EtOH exposure did not alter plasma IL-1β levels but reduced the cerebrospinal fluid levels of this cytokine. These results suggest that binge-like EtOH exposure during adolescence causes changes in the central nervous system that can impair the febrile response that can be observed after the cessation of EtOH exposure. These changes were reversible and appeared to involve the LPS / IL-1β system.

28072668|t|Genital and Extragenital Gonorrhea and Chlamydia in Children and Adolescents Evaluated for Sexual Abuse
28072668|a|The aim of this study was to describe the use of a nucleic acid amplification test in detecting genital and extragenital Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) in children and adolescents assessed for sexual abuse / assault. The charts of children aged 0 to 17 years, consecutively evaluated for sexual victimization, in emergency department and outpatient settings were reviewed. Data extracted included age, sex, type of sexual contact, anogenital findings, previous sexual contact, toxicology results, and sites tested for NG and CT. Of the 1319 patients who were tested, 579 were tested at more than 1 site, and 120 had at least 1 infected site. Chlamydia trachomatis was identified in 104 patients, and NG was found in 33. In bivariate analysis, a positive test was associated with female sex, age older than 11 years, previous sexual contact, acute or healed genital injury, drug/alcohol intoxication, and examination within 72 hours of sexual contact. Fifty-one patients had positive anal tests, and 24 had positive oral tests. More than 75% of patients with positive extragenital tests had additional positive tests or anogenital injury. Most with a positive anal (59%) or oral (77%) test did not report that the assailant's genitals came into contact with that site. Positive tests for NG and CT in patients evaluated for sexual victimization may represent infection from sexual contact, contiguous spread of infection, or the presence of infected assailant secretions. Relying on patient reports of symptoms, or types of sexual contact, to determine need for testing may miss NG and CT infections in patients evaluated for sexual victimization.

28074357|t|The Longitudinal Effects of Parenting on Adaptive Behavior in Children with Fragile X Syndrome
28074357|a|Several studies have reported declines in adaptive behavior amongst children with fragile X syndrome (FXS) starting in middle childhood. We examined the effects of maternal responsivity on adaptive behavior in 55 children with FXS visited 5-6 times in their homes from early through middle childhood. Our analyses indicated that sustained maternal responsivity had a significant positive impact on the trajectories of communication and to a lesser extent other adaptive behavior domains through middle childhood with many effects remaining significant after controlling for autism symptoms and developmental level. For children who showed declines in adaptive behavior during middle childhood, sustained high levels of maternal responsivity minimized the amount of decline observed in the communication, socialization, and daily living domains.

28076405|t|Development and Validation of a New Reliable Method for the Diagnosis of Avian Botulism
28076405|a|Liver is a reliable matrix for laboratory confirmation of avian botulism using real-time PCR. Here, we developed, optimized, and validated the analytical steps preceding PCR to maximize the detection of Clostridium botulinum group III in avian liver. These pre - PCR steps included enrichment incubation of the whole liver (maximum 25 g) at 37°C for at least 24 h in an anaerobic chamber and DNA extraction using an enzymatic digestion step followed by a DNA purification step. Conditions of sample storage before analysis appear to have a strong effect on the detection of group III C. botulinum strains and our results recommend storage at temperatures below -18°C. Short-term storage at 5°C is possible for up to 24 h, but a decrease in sensitivity was observed at 48 h of storage at this temperature. Analysis of whole livers (maximum 25 g) is required and pooling samples before enrichment culturing must be avoided. Pooling is however possible before or after DNA extraction under certain conditions. Whole livers should be 10-fold diluted in enrichment medium and homogenized using a Pulsifier® blender (Microgen, Surrey, UK) instead of a conventional paddle blender. Spiked liver samples showed a limit of detection of 5 spores /g liver for types C and D and 250 spores /g for type E. Using the method developed here, the analysis of 268 samples from 73 suspected outbreaks showed 100% specificity and 95.35% sensitivity compared with other PCR -based methods considered as reference. The mosaic type C / D was the most common neurotoxin type found in examined samples, which included both wild and domestic birds.

28077898|t|Quality Improvement of Liver Ultrasound Images Using Fuzzy Techniques
28077898|a|Liver ultrasound images are so common and are applied so often to diagnose diffuse liver diseases like fatty liver. However, the low quality of such images makes it difficult to analyze them and diagnose diseases. The purpose of this study, therefore, is to improve the contrast and quality of liver ultrasound images. In this study, a number of image contrast enhancement algorithms which are based on fuzzy logic were applied to liver ultrasound images - in which the view of kidney is observable - using Matlab2013b to improve the image contrast and quality which has a fuzzy definition; just like image contrast improvement algorithms using a fuzzy intensification operator, contrast improvement algorithms applying fuzzy image histogram hyperbolization, and contrast improvement algorithms by fuzzy IF-THEN rules. With the measurement of Mean Squared Error and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio obtained from different images, fuzzy methods provided better results, and their implementation - compared with histogram equalization method - led both to the improvement of contrast and visual quality of images and to the improvement of liver segmentation algorithms results in images. Comparison of the four algorithms revealed the power of fuzzy logic in improving image contrast compared with traditional image processing algorithms. Moreover, contrast improvement algorithm based on a fuzzy intensification operator was selected as the strongest algorithm considering the measured indicators. This method can also be used in future studies on other ultrasound images for quality improvement and other image processing and analysis applications.

28078640|t|Development of the pediatric quality of life inventory neurofibromatosis type 1 module items for children, adolescents and young adults: qualitative methods
28078640|a|Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is arguably one of the most important measures in evaluating effectiveness of clinical treatments. At present, there is no disease - specific outcome measure to assess the HRQOL of children, adolescents and young adults with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1). This study aimed to develop the items and support the content validity for the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory™ (PedsQL™) NF1 Module for children, adolescents and young adults. The iterative process included multiphase qualitative methods including a literature review, survey of expert opinions, semi-structured interviews, cognitive interviews and pilot testing. Fifteen domains were derived from the qualitative methods, with content saturation achieved, resulting in 115 items. The domains include skin, pain, pain impact, pain management, cognitive functioning, speech, fine motor, balance, vision, perceived physical appearance, communication, worry, treatment, medicines and gastrointestinal symptoms. This study is limited because all participants are recruited from a single - site. Qualitative methods support the content validity for the PedsQL™ NF1 Module for children, adolescents and young adults. The PedsQL™ NF1 Module is now undergoing national multisite field testing for the psychometric validation of the instrument development.

28079476|t|Mimiviruses and the Human Interferon System: Viral Evasion of Classical Antiviral Activities, But Inhibition By a Novel Interferon-β Regulated Immunomodulatory Pathway
28079476|a|In this review we discuss the role of mimiviruses as potential human pathogens focusing on clinical and evolutionary evidence. We also propose a novel antiviral immunomodulatory pathway controlled by interferon-β (IFN-β) and mediated by immune-responsive gene 1 (IRG1) and itaconic acid, its product. Acanthamoeba polyphaga Mimivirus (APMV) was isolated from amoebae in a hospital while investigating a pneumonia outbreak. Mimivirus ubiquity and role as protist pathogens are well understood, and its putative status as a human pathogen has been gaining strength as more evidence is being found. The study of APMV and human cells interaction revealed that the virus is able to evade the IFN system by inhibiting the regulation of interferon -stimulated genes, suggesting that the virus and humans have had host-pathogen interactions. It also has shown that the virus is capable of growing on IFN-α2, but not on IFN-β - treated cells, hinting at an exclusive IFN-β antiviral pathway. Our hypothesis based on preliminary data and published articles is that IFN-β preferentially upregulates IRG1 in human macrophagic cells, which in turn produces itaconic acid. This metabolite links metabolism to antiviral activity by inactivating the virus, in a novel immunomodulatory pathway relevant for APMV infections and probably to other infectious diseases as well.

28080032|t|Heteroprotein Complex Formation of Bovine Lactoferrin and Pea Protein Isolate: A Multiscale Structural Analysis
28080032|a|Associative electrostatic interactions between two oppositely charged globular proteins, lactoferrin (LF) and pea protein isolate (PPI), the latter being a mixture of vicilin, legumin, and convicilin, was studied with a specific PPI / LF molar ratio at room temperature. Structural aspects of the electrostatic complexes probed at different length scales were investigated as a function of pH by means of different complementary techniques, namely, with dynamic light scattering, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), turbidity measurements, and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Irrespective of the applied techniques, the results consistently displayed that complexation between LF and PPI did occur. In an optimum narrow range of pH 5.0-5.8, a viscous liquid phase of complex coacervate was obtained upon mild centrifugation of the turbid LF - PPI mixture with a maximum Rh, turbidity and the ζ-potential being close to zero observed at pH 5.4. In particular, the SAXS data demonstrated that the coacervates were densely assembled with a roughly spherical size distribution exhibiting a maximum extension of ∼80 nm at pH 5.4. Equally, AFM image analysis showed size distributions containing most frequent cluster sizes around 40-80 nm with spherical to elliptical shapes (axis aspect ratio ≤ 2) as well as less frequent elongated to chainlike structures. The most frequently observed compact complexes, we identify as mainly leading to LF - PPI coacervation, whereas for the less frequent chain-like aggregates, we hypothesize that additionally PPI - PPI facilitated complexes exist.

28084862|t|Visual outcome, endocrine function and tumor control after fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy of craniopharyngiomas in adults: findings in a prospective cohort
28084862|a|The purpose of this study was to examine visual outcome, endocrine function and tumor control in a prospective cohort of craniopharyngioma patients, treated with fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy (FSRT). Sixteen adult patients with craniopharyngiomas were eligible for analysis. They were treated with linear accelerator-based FSRT during 1999-2015. In all cases, diagnosis was confirmed by histological analysis. The prescription dose to the tumor was 54 Gy (median, range 48-54) in 1.8 or 2.0 Gy per fraction, and the maximum radiation dose to the optic nerves and chiasm was 54.2 Gy (median, range 48.6-60.0) for the cohort. Serial ophthalmological and endocrine evaluations and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were performed at regular intervals. Median follow-up was 3.3 years (range 1.1-14.1), 3.7 years (range 0.8-15.2), and 3.6 years (range 0.7-13.1) for visual outcome, endocrine function, and tumor control, respectively. Visual acuity impairment was present in 10 patients (62.5%) and visual field defects were present in 12 patients (75%) before FSRT. One patient developed radiation-induced optic neuropathy at seven years after FSRT. Thirteen of 16 patients (81.3%) had pituitary deficiency before FSRT, and did not develop further pituitary deficiency after FSRT. Mean tumor volume pre- FSRT was 2.72 cm(3) (range 0.20-9.90) and post- FSRT 1.2 cm(3) (range 0.00-13.10). Tumor control rate was 81.3% at two, five, and 10 years after FSRT. FSRT was relatively safe in this prospective cohort of craniopharyngiomas, with only one case of radiation-induced optic neuropathy and no case of new endocrinopathy. Tumor control rate was acceptable.

28086772|t|Scutellaria barbata D. Don extract inhibits the tumor growth through down-regulating of Treg cells and manipulating Th1 / Th17 immune response in hepatoma H22 -bearing mice
28086772|a|Previous studies showed Scutellaria barbata D. Don extract (SBE) is a potent inhibitor in hepatoma and could improve immune function of hepatoma H22 -bearing mice. However, the immunomodulatory function of SBE on the tumor growth of hepatoma remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the anti-tumor effects of SBE on hepatoma H22 -bearing mice and explore the underlying immunomodulatory function. The hepatoma H22 -bearing mice were treated by SBE for 30 days. The effect of SBE on the proliferation of HepG2 cells in vitro, the growth of transplanted tumor, the cytotoxicity of natural killer (NK) cells in spleen, the amount of CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) Treg cells and Th17 cells in tumor tissue, and the levels of IL-10, TGF-β, IL-17A, IL-2, and IFN-γ in serum of the hepatoma H22 -bearing mice was observered. IL-17A was injected to the SBE treated mice from day 9 post H22 inoculation to examine its effect on tumor growth. SBE treatment inhibited the proliferation of HepG2 cells in vitro with a dose-dependent manner and significantly suppressed the tumor growth of hepatoma H22 -bearing mice. Meanwhile, it increased NK cells' cytotoxicity in spleen, down-regulated the amount of CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) Treg cells and Th17 cells in tumor tissue, and decreased IL-10, TGF-β, and IL-17A levels (P < 0.01) whereas increased IL-2 and IFN-γ levels (P < 0.01) in the serum of hepatoma H22 -bearing mice. Moreover, administration of recombinant mouse IL-17A reversed the anti-tumor effects of SBE. SBE could inhibit the proliferation of HepG2 cells in vitro. Meanwhile, SBE also could inhibit the growth of H22 implanted tumor in hepatoma H22 -bearing mice, and this function might be associated with immunomodulatory activity through down-regulating of Treg cells and manipulating Th1 / Th17 immune response.

28086838|t|Clinical characteristics of genital chlamydia infection in pelvic inflammatory disease
28086838|a|Chlamydia infection in acute pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is associated with serious complications including ectopic pregnancy, tubal infertility, Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome and tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA). This study compared clinical and laboratory data between PID with and without chlamydia infection. The medical records of 497 women who were admitted with PID between 2002 and 2011 were reviewed. The patients were divided into two groups (PID with and without chlamydia infection), which were compared in terms of the patients' characteristics, clinical presentation, and laboratory findings, including inflammatory markers. The chlamydia and non-chlamydia groups comprised 175 and 322 women, respectively. The patients in the chlamydia group were younger and had a higher rate of TOA, a longer mean hospital stay, and had undergone more surgeries than the patients in the non- chlamydia group. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and CA-125 level were higher in the chlamydia group than in the non-chlamydia group, but there was no significant difference in the white blood cell count between the two groups. The CA-125 level was the strongest predictor of chlamydia infection, followed by the ESR and CRP level. The area under the receiving operating curve for CA-125, ESR, and CRP was 0.804, 0.755, and 0.663, respectively. Chlamydia infection in acute PID is associated with increased level of inflammatory markers, such as CA-125, ESR and CRP, incidence of TOA, operation risk, and longer hospitalization.

28087131|t|Incidence and effect of variant histology on oncological outcomes in patients with bladder cancer treated with radical cystectomy
28087131|a|We sought to describe incidence of histological variants after radical cystectomy (RC) due to bladder cancer (BCa). Moreover, we investigated survival outcomes accounting for this parameter. We retrospectively evaluated data from 1,067 patients with BCa treated with RC between 1990 and 2013 at a single tertiary care referral center. All specimen were evaluated by dedicated uropathologists. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses tested the effect of different histopathological variant on recurrence, cancer-specific mortality (CSM), and overall mortality (OM) after accounting for all available confounders. Of 1,067 patients, 729 (68.3%) harbored pure urothelial BCa while 338 (31.7%) were found to have a variant. Considering uncommon variants, 21 (2.0%) were sarcomatoid, 10 (0.9%) lymphoepitelial, 19 (1.8%) small cell, 109 (10.2%) squamous, 89 (8.3%) micropapillary, 23 (2.2%) glandular, 34 (3.2%) mixed variants, and 33 (3.1%) were found with other types of variants. With a median follow-up of 6.2 years, 343 recurrence, 365 CSM, and 451 OM were recorded, respectively. At multivariable Cox regression analyses, the presence of small cell variant was associated with higher recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.47, P<0.001), CSM (HR = 3.30, P<0.04), and OM (HR = 2.97, P<0.003) as compared with pure urothelial cancer. Conversely, no survival differences were recorded considering other histological variants (all P> 0.1). Our study confirms that histological variant is not an infrequent event at RC specimen. However, in our single-center series, only patients found with small cell variant were associated with a negative effect on survival after RC.

28087217|t|Psychometric properties of the Japanese version of short forms of the Pain Catastrophizing Scale in participants with musculoskeletal pain: A cross-sectional study
28087217|a|The Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) is a commonly used as measure of pain catastrophizing. The scale comprises 13 items related to magnification, rumination, and helplessness. To facilitate quick screening and to reduce participant's burden, the four- item and six- item short forms of the English version of the PCS were developed. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of a Japanese version of the short forms of PCS using a contemporary approach called Rasch analysis. A total of 216 patients with musculoskeletal disorders were recruited in this study. Participants completed study measures, which included the pain intensity, the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), and the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK). Furthermore, the four- item (items 3, 6, 8, and 11) and six- item (items 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, and 13) short forms of the Japanese version of PCS were measured. We used Rasch analysis to analyze the psychometric properties of the original, four- item, and six- item short forms of PCS. Rasch analysis showed that both short forms of PCS had acceptable internal consistency, unidimensionality, and no notable DIF and were functional on the category rating scale. However, four- item short form of PCS had two misfit items. Six- item short form of PCS has acceptable psychometric properties and is suitable for use in participants with musculoskeletal pain. Thus, six- item can be used as brief instruments to evaluate pain catastrophizing.

28088177|t|A novel quantitative PCR detects Babesia infection in patients not identified by currently available non-nucleic acid amplification tests
28088177|a|Ticks transmit Babesia microti, the causative agents of babesiosis in North America and Europe. Babesiosis is now endemic in Northeastern USA and affects people of all ages. Babesia species infect erythrocytes and can be transmitted through blood transfusion. Whole blood and blood products, which are not tested for Babesia, can cause transfusion - transmitted babesiosis (TTB) resulting in severe consequences in the immuno-compromised patients. The purpose of this study was epidemiological evaluation of babesiosis in a tick-infested state. We examined blood samples from 192 patients who visited clinics during the active tick-borne diseases season, using a newly developed qPCR assay that uses the specific molecular beacon probe. Due to the absence of clear symptomology, clinical laboratories did not test 131 samples by IFA, FISH or microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained blood smears. Babesia infection was detected in all age groups by FISH and microscopy; notably patients >40 years of age represented 64% of tested samples and 13% were younger patients. We tested all samples using qPCR and found that 38% were positive for Babesia. Of 28 samples that were positive by FISH, 27 (96%) were also positive by qPCR indicating high congruency between nucleic acid based tests. Interestingly, of 78 asymptomatic samples not tested by FISH, 22 were positive by our qPCR. Direct detection of Babesia relies upon microscopic examination of patient blood smears, which is labor intensive, difficult to scale up, requires specific expertise and is hence, often not performed. In fact, a clinical laboratory examined only 23 of 86 blood samples obtained from two different counties by microscopy. By considering individuals positive for Babesia infection when results from currently available microscopy, FISH or serological tests were positive, we found that our qPCR is highly sensitive (96.2%) and showed a specificity of 70.5% for Babesia. Robust qPCR using specific probes can be highly useful for efficient and appropriate diagnosis of babesiosis in patients in conjunction with conventional diagnostics, or as a stand-alone test, especially for donated blood screening. The use of a nucleic acid amplification test based screening of blood and blood products could prevent TTB.

28088402|t|Historical relationships of three enigmatic phasianid genera (Aves: Galliformes) inferred using phylogenomic and mitogenomic data
28088402|a|The phylogeny of the Phasianidae (pheasants, partridges, and allies) has been studied extensively. However, these studies have largely ignored three enigmatic genera because of scarce DNA source material and limited overlapping phylogenetic data: blood pheasants (Ithaginis), snow partridges (Lerwa), and long-billed partridges (Rhizothera). Thus, phylogenetic positions of these three genera remain uncertain in what is otherwise a well-resolved phylogeny. Previous studies using different data types place Lerwa and Ithaginis in similar positions, but the absence of overlapping data means the relationship between them could not be inferred. Rhizothera was originally described in the genus Perdix (true partridges), although a partial cytochrome b (CYB) sequence suggests it is sister to Pucrasia (koklass pheasant). To identify robust relationships among Ithaginis, Lerwa, Rhizothera, and their phasianid relatives, we used 3692 ultra-conserved element (UCE) loci and complete mitogenomes from 19 species including previously hypothesized relatives of the three focal genera and representatives from all major phasianid clades. We used DNA extracted from historical specimen toepads for species that lacked fresh tissue in museum collections. Maximum likelihood and multispecies coalescent UCE analyses strongly supported Lerwa sister to a large clade which included Ithaginis at its base, and also including turkey, grouse, typical pheasants, tragopans, Pucrasia, and Perdix. Rhizothera was also in this clade, sister to a diverse group comprising Perdix, typical pheasants, Pucrasia, turkey and grouse. Mitogenomic genealogies differed from UCEs topologies, supporting a sister relationship between Ithaginis and Lerwa rather than a grade. The position of Rhizothera using mitogenomes depended on analytical choices. Unpartitioned and codon-based analyses placed Rhizothera sister to a tragopan clade, whereas a partitioned DNA model of the mitogenome was congruent with UCE results. In all mitogenome analyses, Pucrasia was sister to a clade including Perdix and the typical pheasants with high support, in contrast to UCEs and published nuclear intron data. Due to the strong support and consistent topology provided by all UCE analyses, we have identified phylogenetic relationships of these three enigmatic, poorly-studied, phasianid taxa.

28091848|t|A novel combination treatment to stimulate bone healing and regeneration under hypoxic conditions: photobiomodulation and melatonin
28091848|a|Melatonin has anabolic effects on the bone, even under hypoxia, and laser irradiation has been shown to improve osteoblastic differentiation. The aim of this study was to investigate whether laser irradiation and melatonin would have synergistic effects on osteoblastic differentiation and mineralization under hypoxic conditions. MC3T3-E1 cells were exposed to 1% oxygen tension for the hypoxia condition. The cells were divided into four groups: G1 - osteoblast differentiation medium only (as the hypoxic condition), G2 - treatment with 50 μM melatonin only, G3 - laser irradiation (808 nm, 80 mW, GaAlAs diode) only, and G4 - treatment with 50 μM melatonin and laser irradiation (808 nm, 80 mW, GaAlAs diode). Immunoblotting showed that osterix expression was markedly increased in the melatonin - treated and laser-irradiated cells at 48 and 72 h. In addition, alkaline phosphatase activity significantly increased and continued to rise throughout the experiment. Alizarin Red staining showed markedly increased mineralized nodules as compared with only melatonin - treated or laser-irradiated cells at day 7, which significantly increased by day 14. Moreover, when melatonin - treated cells were laser-irradiated, the differentiation and mineralization of cells were found to involve p38 MAPK and PRKD1 signaling mechanisms. However, the enhanced effects of laser irradiation with melatonin were markedly inhibited when the cells were treated with luzindole, a selective melatonin receptor antagonist. Therefore, we concluded that laser irradiation could promote the effect of melatonin on the differentiation and mineralization of MC3T3-E1 cells under hypoxic conditions, and that this process is mediated through melatonin 1/2 receptors and PKRD / p38 signaling pathways.

28092112|t|Aquaporin-2 excretion in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis: Relation to development of renal insufficiency and mortality
28092112|a|Urinary aquaporin-2 (AQP2) is a parameter of water transport in the principal cells in the distal part of the nephron and involved in water retention in cirrhosis and may be a marker of renal function. The aim of the study was to evaluate AQP2 as a predictor of renal insufficiency and death in patients with cirrhosis. Urine samples from 199 patients (90 patients without organ failure [Group 1], 58 patients with organ failure excluding renal failure [Group 2], and 51 patients with organ failure including renal failure [Group 3]) from the CANONIC study were analyzed for urine AQP2 and urine osmolality. There was no difference in AQP2 between the three groups. Urine osmolality was significantly lower in patients in Group 3 versus Group 1 and Group 2 (P = 0.0004). No relation was found between AQP2 and glomerular filtration rate or creatinine; however, AQP2 was a significant predictor of the development of renal insufficiency (P = 0.0485). In a univariate analysis, AQP2 was a significant predictor of 14 and 28-day survival, but this was not confirmed in multivariate analysis. Aquaporin-2 was not associated with disease severity or markers of renal function but was a predictor for the development of renal insufficiency and death. Therefore, its future use as marker of renal insufficiency could be promising, but further research is needed before it can be considered a clinical useful tool.

28092340|t|Decompression Surgery Alone Versus Decompression Plus Fusion in Symptomatic Lumbar Spinal Stenosis: A Swiss Prospective Multi-center Cohort Study with 3 Years of Follow-up
28092340|a|Retrospective analysis of a prospective, multicenter cohort study. To estimate the added effect of surgical fusion as compared to decompression surgery alone in symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis patients with spondylolisthesis. The optimal surgical management of lumbar spinal stenosis patients with spondylolisthesis remains controversial. Patients of the LSOS with confirmed DLSS and spondylolisthesis were enrolled in this study. The outcomes of this study were Spinal Stenosis Measure (SSM) symptoms (score range 1-5, best-worst) and function (1-4) over time, measured at baseline, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months follow-up. In order to quantify the effect of fusion surgery as compared to decompression alone and number of decompressed levels, we used mixed effects models and accounted for the repeated observations in main outcomes (SSM symptoms and SSM function) over time. In addition to individual patients ' random effects, we also fitted random slopes for follow-up time points and compared these two approaches with Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) and the chi-squared test. Confounders were adjusted with fixed effects for age, gender, BMI, diabetes, CIRS musculoskeletal disorders and duration of symptoms. One hundred and thirty-one patients undergoing decompression surgery alone (n = 85) or decompression plus fusion surgery (n = 46) were included in this study. In the multiple mixed effects model the adjusted effect of fusion versus decompression alone surgery on SSM symptoms was 0.06 (95% confidence interval, CI: -0.16 to 0.27) and -0.07 (95% CI: -0.25 to 0.10) on SSM function, respectively. Among the patients with degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis and spondylolisthesis our study confirms that in the two groups, decompression alone and decompression plus fusion, patients distinctively benefited from surgical treatment. When adjusted for confounders, fusion surgery was not associated with a more favorable outcome in both SSM scores as compared to decompression alone surgery. 3.

28097208|t|Muscle synergies after stroke are correlated with perilesional high gamma
28097208|a|Movements can be factored into modules termed " muscle synergies ". After stroke, abnormal synergies are linked to impaired movements; however, their neural basis is not understood. In a single subject, we examined how electrocorticography signals from the perilesional cortex were associated with synergies. The measured synergies contained a mix of both normal and abnormal patterns and were remarkably similar to those described in past work. Interestingly, we found that both normal and abnormal synergies were correlated with perilesional high gamma. Given the link between high gamma and cortical spiking, our results suggest that perilesional spiking may organize synergies after stroke.

28097611|t|Assessing nitrous oxide effect using electroencephalographically -based depth of anesthesia measures cortical state and cortical input
28097611|a|Existing electroencephalography (EEG) based depth of anesthesia monitors cannot reliably track sedative or anesthetic states during n-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist based anesthesia with ketamine or nitrous oxide (N2O). Here, a physiologically -motivated depth of anesthesia monitoring algorithm based on autoregressive-moving-average (ARMA) modeling and derivative measures of interest, Cortical State (CS) and Cortical Input (CI), is retrospectively applied in an exploratory manner to the NMDA receptor antagonist N2O, an adjuvant anesthetic gas used in clinical practice. Composite Cortical State (CCS) and Composite Cortical State distance (CCSd), two new modifications of CS, along with CS and CI were evaluated on electroencephalographic (EEG) data of healthy control individuals undergoing N2O inhalation up to equilibrated peak gas concentrations of 20, 40 or 60% N2O / O2. In particular, CCSd has been devised to vary consistently for increasing levels of anesthetic concentration independent of the anesthetic's microscopic mode of action for both N2O and propofol. The strongest effects were observed for the 60% peak gas concentration group. For the 50-60% peak gas levels, individuals showed statistically significant reductions in responsiveness compared to rest, and across the group CS and CCS increased by 39 and 42%, respectively, while CCSd was found to decrease by 398%. On the other hand a clear conclusion regarding the changes in CI could not be reached. These results indicate that, contrary to previous depth of anesthesia monitoring measures, the CS, CCS, and especially CCSd measures derived from frontal EEG are potentially useful for differentiating gas concentration and responsiveness levels in people under N2O. On the other hand, determining the utility of CI in this regard will require larger sample sizes and potentially higher gas concentrations. Future work will assess the sensitivity of CS -based and CI measures to other anesthetics and their utility in a clinical environment.

28098510|t|DT MRI microstructural cortical lesion damage does not explain cognitive impairment in MS
28098510|a|We combined double inversion recovery (DIR) and diffusion tensor (DT) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to quantify the severity of cortical lesion (CL) microstructural tissue abnormalities in a large cohort of relapse - onset multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and its contribution to cognitive dysfunction. DIR, DT, dual-echo, and three-dimensional (3D) T1-weighted scans were acquired from 149 MS patients and 40 controls. Cognitively impaired (CI) patients had ⩾2 abnormal neuropsychological tests. Diffusivity values in CLs, cortex, white matter (WM) lesions, and normal-appearing (NA) WM were assessed. Predictors of cognitive impairment were identified using a random forest analysis. Compared to controls, MS patients had lower normalized brain volume (NBV), gray matter volume (GMV), WM volume, lower fractional anisotropy (FA), and higher mean diffusivity in cortex and normal-appearing white matter (NAWM). A total of 44 (29.5%) patients were CI. Compared to cognitively preserved (CP), CI patients had higher T2 WM lesion volume (LV), lower NBV and GMV, and more severe diffusivity abnormalities in WM lesions, cortex, and NAWM. CL measures did not differ between CI and CP patients. Cortex FA, age, disease duration, T2 WM LV, and GMV best predicted MS -related cognitive impairment (C-statistic = 0.88). " Diffuse " GM and NAWM damage and WM lesions, rather than intrinsic CL damage, contribute to cognitive impairment in MS.

28099597|t|Correlation between the histopathology of chronic urticaria and its clinical picture
28099597|a|Chronic urticaria is characterized by transient, pruritic lesions of varying sizes, with central pallor and well-defined edges, with disease duration longer than six weeks. Its cellular infiltrate consists of neutrophils, lymphocytes and eosinophils. There is a subgroup of patients with eosinophilic or neutrophilic urticaria, resistant to the treatment with antihistamines, but that respond to a combination of antihistamine with other drugs. To evaluate the present infiltration in chronic urticaria biopsies and correlate it with the clinical disease activity and response to treatment. Forty-one patients with chronic urticaria were classified according to the score of severity of the disease, response to treatment and type of perivascular infiltrate. Inflammatory infiltrates were divided in eosinophilic (46.30%), neutrophilic and mixed. An association was found between the eosinophilic infiltrate and clinical scores of greater severity (p = 0.002). This association shows that the eosinophilic inflammatory infiltrates denote high clinical activity, which means more severe and exuberant clinical pictures of the disease.

28100136|t|Barriers to access and uptake of antiretroviral therapy among HIV-positive men who have sex with men in Hanoi, Vietnam: from HIV testing to treatment
28100136|a|Little is known about the experiences of Vietnamese men who have sex with men in accessing HIV testing and treatment. We aimed to explore barriers to access and uptake of antiretroviral therapy (ART) among HIV-positive men who have sex with men in Hanoi. During 2015, we conducted qualitative interviews with 35 participants recruited using snowball sampling based on previous research and social networks. Key individual impediments to ART uptake included inadequate preparation for a positive diagnosis and the dual stigmatisation of homosexuality and HIV and its consequences, leading to fear of disclosure of HIV status. Health system barriers included lack of clarity and consistency about how to register for and access ART, failure to protect patient confidentiality and a reticence by providers to discuss sexual identity and same-sex issues. Results suggest fundamental problems in the way HIV testing is currently delivered in Hanoi, including a lack of client-centred counselling, peer support and clear referral pathways. Overcoming these barriers will require educating men who have sex with men about the benefits of routine testing, improving access to quality diagnostic services and building a safe, confidential treatment environment for HIV-positive men to access, receive and remain in care.

28100698|t|Cdc45 - induced loading of human RPA onto single-stranded DNA
28100698|a|Cell division cycle protein 45 (Cdc45) is an essential component of the eukaryotic replicative DNA helicase. We found that human Cdc45 forms a complex with the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding protein RPA. Moreover, it actively loads RPA onto nascent ssDNA. Pull-down assays and surface plasmon resonance studies revealed that Cdc45 - bound RPA complexed with ssDNA in the 8-10 nucleotide binding mode, but dissociated when RPA covered a 30-mer. Real-time analysis of RPA - ssDNA binding demonstrated that Cdc45 catalytically loaded RPA onto ssDNA. This placement reaction required physical contacts of Cdc45 with the RPA70A subdomain. Our results imply that Cdc45 controlled stabilization of the 8- nt RPA binding mode, the subsequent RPA transition into 30-mer mode and facilitated an ordered binding to ssDNA. We propose that a Cdc45 -mediated loading guarantees a seamless deposition of RPA on newly emerging ssDNA at the nascent replication fork.

28101782|t|The antineoplastic drug, trastuzumab, dysregulates metabolism in iPSC -derived cardiomyocytes
28101782|a|The targeted ERBB2 therapy, trastuzumab, has had a tremendous impact on management of patients with HER2+ breast cancer, leading to development and increased use of further HER2 targeted therapies. The major clinical side effect is cardiotoxicity but the mechanism is largely unknown. On the basis that gene expression is known to be altered in multiple models of heart failure, we examined differential gene expression of iPSC -derived cardiomyocytes treated at day 11 with the ERBB2 targeted monoclonal antibody, trastuzumab for 48 h and the small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor of EGFR and ERBB2. Transcriptome sequencing was performed on four replicates from each group (48 h untreated, 48 h trastuzumab and 48 h lapatinib) and differential gene expression analyses were performed on each treatment group relative to untreated cardiomyocytes. 517 and 1358 genes were differentially expressed, p < 0.05, respectively in cardiomyocytes treated with trastuzumab and lapatinib. Gene ontology analyses revealed in cardiomyocytes treated with trastuzumab, significant down-regulation of genes involved in small molecule metabolism (p = 3.22 �— 10(-9)) and cholesterol (p = 0.01) and sterol (p = 0.03) processing. We next measured glucose uptake and lactate production in iPSC -derived cardiomyocytes 13 days post-plating, treated with trastuzumab up to 96 h. We observed significantly decreased glucose uptake from the media of iPSC -derived cardiomyocytes treated with trastuzumab as early as 24 h (p = 0.001) and consistently up to 96 h (p = 0.03). Our study suggests dysregulation of cardiac gene expression and metabolism as key elements of ERBB2 signaling that could potentially be early biomarkers of cardiotoxicity.

28102508|t|Simvastatin Promotes Hematoma Absorption and Reduces Hydrocephalus Following Intraventricular Hemorrhage in Part by Upregulating CD36
28102508|a|We previously found that hematoma worsens hydrocephalus after intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) via increasing iron deposition and aggravating ependymal cilia injury; therefore, promoting hematoma absorption may be a promising strategy for IVH. Recently, some investigations imply that simvastatin has the ability of accelerating hematoma absorption. Thus, this study was designed to examine the efficacy of simvastatin for IVH in rats. Intracerebral hemorrhage with ventricular extension was induced in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats after autologous blood injection. Simvastatin or vehicle was administered orally at 1 day after IVH and then daily for 1 week. MRI studies were performed to measure the volumes of intracranial hematoma and lateral ventricle at days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 after IVH. Motor and neurocognitive functions were assessed at days 1 to 7 and 23 to 28, respectively. Iron deposition, iron -related protein expression, ependymal damage, and histology were detected at day 28. Expression of CD36 scavenger receptor (facilitating phagocytosis) was examined at day 3 after IVH using western blotting and immunofluorescence. Simvastatin significantly increased hematoma absorption ratio, reduced ventricular volume, and attenuated neurological dysfunction post- IVH. In addition, less iron accumulation and more cilia survival was observed in the simvastatin group when compared with the control. What's more, higher expression of CD36 was detected around the hematoma after simvastatin administration. Simvastatin significantly enhanced brain hematoma absorption, alleviated hydrocephalus, and improved neurological recovery after experimental IVH, which may in part by upregulating CD36 expression. Our data suggest that early simvastatin use may be a novel therapy for IVH patients.

28103582|t|AMPK - autophagy inhibition sensitizes icaritin - induced anti-colorectal cancer cell activity
28103582|a|The current research studied the potential effect of autophagy on icaritin - induced anti-colorectal cancer (CRC) cell activity. Treatment of icaritin in both primary and established (HT-29) CRC cells induced feedback activation of autophagy, evidenced by p62 degradation, Beclin-1 and autophagy-related gene-5 (ATG-5) upregulation, as well as light chain 3B (LC3B)- GFP puncta formation. Pharmacological inhibiting of autophagy dramatically potentiated icaritin - induced CRC cell death and apoptosis. Meanwhile, shRNA -mediated knockdown of Beclin-1 or ATG-5 also sensitized icaritin - induced CRC cell death and apoptosis. Icaritin activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling in CRC cells, functioning as the upstream signaling for autophagy activation. shRNA / siRNA -mediated knockdown of AMPKα1 inhibited icaritin - induced autophagy activation, but exacerbated CRC cell death. On the other hand, the AMPK activator compound 13 (C13) or the autophagy activator MHY1485 attenuated icaritin - induced cytotoxicity. In nude mice, icaritin (oral administration)- induced HT-29 tumor growth inhibition was potentiated when combined with AMPKα1 shRNA knockdown in tumors. We conclude that feedback activation of AMPK - autophagy pathway could be a primary resistance factor of icaritin.

28105970|t|Classification of Edible Oils Based on ATR-FTIR Spectral Information During a Long Heating Treatment
28105970|a|Identification of oil type and its QC are important concerns in food control laboratories. Classifying edible oils that have not been used (i.e., unheated) with the aid of vibrational spectroscopy has previously been reported. However, the classification of used (i.e., heat-treated) oils needs special attention. The effect of long heating times on the classification of four kinds of edible oils (canola, corn, frying, and sunflower) based on attenuated total reflectance (ATR)-FTIR spectra was surveyed. The sampling was done on the oils during a 36 h heating process (at 170°C). The ATR-FTIR spectra of the samples were collected in the range of 4000-550 cm-1. Interval extended canonical variates analysis (ECVA), as a variable selection and classification tool, was used to determine the best intervals during the heating procedure for classification. Principal component analysis discriminate analysis, partial least-squares discriminate analysis, and ECVA were performed on the selected intervals and on the total heating time. The effect of autoscaling and mean-centering, as data preprocessing methods, was also investigated. The ECVA method resulted in the best performances for classification, with a 94% cross-validated nonerror rate (one misclassification) for the heating process times of 24-27 and 33-36 h.

28106239|t|Intravitreal chemotherapy in the management of vitreous disease in retinoblastoma
28106239|a|To evaluate the therapeutic outcome of intravitreal melphalan injection in the management of vitreous disease in patients with retinoblastoma. We particularly aimed to assess whether higher melphalan dose with lower number of injections was more effective and associated with fewer side effects. This retrospective, interventional, noncomparative, and nonrandomized study included 39 eyes of 37 patients. Vitreous seeds were classified as dust, sphere, and cloud types. Intravitreal injections were performed through pars plana free of any visible tumor using 30-G needle. Response of the seeds (disappearance, conversion into inactive debris, or progression) and enucleation rate were determined as outcome measures. All patients previously received systemic or intra-arterial chemotherapy. Vitreous seeding was primary in 54% of eyes and secondary in 46% of eyes. Vitreous seeds were classified as dust in 9 (23.1%) eyes, sphere in 24 (61.5%) eyes, and cloud in 6 (15.4%) eyes. Melphalan dose varied between 20 and 40 µg and 20 (51.3%) eyes received >30 µg. The total number of injections was 70 (range 1-5, mean 1.8 per eye). Various types of regression were obtained in 27 (69.2%) eyes. Sphere-type seeds were the most responsive to melphalan. Nonresponse and disease progression were noted in 12 (30.8%) eyes. After a mean follow-up of 11.8 months, 17 (44%) eyes were enucleated. Vitreous hemorrhage (18%) and retinal pigment epithelial alterations (8%) were the most common side effects. Intravitreal melphalan at 30-40 µg in 1 or 2 injections proved effective in 69.2% of eyes with vitreous disease.

28108399|t|Fine structure of the anterior median eyes of the funnel - web spider Agelena labyrinthica (Araneae: Agelenidae)
28108399|a|Only few electron microscopic studies exist on the structure of the main eyes (anterior median eyes, AME) of web spiders. The present paper provides details on the anatomy of the AME in the funnel-web spider Agelena labyrinthica. The retina consists of two separate regions with differently arranged photoreceptor cells. Its central part has sensory cells with rhabdomeres on 2, 3, or 4 sides, whereas those of the ventral retina have only two rhabdomeres on opposite sides. In addition, the rhabdomeres of the ventral retina are arranged in a specific way: Whereas in the most ventral part they form long tangential rows, those towards the center are detached and are arranged radially. All sensory cells are wrapped by unpigmented pigment cell processes. In agelenid spiders the axons of the sensory cells exit from the middle of the cell body; their fine structure and course through the eye cup is described in detail. In the central part of the retina efferent nerve fibres were found forming synapses along the distal region of the receptor cells. A muscle is attached laterally to each eye cup that allows mainly rotational movements of the eyes. The optical performance (image resolution) of these main eyes with relatively few visual cells is discussed.

28111379|t|Knocking down TCF8 inhibits high glucose - and angiotensin II - induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition in podocytes
28111379|a|Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a physiological phenomenon in mammalian embryogenesis by which epithelial cells become mesenchymal stem cells. Studies have indicated that an inappropriate EMT plays a key role in a variety of pathogenic processes such as embryonic development and tumor metastasis. Moreover, recent studies have indicated EMT also plays an important role in renal fibrosis. In the current study, glucose and angiotensin II promoted EMT in podocytes as well as changes in the cellular morphology of podocytes. A high concentration of glucose and angiotensin II also promoted podocyte movement and migration. Moreover, a high concentration of glucose and angiotensin II promoted TCF8 expression. Inhibiting TCF8 expression with siRNA reversed EMT in podocytes in the presence of a high concentration of glucose and angiotensin. Inhibiting TCF8 expression also reversed changes in cellular morphology and podocyte movement and migration. Therefore, glucose and angiotensin II may promote EMT in podocytes via TCF8.

28113047|t|Temporal upregulation of host surface receptors provides a window of opportunity for bacterial adhesion and disease
28113047|a|Host surface receptors provide bacteria with a foothold from which to attach, colonize and, in some cases, invade tissue and elicit human disease. In this review, we discuss several key host receptors and cognate adhesins that function in bacterial pathogenesis. In particular, we examine the elevated expression of host surface receptors such as CEACAM-1, CEACAM-6, ICAM-1 and PAFR in response to specific stimuli. We explore how upregulated receptors, in turn, expose the host to a range of bacterial infections in the respiratory tract. It is apparent that exploitation of receptor induction for bacterial adherence is not unique to one body system, but is also observed in the central nervous, gastrointestinal and urogenital systems. Prokaryotic pathogens which utilize this mechanism for their infectivity include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis and Escherichia coli. A number of approaches have been used, in both in vitro and in vivo experimental models, to inhibit bacterial attachment to temporally expressed host receptors. Some of these novel strategies may advance future targeted interventions for the prevention and treatment of bacterial disease.

28115057|t|Optogenetic Demonstration of Functional Innervation of Mouse Colon by Neurons Derived From Transplanted Neural Cells
28115057|a|Cell therapy offers the potential to treat gastrointestinal motility disorders caused by diseased or absent enteric neurons. We examined whether neurons generated from transplanted enteric neural cells provide a functional innervation of bowel smooth muscle in mice. Enteric neural cells expressing the light-sensitive ion channel, channelrhodopsin, were isolated from the fetal or postnatal mouse bowel and transplanted into the distal colon of 3- to 4- week -old wild-type recipient mice. Intracellular electrophysiological recordings of responses to light stimulation of the transplanted cells were made from colonic smooth muscle cells in recipient mice. Electrical stimulation of endogenous enteric neurons was used as a control. The axons of graft -derived neurons formed a plexus in the circular muscle layer. Selective stimulation of graft -derived cells by light resulted in excitatory and inhibitory junction potentials, the electrical events underlying contraction and relaxation, respectively, in colonic muscle cells. Graft -derived excitatory and inhibitory motor neurons released the same neurotransmitters as endogenous motor neurons - acetylcholine and a combination of adenosine triphosphate and nitric oxide, respectively. Graft -derived neurons also included interneurons that provided synaptic inputs to motor neurons, but the pharmacologic properties of interneurons varied with the age of the donors from which enteric neural cells were obtained. Enteric neural cells transplanted into the bowel give rise to multiple functional types of neurons that integrate and provide a functional innervation of the smooth muscle of the bowel wall. Circuits composed of both motor neurons and interneurons were established, but the age at which cells are isolated influences the neurotransmitter phenotype of interneurons that are generated.

28117211|t|Assessment of Vascular Stent Heating with Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation
28117211|a|A high proportion of patients with stroke do not qualify for repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) clinical studies due to the presence of metallic stents. The ultimate concern is that any metal could become heated due to eddy currents. However, to date, no clinical safety data are available regarding the risk of metallic stents heating with rTMS. We tested the safety of common rTMS protocols (1 Hz and 10 Hz) with stents used commonly in stroke, nitinol and elgiloy. In our method, stents were tested in gelled saline at 2 different locations: at the center and at the lobe of the coil. In addition, at each location, stent heating was evaluated in 3 different orientations: parallel to the long axis of coil, parallel to the short axis of the coil, and perpendicular to the plane of the coil. We found that stents did not heat to more than 1°C with either 1 Hz rTMS or 10 Hz rTMS in any configuration or orientation. Heating in general was greater at the lobe when the stent was oriented perpendicularly. Our study represents a new method for ex vivo quantification of stent heating. We have found that heating of stents was well below the Food and Drug Administration standards of 2°C. Thus, our study paves the way for in vivo testing of rTMS (≤10 Hz) in the presence of implanted magnetic resonance imaging - compatible stents in animal studies. When planning human safety studies though, geometry, orientation, and location relative to the coil would be important to consider as well.

28118200|t|Clinical Observation of Treatment of Chronic Subdural Hematoma With Novel Double Needle Minimally Invasive Aspiration Technology
28118200|a|The aim of the present study was to explore the clinical effects, including the prevention of complications, of the treatment of chronic subdural hematoma with double needle aspiration. The clinical data of 31 patients with chronic subdural hematoma treated by double YL-1 needle double skull drilling and 31 controls treated by traditional drilling and drainage were analyzed retrospectively. In the YL-1 needle group, only 1 patient was with hematoma recurrence, 1 patient was with intracranial pneumocephalus, and the remaining patients who were followed up for 3 months achieved a clinical cure. In the traditional drilling and drainage group, 13 patients were with hematoma recurrence within 3 months after the operation and 7 patients were with postoperative intracranial pneumocephalus. The method of double YL-1 needle is better than the traditional drilling and drainage method for the treatment of chronic subdural hematoma because it reduces the postoperative recurrence rate and complications.

28118752|t|The impact of adjunctive guanfacine extended release on stimulant adherence in children / adolescents with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder
28118752|a|To assess stimulant adherence among children / adolescents with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) augmenting stimulants with guanfacine extended-release (GXR). Inclusion criteria: 6-17 years, ≥1 ADHD diagnosis, ≥1 long-acting and/or short-acting stimulant with GXR augmentation. Modified medication possession ratio (mMPR; days medication available / days in period, excluding medication holidays) was assessed; mMPR < 0.80 nonadherent. Regression models assessed change in mMPR adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics. Among patients nonadherent to stimulants pre - augmentation (n = 165), unadjusted mean (SD) pre - and post - stimulant mMPRs were 0.68 (0.11) and 0.87 (0.16). Adjusted mean change in mMPR was 0.20 for long-acting versus 0.18 for short-acting stimulants (p = 0.34). Among patients nonadherent to stimulants, GXR augmentation was associated with increased stimulant adherence.

28118814|t|Bxb1 phage recombinase assists genome engineering in Drosophila melanogaster
28118814|a|Rapid and reliable genome modifications provide the basis for detailed in vivo functional analysis of any genomic entity (gene, regulatory DNA, non-coding RNA, etc). With the advent of CRISPR / Cas9 genome editing technology, manipulation of a particular genomic locus has become a routine undertaking in variety of model organisms, including the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. To further diversify the available tools for genome engineering, we successfully harnessed the phage recombinase Bxb1 to perform recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) in D. melanogaster. We demonstrate that Bxb1 possesses highly efficient recombinase activity and could be used alone or in conjunction with other currently available recombinases for creating platforms for cassette exchange of targeted loci.

28119222|t|Tailor-made drug carrier: Comparison of formation-dependent physicochemical properties within self-assembled aggregates for an optimal drug carrier
28119222|a|Self-assembled surfactant aggregates, such as micelles and vesicles, have been investigated for their application as drug carriers in the treatment of various diseases. However, the characteristics that decide which aggregate is the best drug carrier for each disease have not yet been clarified. In order to design an optimal drug carrier for each disease, various kinds of self-assembled aggregates, such as spherical micelles, lens-like vesicles, and tube-like vesicles, were evaluated by " multiple techniques " including dynamic light scattering, differential scanning calorimetry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and fluorescence measurement using the Laurdan probe. These studies led to the compilation of a database on the formation-dependent properties of self-assembled aggregates. As the relationship between physicochemical properties of self-assembled aggregates and their functions as drug carriers have been extensively reported, this database can be utilized for designing an optimal drug carrier, i.e., a tailor-made drug carrier.

28122499|t|Uridine stimulate laxative effect in the loperamide - induced constipation of SD rats through regulation of the mAChRs signaling pathway and mucin secretion
28122499|a|Uridine (Urd), which has been reported as a major component of RNA, plays an important role in various biological process including neuroprotection, biochemical modulation and glycolysis, although its role in constipation has yet to be established. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the laxative effects of Urd on chronic constipation. The constipation phenotypes and their related mechanisms were investigated in the transverse colons of SD rats with loperamide (Lop)- induced constipation after treatment with 100 mg/kg of Urd. The number, weight and water contents of stools were significantly higher in the Lop + Urd treated group than the Lop + Vehicle treated group, while food intake and water consumption of the same group were maintained at a constant level. The thickness of the mucosa layer, muscle and flat luminal surface, as well as the number of goblet cells, paneth cells and lipid droplets were enhanced in the Lop + Urd treated group. Furthermore, the expression of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors M2 and M3 (mAChR M2 and M3) at the transcriptional and translational level was recovered in the Lop + Urd treated group, while some markers such as Gα and inositol triphosphate (IP3) in their downstream signaling pathway were completely recovered by Urd treatment. Moreover, the ability for mucin secretion and the expression of membrane water channel (aquaporine 8, AQP8) were increased significantly in the Lop + Urd treated group compared with Lop + Vehicle treated group. Finally, the activity of Urd was confirmed in primary smooth muscle of rat intestine cells (pRISMC) based on Gα expression and IP3 concentration. The results of the present study provide the first strong evidence that Urd can be considered an important candidate for improving chronic constipation induced by Lop treatment in animal models.

28123107|t|Characterization of Phytochrome Interacting Factors from the Moss Physcomitrella patens Illustrates Conservation of Phytochrome Signaling Modules in Land Plants
28123107|a|Across the plant kingdom, phytochrome (PHY) photoreceptors play an important role during adaptive and developmental responses to light. In Arabidopsis thaliana, light-activated PHYs accumulate in the nucleus, where they regulate downstream signaling components, such as phytochrome interacting factors (PIFs). PIFs are transcription factors that act as repressors of photomorphogenesis; their inhibition by PHYs leads to substantial changes in gene expression. The nuclear function of PHYs, however, has so far been investigated in only a few non-seed plants. Here, we identified putative target genes of PHY signaling in the moss Physcomitrella patens and found light-regulated genes that are putative orthologs of PIF-controlled genes in Arabidopsis. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that an ancestral PIF-like gene was already present in streptophyte algae, i.e., before the water-to-land transition of plants. The PIF homologs in the genome of P. patens resemble Arabidopsis PIFs in their protein domain structure, molecular properties, and physiological effects, albeit with notable differences in the motif-dependent PHY interaction. Our results suggest that P. patens PIFs are involved in PHY signaling. The PHY-PIF signaling node that relays light signals to target genes has been largely conserved during land plant evolution, with evidence of lineage-specific diversification.

28125105|t|Conditional reprogramming and long-term expansion of normal and tumor cells from human biospecimens
28125105|a|Historically, it has been difficult to propagate cells in vitro that are derived directly from human tumors or healthy tissue. However, in vitro preclinical models are essential tools for both the study of basic cancer biology and the promotion of translational research, including drug discovery and drug target identification. This protocol describes conditional reprogramming (CR), which involves coculture of irradiated mouse fibroblast feeder cells with normal and tumor human epithelial cells in the presence of a Rho kinase inhibitor (Y-27632). CR cells can be used for various applications, including regenerative medicine, drug sensitivity testing, gene expression profiling and xenograft studies. The method requires a pathologist to differentiate healthy tissue from tumor tissue, and basic tissue culture skills. The protocol can be used with cells derived from both fresh and cryopreserved tissue samples. As approximately 1 million cells can be generated in 7 d, the technique is directly applicable to diagnostic and predictive medicine. Moreover, the epithelial cells can be propagated indefinitely in vitro, yet retain the capacity to become fully differentiated when placed into conditions that mimic their natural environment.

28125454|t|Types of internal facilitation activities in hospitals implementing evidence-based interventions
28125454|a|Implementation models, frameworks, and theories recognize the importance of activities that facilitate implementation success. However, little is known about internal facilitation activities that hospital personnel engage in during implementation efforts. The aim of the study was to examine internal facilitation activities at 10 critical access hospitals in rural Iowa during their implementation of TeamSTEPPS, a patient safety intervention, and to identify characteristics that distinguish different types of facilitation activities. We followed 10 critical access hospitals for 2 years after the onset of implementation, conducting quarterly interviews with key informants. On the basis of the transcripts from the first two quarters, a coding template was developed using inductive analyses. The template was then applied deductively to code all interview transcripts. Using comparative analysis, we examined the characteristics that distinguish between the facilitation types. We identified four types of facilitation activities - Leadership, Buy-in, Customization, and Accountability. Individuals and teams engaged in different types of facilitation activities, both in a planned and an ad hoc manner. These activities targeted at both people and practices and exhibited varying temporal patterns (start and peak time). There are four types of facilitation activities that hospitals engage in while implementing evidence-based practices, offering a parsimonious way to characterize facilitation activities. New theoretical and empirical research opportunities are discussed. Understanding the types of facilitation activities and their distinguishing characteristics can assist managers in planning and executing implementations of evidence-based interventions.

28129043|t|Directing traffic on DNA -How transcription factors relieve or induce transcriptional interference
28129043|a|Transcriptional interference (TI) is increasingly recognized as a widespread mechanism of gene control, particularly given the pervasive nature of transcription, both sense and antisense, across all kingdoms of life. Here, we discuss how transcription factor binding kinetics strongly influence the ability of a transcription factor to relieve or induce TI.

28131759|t|Acoustic startle response in rats predicts inter-individual variation in fear extinction
28131759|a|Although a large portion of the population is exposed to a traumatic event at some point, only a small percentage of the population develops post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), suggesting the presence of predisposing factors. Abnormal acoustic startle response (ASR) has been shown to be associated with PTSD, implicating it as a potential predictor of the development of PTSD -like behavior. Since poor extinction and retention of extinction learning are characteristic of PTSD patients, it is of interest to determine if abnormal ASR is predictive of development of such deficits. To determine whether baseline ASR has utility in predicting the development of PTSD -like behavior, the relationship between baseline ASR and freezing behavior following Pavlovian fear conditioning was examined in a group of adult, male Sprague-Dawley rats. Baseline acoustic startle response (ASR) was assessed preceding exposure to a Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigm where freezing behavior was measured during fear conditioning, extinction training, and extinction testing. Although there was no relationship between baseline ASR and fear memory following conditioning, rats with low baseline ASR had significantly lower magnitude of retention of the extinction memory than rats with high baseline ASR. The results suggest that baseline ASR has value as a predictive index of the development of a PTSD -like phenotype.

28132082|t|High tacrolimus blood concentrations early after lung transplantation and the risk of kidney injury
28132082|a|Lung transplant recipients often develop acute kidney injury (AKI) evolving into chronic kidney disease (CKD). The immunosuppressant tacrolimus might be associated with the emergence of AKI. We analyzed the development and recovery of kidney injury after lung transplantation and related AKI to whole-blood tacrolimus trough concentrations and other factors causing kidney injury. We retrospectively studied kidney injury in 186 lung-transplantation patients at the UMC Utrecht between 2001 and 2011. Kidney function and whole-blood tacrolimus trough concentrations were determined from day 1 to 14 and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperative. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), septic shock, and nephrotoxic medications were evaluated as covariates for AKI. We analyzed liver injury and drug-drug interactions. AKI was present in 85 (46%) patients. Tacrolimus concentrations were supra-therapeutic in 135 of 186 patients (73%). AKI in the first week after transplantation was related to supra-therapeutic tacrolimus concentrations (OR 1.55; 95% CI 1.06-2.27), ≥3 other nephrotoxic drugs (OR 1.96; 95% CI 1.02-3.77), infection (OR 2.48; 95% CI 1.31-4.70), and cystic fibrosis (OR 2.17; 95% CI 1.16-4.06). Recovery rate of AKI was lower than expected (19%), and the cumulative incidence of severe CKD at 1 year was 15%. After lung transplantation, AKI is common and often evolves into severe CKD, which is a known cause of morbidity and mortality. Supra-therapeutic whole-blood tacrolimus trough concentrations are related to the early onset of AKI. Conscientious targeting tacrolimus blood concentrations might be vital in the early phase after lung transplantation. What is known about this subject? • Lung transplant recipients often develop acute kidney injury evolving into chronic kidney disease increasing both morbidity and mortality. • To date, the pathophysiology of kidney injury after lung transplantation has not been fully elucidated. • The immunosuppressant tacrolimus is difficult to dose, especially in the unstable clinical setting, and is nephrotoxic. • For the first time, supra-therapeutic whole-blood tacrolimus trough concentrations are related to the emergence of acute kidney injury in the first days after lung transplantation. • Supra-therapeutic whole-blood tacrolimus trough concentrations often occur early after lung transplantation. • AKI after lung transplantation shows low recovery rates.

28132765|t|Zebrafish akt2 is essential for survival, growth, bone development, and glucose homeostasis
28132765|a|As one of three akt isoforms, akt2 plays a key role in the regulation of widely divergent cellular processes in mammals. However, its role and underlying mechanisms in zebrafish remain largely unknown. To elucidate the function of akt2 in zebrafish, we generated zebrafish lacking akt2 gene via CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Akt2 - null zebrafish exhibit partial lethality and severe growth deficiency, which is different from those observed in akt2 - null mice. Furthermore, akt2 - null zebrafish display deficiency in fin ray development, but their cartilage is not affected. Similar to observations in akt2 - null mice, akt2 - null zebrafish display impaired glucose homeostasis. However, in contrast to that in akt2 - null mice, insulin level is lower in akt2 - null zebrafish, implicating the symptoms of type I diabetes exhibited in akt2 - null zebrafish. In addition, transcriptome analysis reveals that the genes involved in metabolism and osteogenesis are disturbed in akt2 - null zebrafish. Taken together, these data not only support an important role of akt2 in zebrafish survival, growth, bone development and glucose homeostasis, but also suggest that akt2 has divergent functions between mice and zebrafish, even though they are evolutionarily conserved.

28132824|t|Physiological Properties and Behavioral Correlates of Hippocampal Granule Cells and Mossy Cells
28132824|a|The hippocampal dentate gyrus is often viewed as a segregator of upstream information. Physiological support for such function has been hampered by a lack of well-defined characteristics that can identify granule cells and mossy cells. We developed an electrophysiology -based classification of dentate granule cells and mossy cells in mice that we validated by optogenetic tagging of mossy cells. Granule cells exhibited sparse firing, had a single place field, and showed only modest changes when the mouse was tested in different mazes in the same room. In contrast, mossy cells were more active, had multiple place fields and showed stronger remapping of place fields under the same conditions. Although the granule cell - mossy cell synapse was strong and facilitating, mossy cells rarely "inherited" place fields from single granule cells. Our findings suggest that the granule cells and mossy cells could be modulated separately and their joint action may be critical for pattern separation.

28134415|t|A primer on intraosseous access: History, clinical considerations, and current devices
28134415|a|Intraosseous (IO) access is a method recommended by the American Heart Association and the European Resuscitation Council to administer resuscitative drugs and fluids when intravenous (IV) access cannot be rapidly or easily obtained. Many clinicians have limited knowledge or experience with the IO route. The purpose of this review was to provide the reader with a succinct review of the history, clinical considerations, and devices associated with IO access. Narrative review. University-based academic research cell. Not applicable. Not applicable. IO access is a lifesaving bridge to definitive vascular access that may be considered when an IV cannot be rapidly attained and the patient's outcome may be negatively affected without prompt circulatory access. The IO route has few contraindications for use and a low rate of serious complications. Multiple manual and powered devices that may be placed in several anatomic sites are commercially available. All clinicians who provide acute care or respond to cardiovascular emergencies should obtain training and maintain proficiency in placing and using IO devices as the IO route is recommended by the major resuscitation organizations as the preferred route of infusion when rapid, reliable IV access is unavailable.

28135997|t|Exposure to suicidal behaviors: A common suicide risk factor or a personal negative life event?
28135997|a|Numerous suicide risk factors have been proposed but not adequately validated for epidemiology, treatment and prevention efforts. Exposures to suicidal behaviors (ESB), from family and friend suicide attempts and completions, were tested for validity as a suicidal risk factor and also for measurement and construct adequacy. An anonymous online survey yielded 713 participants (aged 18-71), who reported ESB, completed the Suicidal Affect-Behavior-Cognition Scale (SABCS), and comprised a broad spectrum on those variables. Tests of dimensionality and internal consistency showed the four ESB variables (attempts / completions through family / friends) were independent and did not form a common factor or an identifiable ESB latent trait. ESB variables were, however, associated with demographic and psychiatric histories. A battery of tests revealed no meaningful associations between ESB and total suicidality or suicide risk factors (social support, depression, anxiety, stress, satisfaction with life and emotional stability). In addition, in contrast to previous reports, young adults (n = 200; aged 18-20) showed no increased suicidality due to ESB. Results showed no validity for ESB as a common risk factor for suicidality or other psychopathology, or as a latent trait. ESB showed evidence as a personal negative life event with individual effects and interpretations.

28137262|t|Direct anterior approach for total hip arthroplasty with a novel mobile traction table -a prospective cohort study
28137262|a|The purpose of this prospective cohort study was to clarify the safety and efficacy of total hip arthroplasty via the direct anterior approach in the supine position with a novel mobile traction table. The first experience of consecutive surgeries by a single surgeon using the direct anterior approach with a traction table is described with a two-year follow-up period. Of 121 patients, 100 patients without previous hip surgeries, severe deformity, or cemented implants were divided into two groups comprising the first 50 patients and the second 50 patients. The implant survival rate was 99% at the two-year follow-up. Revision surgery was required for periprosthetic femoral fracture in one patient. The complication rate possibly related to the traction table was 5% (5 patients): three anterior dislocations, one periprosthetic femoral fracture, and one intraoperative perforation caused by femoral rasping. The complication rate tended to decrease in the second group compared to the first group (4% versus 6%). Mean surgical time (72.0 minutes versus 82.5 min, p = 0.027), rate of allogeneic blood transfusion (2% versus 24%, p = 0.001), and cup alignment in the safe zone (100% versus 88%, p = 0.027) were significantly improved in the second group compared to the first group. The direct anterior approach with a novel mobile traction table showed a positive learning curve for surgical time, rate of allogeneic blood transfusion, and cup alignment in the safe zone.

28137449|t|The binding orientations of structurally -related ligands can differ; A cautionary note
28137449|a|Crystal structures can identify ligand-receptor interactions and assist the development of novel therapeutics, but experimental challenges sometimes necessitate the use of homologous proteins. Tropisetron is an orthosteric ligand at both 5-HT3 and α7 nACh receptors and its binding orientation has been determined in the structural homologue AChBP (pdbid: 2WNC). Co-crystallisation with a structurally -related ligand, granisetron, reveals an almost identical orientation (pdbid; 2YME). However, there is a >1000-fold difference in the affinity of tropisetron at 5-HT3 versus α7 nACh receptors, and α7 nACh receptors do not bind granisetron. These striking pharmacological differences prompt questions about which receptor the crystal structures most closely represent and whether the ligand orientations are correct. Here we probe the binding orientation of tropisetron and granisetron at 5-HT3 receptors by in silico modelling and docking, radioligand binding on cysteine - substituted 5-HT3 receptor mutants transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells, and synthetic modification of the ligands. For 15 of the 23 cysteine substitutions, the effects on tropisetron and granisetron were different. Structure-activity relationships on synthesised derivatives of both ligands were also consistent with different orientations, revealing that contrary to the crystallographic evidence from AChBP, the two ligands adopt different orientations in the 5-HT3 receptor binding site. Our results show that even quite structurally similar molecules can adopt different orientations in the same binding site, and that caution may be needed when using homologous proteins to predict ligand binding.

28139296|t|Lignans from the fruits of Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill inhibit proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 expression
28139296|a|Bioactivity-guided fractionation of the fruits of Schisandra chinensis, using the proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) mRNA expression screening assay, led to isolation of two previously unknown lignans, 14-tigloylschinlignan D and rel-(7R, 8R, 7'R, 8'R)-manglisin E, along with 28 known compounds. All structures were established by NMR spectroscopic data as well as CD and MS analysis. All isolates were tested for their inhibitory activities on the mRNA expression of PCSK9. Of the tested compounds, four of the compounds rel-(7R, 8R, 7'R, 8'R)-manglisin E, (-)-schisandrin C, schinlignan D, and (+)-schisandrol B potently inhibited PCSK9 mRNA expression with IC50 values of 3.15, 3.85, 0.36, and 1.10 μM, respectively. Furthermore, schinlignan D and (+)-schisandrol B were found to suppress PCSK9 protein expressions and schinlignan D deemed to increase low density lipoprotein receptor expression.

28139371|t|A comparison of outcomes in morbidly obese, obese and non-obese patients undergoing primary total knee and total hip arthroplasty
28139371|a|Obesity is a growing public health issue with the prevalence of morbid obesity, (Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥ 40 kg/m(2)) increasing. There is some evidence these patients have more peri- and post-operative complications and poorer outcomes when undergoing arthroplasty procedures. This audit aimed to determine and compare the outcomes of non-obese, obese and morbidly obese patients undergoing arthroplasty at our institution. This was a retrospective audit of patients from our institution who had undergone total knee (TKA) or total hip arthroplasty (THA) in 2009. Data collected were: age, gender, BMI, length of stay (LOS), Oxford knee or hip score (OKS / OHS), satisfaction and complications up to two years post operation. Patients were divided into three groups: BMI < 30, BMI 30-40 and BMI > 40. Outcomes for each BMI group were compared. 1014 TKA and 906 THA operations were included. When compared to obese and non-obese patients, morbidly obese patients undergoing TKA had a mean LOS one day longer, a mean OKS four points lower and higher rates of postoperative problems, 37% vs. 21%. For THA patients there was no difference in LOS, OHS score was two points lower for each increasing BMI category and postoperative problems increase from 25% for non-obese to 31% for obese and 38% for morbidly obese patients. These results will be useful in informing obese patients of their potential outcomes following TKA or THA. These patients can then make a more informed choice before proceeding with arthroplasty.

28139665|t|Vitamin D Receptor Activator Use and Cause-specific Death among dialysis Patients: a Nationwide Cohort Study using Coarsened Exact Matching
28139665|a|Vitamin D receptor activators (VDRA) may exert pleiotropic effects on cardiovascular disease, malignancy, and infections among dialysis patients, but recent studies have mainly focused on cardiovascular outcomes. Among 8,675 patients who started dialysis in 2007 and who survived until January 1, 2010, listed in the Renal Data Registry of the Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy, 5,365 VDRA users were matched to 3,203 non-users based on clinically relevant variables at the end of 2009 using the coarsened exact matching procedure. Until December 31, 2011, a total of 1,128 deaths occurred, of which 468 (42%) were cardiovascular deaths, 229 (20%) were infection-related deaths, and 141 (12%) were malignancy-related deaths. Multivariable survival analyses accounting for intra-region correlation revealed that VDRA use was significantly associated with lower rates of infection - and malignancy -related deaths [subhazard ratio 0.62 (95% CI, 0.52-0.73) and 0.70 (95% CI, 0.50-0.97), respectively] but not with cardiovascular death [subhazard ratio 0.86 (95% CI, 0.72-1.04)]. Future randomized clinical trials with a sufficient sample size and an adequate follow-up period are warranted to test the clinical effectiveness of VDRA on infection and malignancy, rather than cardiovascular disease, among dialysis patients.

28144096|t|Burden of cervical cancer and role of screening in India
28144096|a|Cervical cancer is a major cause of cancer mortality in women and more than a quarter of its global burden is contributed by developing countries. In India, in spite of alarmingly high figures, there is no nationwide government-sponsored screening program. This study was conducted to assess the burden of cervical cancer in India and review the performance characteristics of available cervical cancer screening tools, so as to provide evidence -based recommendations for application of most practically suited screening test to be used in resource -poor field settings. MEDLINE and Web of Science electronic database were searched from January 1990 to December 2015, using the keywords such as " cervical cancer ", " screening ", " early detection ", " cervical cytology " and " visual inspection ", and their corresponding MeSH terms in combination with Boolean operators "OR, AND." Two authors independently selected studies that are published in English and conducted in India. A total of 11 studies were found to be relevant and eligible to be included in the present study. In India, cervical cancer contributes to approximately 6-29% of all cancers in women. The age-adjusted incidence rate of cervical cancer varies widely among registries; highest is 23.07/100,000 in Mizoram state and the lowest is 4.91/100,000 in Dibrugarh district. The pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity of visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), magnified VIA, visual inspection with Lugol's iodine (VILI), cytology (Pap smear), and human papillomavirus DNA were found to be 67.65% and 84.32%, 65.36% and 85.76%, 78.27% and 87.10%, 62.11% and 93.51%, and 77.81% and 91.54%, respectively. In developing countries because of lack of necessary infrastructure and quality control, high-quality cytology screening may not be feasible for wide-scale implementation. Hence, cervical cancer screening program based on visual screening test such as VIA / VILI should be adopted as an integral part of primary health-care setup in resource - poor countries like India.

28144564|t|Structural and tribometric characterization of biomimetically inspired synthetic " insect adhesives "
28144564|a|Background: Based on previous chemical analyses of insect tarsal adhesives, we prepared 12 heterogeneous synthetic emulsions mimicking the polar/non-polar principle, analysed their microscopical structure and tested their adhesive, frictional, and rheological properties. Results: The prepared emulsions varied in their consistency from solid rubber-like, over soft elastic, to fluid (watery or oily). With droplet sizes >100 nm, all the emulsions belonged to the common type of macroemulsions. The emulsions of the first generation generally showed broader droplet-size ranges compared with the second generation, especially when less defined components such as petrolatum or waxes were present in the lipophilic fraction of the first generation of emulsions. Some of the prepared emulsions showed a yield point and were Bingham fluids. Tribometric adhesion was tested via probe tack tests. Compared with the " second generation " (containing less viscous components), the " first generation " emulsions were much more adhesive (31-93 mN), a finding attributable to their highly viscous components, i.e., wax, petrolatum, gelatin and poly(vinyl alcohol). In the second generation emulsions, we attained much lower adhesivenesses, ranging between 1-18 mN. The adhesive performance was drastically reduced in the emulsions that contained albumin as the protein component or that lacked protein. Tribometric shear tests were performed at moderate normal loads. Our measured friction forces (4-93 mN in the first and 0.1-5.8 mN in the second generation emulsions) were comparatively low. Differences in shear performance were related to the chemical composition and emulsion structure. Conclusion: By varying their chemical composition, synthetic heterogeneous adhesive emulsions can be adjusted to have diverse consistencies and are able to mimic certain rheological and tribological properties of natural tarsal insect adhesives.

28150322|t|Three-Dimensional HyCoSy With Perfluoropropane-Albumin Microspheres as Contrast Agents and Normal Saline Injections Into the Pelvic Cavity for Morphological Assessment of the Fallopian Tube in Infertile Women
28150322|a|To apply the three-dimensional (3D) hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography (HyCoSy) with perfluoropropane-albumin microspheres as contrast agents and normal saline injections into the pelvic cavity for assessment of the tubal patency and adhesions of fimbrial parts. Fifty-five infertile female patients were recruited to undergo 3D HyCoSy with normal saline injected into the pelvic cavity, in which the tubal patency was observed by visualizing the spillage of contrast agents from the fimbriae, and the fimbrial adhesion was confirmed by the finger-like projections of the fimbriae and their floating and moving status. Of the 55 patients, bilateral tubal patency was observed in 44 (80.0%), unilateral tubal patency and the other partial occlusion in 7 (12.7%), unilateral partial occlusion and the other complete occlusion in 3 (5.4%), and bilateral complete occlusion in 1 (1.8%). The fimbrial parts were observed in 105 fallopian tubes, among which 101 were seen with the finger-like fimbriae floated and moved in the pelvic cavity, whereas 4 tubes were not because of adhesion to the pelvic cavity (n = 3) or the ovary and intestine (n = 1). More than three visible, quite long, and distributed evenly finger-like projection s were present for the patent fimbrial parts; however, fewer, flat, and not evenly distributed finger-like projection s were present for the adhesive tubes. No serious complications occurred during or after this procedure. Combination of 3D HyCoSy with normal saline injected into the pelvic cavity may be a feasible and safe procedure to assess tubal patency and adhesions of the fimbrial parts.

28150378|t|Challenging some assumptions about empathy
28150378|a|In New Zealand little nursing or medical curricula time, if any, is specifically devoted to the enhancement of empathy. If being empathic is important in the context of patient care, it is a quality that is already present in students or is learned by students during their practicum in the company of experienced clinicians. This study aimed to compare self-reported empathy ratings between different groups of medical students and one cohort of nursing students who were either exposed or not exposed to explicit empathy training or learning in clinical settings in the presence of patients. The Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (JSPE) was completed before and after groups of medical and nursing students had been exposed to various extended periods of practicum. Some medical student cohorts undertook brief empathy training, whereas others had no exposure. The nursing student cohort had no formal, explicit empathy training. Irrespective of profession, length of practicum or exposure to specific empathy training, there were no significant differences in the self-reported JSPE scores across the seven different cohorts of students. Empathy is a quality that is already present in students or is learned by students during their practicum DISCUSSION: If empathy is caught rather than taught, then brief efforts to enhance empathy may be futile. To optimise the inherent empathic qualities of aspirant health professionals, explicit consideration should be given to how empathy is influenced by the practicum experience.

28155918|t|Surface mediated cooperative interactions of drugs enhance mechanical forces for antibiotic action
28155918|a|The alarming increase of pathogenic bacteria that are resistant to multiple antibiotics is now recognized as a major health issue fuelling demand for new drugs. Bacterial resistance is often caused by molecular changes at the bacterial surface, which alter the nature of specific drug-target interactions. Here, we identify a novel mechanism by which drug-target interactions in resistant bacteria can be enhanced. We examined the surface forces generated by four antibiotics; vancomycin, ristomycin, chloroeremomycin and oritavancin against drug-susceptible and drug-resistant targets on a cantilever and demonstrated significant differences in mechanical response when drug-resistant targets are challenged with different antibiotics although no significant differences were observed when using susceptible targets. Remarkably, the binding affinity for oritavancin against drug-resistant targets (70 nM) was found to be 11,000 times stronger than for vancomycin (800 μM), a powerful antibiotic used as the last resort treatment for streptococcal and staphylococcal bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Using an exactly solvable model, which takes into account the solvent and membrane effects, we demonstrate that drug-target interactions are strengthened by pronounced polyvalent interactions catalyzed by the surface itself. These findings further enhance our understanding of antibiotic mode of action and will enable development of more effective therapies.

28162781|t|Intra-articular corticosteroids versus intra-articular corticosteroids plus methotrexate in oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis: a multicentre, prospective, randomised, open-label trial
28162781|a|Little evidence-based information is available to guide the treatment of oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. We aimed to investigate whether oral methotrexate increases the efficacy of intra-articular corticosteroid therapy. We did this prospective, open-label, randomised trial at ten hospitals in Italy. Using a concealed computer-generated list, children younger than 18 years with oligoarticular - onset disease were randomly assigned (1:1) to intra-articular corticosteroids alone or in combination with oral methotrexate (15 mg/m(2); maximum 20 mg). Corticosteroids used were triamcinolone hexacetonide (shoulder, elbow, wrist, knee, and tibiotalar joints) or methylprednisolone acetate (ie, subtalar and tarsal joints). We did not mask patients or investigators to treatment assignments. Our primary outcome was the proportion of patients in the intention-to-treat population who had remission of arthritis in all injected joints at 12 months. This trial is registered with European Union Clinical Trials Register, EudraCT number 2008-006741-70. Between July 7, 2009, and March 31, 2013, we screened 226 participants and randomly assigned 102 to intra-articular corticosteroids alone and 105 to intra-articular corticosteroids plus methotrexate. 33 (32%) patients assigned to intra-articular corticosteroids alone and 39 (37%) assigned to intra-articular corticosteroids and methotrexate therapy had remission of arthritis in all injected joints (p=0·48). Adverse events were recorded for 20 (17%) patients who received methotrexate, which led to permanent treatment discontinuation in two patients (one due to increased liver transaminases and one due to gastrointestinal discomfort). No patient had a serious adverse event. Concomitant administration of methotrexate did not augment the effectiveness of intra-articular corticosteroid therapy. Future studies are needed to define the optimal therapeutic strategies for oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Italian Agency of Drug Evaluation.

28164568|t|Methylation Analysis of BRCA1 and APC in Breast Cancer and It's Relationship to Clinicopathological Features
28164568|a|Promoter methylation of tumor suppressor genes is an important epigenetic alteration that occurs in the primary stages of human tumors, including breast cancer. Identification of methylated genes and their relationship to clinical features can contribute to the prognosis and early detection of tumors. In this study, we explored the methylation status of APC and BRCA1 genes and their relationship to clinical factors in breast cancer patients. BRCA1 and APC promoter methylation was examined by methylation - specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA) assay in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) breast tissue from 75 patients. APC promoter methylation was detected in 30.67% breast cancer tissues and BRCA1 was methylated in 9.33% of breast tumors. Methylation of APC was associated with low histological grade (p = 0.006) and methylation of BRCA1 was related with lymph node metastasis (p = 0.017). These findings suggest that the methylation status of APC and BRCA1 can be a predictive marker for early detection and better management of breast cancer patients.

28166607|t|Recombinant fibrinogen reveals the differential roles of α- and γ-chain cross-linking and molecular heterogeneity in fibrin clot strain-stiffening
28166607|a|Essentials Fibrinogen circulates in human plasma as a complex mixture of heterogeneous molecular variants. We measured strain-stiffening of recombinantly produced fibrinogen upon clotting. Factor XIII and molecular heterogeneity alter clot elasticity at the protofibril and fiber level. This highlights the hitherto unknown role of molecular composition in fibrin clot mechanics. Background Fibrin plays a crucial role in haemostasis and wound healing by forming strain-stiffening fibrous networks that reinforce blood clots. The molecular origin of fibrin's strain-stiffening behavior remains poorly understood, primarily because plasma fibrinogen is a complex mixture of heterogeneous molecular variants and is often contaminated by plasma factors that affect clot properties. Objectives and methods To facilitate mechanistic dissection of fibrin nonlinear elasticity, we produced a homogeneous recombinant fibrinogen corresponding to the main variant in human plasma, termed rFib610. We characterized the structure of rFib610 clots using turbidimetry, microscopy and X-ray scattering. We used rheology to measure the strain-stiffening behavior of the clots and determined the fiber properties by modeling the clots as semi-flexible polymer networks. Results We show that addition of FXIII to rFib610 clots causes a dose-dependent stiffness increase at small deformations and renders the strain-stiffening response reversible. We find that γ-chain cross-linking contributes to clot elasticity by changing the force-extension behavior of the protofibrils, whereas α-chain cross-linking stiffens the fibers, as a consequence of tighter coupling between the constituent protofibrils. Interestingly, rFib610 protofibrils have a 25% larger bending rigidity than plasma -purified fibrin protofibrils and a delayed strain-stiffening, indicating that molecular heterogeneity influences clot mechanics at the protofibril scale. Conclusions Fibrinogen molecular heterogeneity and FXIII affect the mechanical function of fibrin clots by altering the nonlinear viscoelastic properties at the protofibril and fiber scale. This work provides a starting point to investigate the role of molecular heterogeneity of plasma fibrinogen in fibrin clot mechanics and haemostasis.

28166877|t|Effects of display curvature, display zone, and task duration on legibility and visual fatigue during visual search task
28166877|a|This study examined the effects of display curvature (400, 600, 1200 mm, and flat), display zone (5 zones), and task duration (15 and 30 min) on legibility and visual fatigue. Each participant completed two 15-min visual search task sets at each curvature setting. The 600-mm and 1200-mm settings yielded better results than the flat setting in terms of legibility and perceived visual fatigue. Relative to the corresponding centre zone, the outermost zones of the 1200-mm and flat settings showed a decrease of 8%-37% in legibility, whereas those of the flat setting showed an increase of 26%-45% in perceived visual fatigue. Across curvature s, legibility decreased by 2%-8%, whereas perceived visual fatigue increased by 22% during the second task set. The two task sets induced an increase of 102% in the eye complaint score and a decrease of 0.3 Hz in the critical fusion frequency, both of which indicated an increase in visual fatigue. In summary, a curvature of around 600 mm, central display zones, and frequent breaks are recommended to improve legibility and reduce visual fatigue.

28171696|t|Predicting changes in adaptive functioning and behavioral adjustment following treatment for a pediatric brain tumor: A report from the Brain Radiation Investigative Study Consortium
28171696|a|Children are at risk for behavioral and adaptive difficulties following pediatric brain tumor. This study explored whether familial / demographic, developmental, diagnostic, or treatment -related variables best predict posttreatment behavioral and adaptive functioning. Participants included 40 children (mean age = 12.76 years, SD = 4.01) posttreatment (mean time since diagnosis = 1.99 years, SD = 0.21) for pediatric brain tumor. Parents rated children 's behavioral adjustment and adaptive functioning and provided demographic and developmental histories. Diagnostic and treatment -related information was abstracted from medical records. Ratings of adaptive and behavioral functioning approximately 2 years postdiagnosis were within the average range, although the percentage of children exceeding clinical cutoffs for impairment in adaptive skills exceeded expectation, particularly practical skills. Premorbid behavior problems and tumor size predicted posttreatment adaptive functioning. After accounting for adaptive functioning near diagnosis, premorbid behavior problems predicted declines in adaptive functioning 2 years postdiagnosis. After accounting for adjustment near diagnosis, no variables predicted declines in behavioral adjustment. Children may be vulnerable to reduced adaptive functioning following pediatric brain tumor treatment, especially in practical skills. Assessing prediagnosis functioning and diagnostic and treatment -related variables may improve our ability to predict those at greatest risk, although those factors may be less helpful in identifying children likely to develop behavioral difficulties. Screening of these factors in tertiary care and long-term follow-up settings may improve identification of those at greatest need for support services.

28175980|t|Spine fracture prevalence in a nationally representative sample of US women and men aged ≥40 years: results from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2013-2014
28175980|a|Spine fracture prevalence is similar in men and women, increasing from <5 % in those <60 to 11 % in those 70-79 and 18 % in those ≥80 years. Prevalence was higher with age, lower bone mineral density (BMD), and in those meeting criteria for spine imaging. Most subjects with spine fractures were unaware of them. Spine fractures have substantial medical significance but are seldom recognized. This study collected contemporary nationally representative spine fracture prevalence data. Cross-sectional analysis of 3330 US adults aged ≥40 years participating in NHANES 2013-2014 with evaluable Vertebral Fracture Assessment (VFA). VFA was graded by semiquantitative measurement. BMD and an osteoporosis questionnaire were collected. Overall spine fracture prevalence was 5.4 % and similar in men and women. Prevalence increased with age from <5 % in those <60 to 11 % in those 70-79 and 18 % in those ≥80 years. Fractures were more common in non-Hispanic whites and in people with lower body mass index and BMD. Among subjects with spine fracture, 26 % met BMD criteria for osteoporosis. Prevalence was higher in subjects who met National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) criteria for spine imaging (14 vs 4.7 %, P < 0.001). Only 8 % of people with a spine fracture diagnosed by VFA had a self-reported fracture, and among those who self-reported a spine fracture, only 21 % were diagnosed with fracture by VFA. Spine fracture prevalence is similar in women and men and increases with age and lower BMD, although most subjects with spine fracture do not meet BMD criteria for osteoporosis. Since most (>90 %) individuals were unaware of their spine fractures, lateral spine imaging is needed to identify these women and men. Spine fracture prevalence was threefold higher in individuals meeting NOF criteria for spine imaging (∼1 in 7 undergoing VFA). Identifying spine fractures as part of comprehensive risk assessment may improve clinical decision making.

28179308|t|Renieramycin M Attenuates Cancer Stem Cell -like Phenotypes in H460 Lung Cancer Cells
28179308|a|Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a subpopulation of cancer cells that possess self-renewal and differentiation capacities. CSCs contribute to drug-resistance, cancer recurrence and metastasis, thus development of CSC -targeted therapeutic strategies has recently received significant attention in cancer research. In this study, the potential efficacy of renieramycin M (RM) isolated from the sponge Xestospongia species, was examined against lung CSCs. Colony and spheroid formation assays, as well as western blotting analysis of lung CSC protein markers were employed to determine the CSC -like phenotypes of H460 lung cancer cells after treatment with RM at non-toxic concentrations. RM treatment reduced significantly colony and spheroid formation of H460 cells. Moreover, the CSC markers CD133, CD44 and ALDH1A1 of CSC -enriched H460 cells were reduced significantly following RM treatment. RM could be a potent anti-metastatic agent by suppressing lung CSC -like phenotypes in H460 cells.

28181464|t|Physicochemical characterization of chitosan - hyaluronan -coated solid lipid nanoparticles for the targeted delivery of paclitaxel: a proof-of-concept study in breast cancer cells
28181464|a|To investigate the potential of modified solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) for the delivery of paclitaxel (PAX). SLN loaded with PAX were prepared via modified high-pressure hot homogenization. Formulation parameters were optimized to obtain a high-quality delivery system. SLN cores were coated, layer-by-layer, with a chitosan and hyaluronan (HA) shell. Selectivity toward HA receptors was tested in a breast cancer cell line, MCF-7. Stable and reproducible nano-sized and negatively charged nanoparticles resulted. Findings reveal that chitosan - HA -coated SLN facilitated the targeting, cellular uptake and the time-/dose-controlled delivery and release of PAX, enhancing intrinsic chemotherapeutic activities. SLN are suitable carrier candidates for nano-oncology given their localized, and potent cytotoxic potential overcoming multidrug-resistant cancer cells.

28181538|t|Epigenetic Editing of Ascl1 Gene in Neural Stem Cells by Optogenetics
28181538|a|Enzymes involved in epigenetic processes such as methyltransferases or demethylases are becoming highly utilized for their persistent DNA or histone modifying efficacy. Herein, we have developed an optogenetic toolbox fused to the catalytic domain (CD) of DNA-methyltransferase3A (DNMT3A - CD) or Ten-Eleven Dioxygenase-1 (TET1 - CD) for loci - specific alteration of the methylation state at the promoter of Ascl1 (Mash1), a candidate proneuron gene. Optogenetical protein pairs, CRY2 linked to DNMT3A - CD or TET1 - CD and CIB1 fused to a Transcription Activator-Like Element (TALE) locating an Ascl1 promoter region, were designed for site specific epigenetic editing. A differentially methylated region at the Ascl1 promoter, isolated from murine dorsal root ganglion (hypermethylated) and striated cells (hypomethylated), was targeted with these optogenetic-epigenetic constructs. Optimized blue-light illumination triggered the co-localization of TALE constructs with DNMT3A - CD or TET1 - CD fusion proteins at the targeted site of the Ascl1 promoter. We found that this spatiotemporal association of the fusion proteins selectively alters the methylation state and also regulates gene activity. This proof of concept developed herein holds immense promise for the ability to regulate gene activity via epigenetic modulation with spatiotemporal precision.

28182076|t|Vaginal Infections of Albanian women Infected with HPV and their impact in intraepithelial cervical lesions evidenced by Pap test
28182076|a|Cervical cytology is the best single method for large screening of the population in identifying precancerous lesions of the uterine cervix. To estimate the frequency of human papillomavirus (HPV) positivity in a group of Albanian women, the prevalence of vaginal coinfections, and the relationship of coinfections with HPV, as well as their role in metaplasia or cervical intraepithelial lesions (CIN). In this retrospective study, 2075 vaginal smears were examined. The Papanicolaou stain was used for all slides. The New Bethesda System 2001 was used for the interpretations of the smears. Data analysis was completed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 19.0. Prevalence of HPV positivity was 43.9% with an average age of 35.48 ± 9.27 years. Candida coinfection resulted in 57.8% of HPV positive women with a significant relationship between them. Gardnerella coinfection resulted in 36 (23%), mixed flora in 34 (8%), and Trichomonas vaginalis in 50% of HPV positive woman. Among the women with positive HPV, 19% had CIN, 8% had metaplasia, and 1% had metaplasia and CIN; 9% of the women with HPV had CIN1 and one of the coinfections. There is a strong relationship between CIN1 and HPV positivity as well as between CIN1 and coinfections. HPV infection is a major factor contributing to metaplasia, and bacterial coinfections in HPV positive women have a statistically significant impact in the development of metaplasia.

28182129|t|A Case of Acute Hepatitis E Infection in a Patient with Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treated Successfully with Ribavirin
28182129|a|We present the case of a man who, following immunosuppressive treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, became infected with viral hepatitis E. Acute hepatitis E virus infection should be considered in patients with deranged liver function on a background of haematological malignancies or immunosuppression, even without travel to endemic regions. Whilst clearance is usually spontaneous in immune - competent individuals, these at-risk groups may develop a more complicated and protracted disease course. Thus awareness is important as additional treatment with ribavirin or pegylated interferon may be required, as in this case, in order to help achieve eradication.

28183806|t|Commissioning through competition and cooperation in the English NHS under the Health and Social Care Act 2012: evidence from a qualitative study of four clinical commissioning groups
28183806|a|The Health and Social Care Act 2012 (' HSCA 2012 ') introduced a new, statutory, form of regulation of competition into the National Health Service (NHS), while at the same time recognising that cooperation was necessary. NHS England's policy document, The Five Year Forward View (' 5YFV ') of 2014 placed less emphasis on competition without altering the legislation. We explored how commissioners and providers understand the complex regulatory framework, and how they behave in relation to competition and cooperation. We carried out detailed case studies in four clinical commissioning groups, using interviews and documentary analysis to explore the commissioners ' and providers ' understanding and experience of competition and cooperation. We conducted 42 interviews with senior managers in commissioning organisations and senior managers in NHS and independent provider organisations (acute and community services). Neither commissioners nor providers fully understand the regulatory regime in respect of competition in the NHS, and have not found that the regulatory authorities have provided adequate guidance. Despite the HSCA 2012 promoting competition, commissioners chose mainly to use collaborative strategies to effect major service reconfigurations, which is endorsed as a suitable approach by providers. Nevertheless, commissioners are using competitive tendering in respect of more peripheral services in order to improve quality of care and value for money. Commissioners regard the use of competition and cooperation as appropriate in the NHS currently, although collaborative strategies appear more helpful in respect of large-scale changes. However, the current regulatory framework contained in the HSCA 2012, particularly since the publication of the 5YFV, is not clear. Better guidance should be issued by the regulatory authorities.

28187247|t|Prevalence and correlates of antibiotic sharing in the Philippines: antibiotic misconceptions and community - level access to non-medical sources of antibiotics
28187247|a|To identify sociodemographic, knowledge and attitudinal correlates to antibiotic sharing among a community-based sample of adults (age 18 and older) in a low-income setting of the Philippines and to explore community - level data on informal antibiotic distribution in roadside stands (i.e., sari-sari stands). Participants (n = 307) completed self-administered surveys. Correlates to antibiotic sharing were assessed using logistic regression with Firth's bias-adjusted estimate s. Study staff also visited 106 roadside stands and collected data on availability and characteristics of antibiotics in the stands. 78% had shared antibiotics in their lifetime, most often with family members. In multivariable analysis, agreement with the belief that it is safe to prematurely stop an antibiotic course (OR: 2.8, CI: 1.3-5.8) and concerns about antibiotic side effects (OR: 2.1, CI: 1.1-4.4) were significantly associated with increased odds of reported antibiotic sharing. Antibiotic sharing was not associated with sociodemographic characteristics or antibiotic knowledge. Antibiotics were widely available in 60% of sampled sari-sari stands, in which 59% of antibiotics were missing expiration dates. Amoxicillin and cephalexin were the most commonly available antibiotics for sale at the stands (60% and 21%, respectively). Antibiotic sharing was common and was associated with misconceptions about proper antibiotic use. Antibiotics were widely available in sari-sari stands, and usually without expiration information. This study suggests that multipronged and locally tailored approaches to curbing informal antibiotic access are needed in the Philippines and similar Southeast-Asian countries.

28187885|t|Automated characterization and counting of Ki-67 protein for breast cancer prognosis: A quantitative immunohistochemistry approach
28187885|a|Ki-67 protein expression plays an important role in predicting the proliferative status of tumour cell s and deciding the future course of therapy in breast cancer. Immunohistochemical (IHC) determination of Ki-67 score or labelling index, by estimating the fraction of Ki67 positively stained tumour cells, is the most widely practiced method to assess tumour proliferation (Dowsett et al. 2011). Accurate manual counting of these cells (specifically nuclei) due to complex and dense distribution of cells, therefore, becomes critical and presents a major challenge to pathologists. In this paper, we suggest a hybrid clustering algorithm to quantify the proliferative index of breast cancer cells based on automated counting of Ki-67 nuclei. The proposed methodology initially pre-processes the IHC images of Ki-67 stained slides of breast cancer. The RGB images are converted to grey, L*a*b*, HSI, YCbCr, YIQ and XYZ colour space. All the stained cells are then characterized by two stage segmentation process. Fuzzy C-means quantifies all the stained cells as one cluster. The blue channel of the first stage output is given as input to k-means algorithm, which provides separate cluster for Ki-67 positive and negative cells. The count of positive and negative nuclei is used to calculate the F-measure for each colour space. A comparative study of our work with the expert opinion is studied to evaluate the error rate. The positive and negative nuclei detection results for all colour space s are compared with the ground truth for validation and F-measure is calculated. The F-measure for L*a*b* colour space (0.8847) provides the best statistical result as compared to grey, HSI, YCbCr, YIQ and XYZ colour space. Further, a study is carried out to count nuclei manually and automatically from the proposed algorithm with an average error rate of 6.84% which is significant. The study provides an automated count of positive and negative nuclei using L*a*b* colour space and hybrid segmentation technique. Computerized evaluation of proliferation index can aid pathologist in assessing breast cancer severity. The proposed methodology, further, has the potential advantage of saving time and assisting in decision making over the present manual procedure and could evolve as an assistive pathological decision support system.

28189069|t|Multitarget sensing of glucose and cholesterol based on Janus hydrogel microparticles
28189069|a|A visualized sensing method for glucose and cholesterol was developed based on the hemispheres of the same Janus hydrogel microparticles. Single-phase and Janus hydrogel microparticles were both generated using a centrifugal microfluidic chip. For glucose sensing, concanavalin A and fluorescein labeled dextran used for competitive binding assay were encapsulated in alginate microparticles, and the fluorescence of the microparticles was positively correlated with glucose concentration. For cholesterol sensing, the microparticles embedded with γ-Fe2O3 nanoparticles were used as catalyst for the oxidation of 3,3',5,5'-Tetramethylbenzidine by H2O2, an enzymatic hydrolysis product of cholesterol. And the color transition was more sensitive in the microparticles than in solutions, indicating the microparticles are more applicable for visualized determination. Furthermore, Janus microparticles were employed for multitarget sensing in the two hemespheres, and glucose and cholesterol were detected within the same microparticles without obvious interference. Besides, the particles could be manipulated by an external magnetic field. The glucose and cholesterol levels were measured in human serum utilizing the microparticles, which confirmed the potential application of the microparticles in real sample detection.

28190392|t|PI3K / Akt pathway: a potential therapeutic target for chronic pain
28190392|a|Chronic pain is among the most disabling and costly disorders, with prevalence ranging from 10% to 55%. However, current therapeutic strategies for chronic pain are unsatisfactory due to our poor understanding of its mechanisms. Thus, novel therapeutic targets need to be found in order to improve these patients' quality of life. PI3K and its downstream Akt are widely expressed in the spinal cord, particularly in the laminae I-IV of the dorsal horn, where nociceptive C and Aδ fibers of primary afferents principally terminate. Recent studies have demonstrated their critical roles in the development and maintenance of chronic pain. In this review, we summarized the roles and mechanisms of PI3K / Akt pathway in the progression of chronic pain through sciatic nerve injury, diabetic neuropathy, spinal cord injury, bone cancer, opioid tolerance, or opioid - induced hyperalgesia.

28190791|t|No free bed with ventilator: experience of a public health specialist
28190791|a|While the author was dealing with a poor elderly father struggling to shift his gravely injured young son to a government hospital due to the high cost of intensive care, her friends across the globe were discussing euthanasia in the social media. While marginalised groups of people are struggling to access care in India, friends who have moved to developed parts of the world were discussing one's choice to live or die ! The poor father, after battling to save his son and reaching out to many people for help, could not save him. Early treatment might have helped the young boy. The incident left the author thinking about how the poor are denied care simply because they cannot afford it. Others debate when to pull the plug on the patient. … How many families can afford such care in India? When nearly 71% of the people are paying out of pocket for healthcare and 16% are pushed below the poverty line every year, can we even think of universal health coverage? It just sounds like a fancy term to be used at conferences and meetings because the ground reality is completely different.

28192718|t|Quantitative determination of five metabolites of aspirin by UHPLC-MS / MS coupled with enzymatic reaction and its application to evaluate the effects of aspirin dosage on the metabolic profile
28192718|a|Acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin, ASA) is a famous drug for cardiovascular diseases in recent years. Effects of ASA dosage on the metabolic profile have not been fully understood. The purpose of our study is to establish a rapid and reliable method to quantify ASA metabolites in biological matrices, especially for glucuronide metabolites whose standards are not commercially available. Then we applied this method to evaluate the effects of ASA dosage on the metabolic and excretion profile of ASA metabolites in rat urine. Salicylic acid (SA), gentisic acid (GA) and salicyluric acid (SUA) were determined directly by UHPLC-MS / MS, while salicyl phenolic glucuronide (SAPG) and salicyluric acid phenolic glucuronide (SUAPG) were quantified indirectly by measuring the released SA and SUA from SAPG and SUAPG after β-glucuronidase digestion. SUA and SUAPG were the major metabolites of ASA in rat urine 24 h after ASA administration, which accounted for 50% (SUA) and 26% (SUAPG). When ASA dosage was increased, the contributions dropped to 32% and 18%, respectively. The excretion of other three metabolites (GA, SA and SAPG) however showed remarkable increases by 16%, 6% and 4%, respectively. In addition, SUA and SUAPG were mainly excreted in the time period of 12-24 h, while GA was excreted in the earlier time periods (0-4 h and 4-8 h). SA was mainly excreted in the time period of 0-4 h and 12-24 h. And the excretion of SAPG was equally distributed in the four time periods. We went further to show that the excretion of five metabolites in rat urine was delayed when ASA dosage was increased. In conclusion, we have developed a rapid and sensitive method to determine the five ASA metabolites (SA, GA, SUA, SAPG and SUAPG) in rat urine. We showed that ASA dosage could significantly influence the metabolic and excretion profile of ASA metabolites in rat urine.

28193730|t|Mismatch Repair Incompatibilities in Diverse Yeast Populations
28193730|a|An elevated mutation rate can provide cells with a source of mutations to adapt to changing environments. We identified a negative epistatic interaction involving naturally occurring variants in the MLH1 and PMS1 mismatch repair (MMR) genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae We hypothesized that this MMR incompatibility, created through mating between divergent S. cerevisiae, yields mutator progeny that can rapidly but transiently adapt to an environmental stress. Here we analyzed the MLH1 and PMS1 genes across 1010 S. cerevisiae natural isolates spanning a wide range of ecological sources (tree exudates, Drosophila, fruits, and various fermentation and clinical isolates) and geographical sources (Europe, America, Africa, and Asia). We identified one homozygous clinical isolate and 18 heterozygous isolates containing the incompatible MMR genotype. The MLH1 - PMS1 gene combination isolated from the homozygous clinical isolate conferred a mutator phenotype when expressed in the S288c laboratory background. Using a novel reporter to measure mutation rates, we showed that the overall mutation rate in the homozygous incompatible background was similar to that seen in compatible strains, indicating the presence of suppressor mutations in the clinical isolate that lowered its mutation rate. This observation and the identification of 18 heterozygous isolates, which can lead to MMR incompatible genotypes in the offspring, are consistent with an elevated mutation rate rapidly but transiently facilitating adaptation. To avoid long-term fitness costs, the incompatibility is apparently buffered by mating or by acquiring suppressors. These observations highlight effective strategies in eukaryotes to avoid long-term fitness costs associated with elevated mutation rates.

28203094|t|Mapping circulating serum miRNAs to their immune - related target mRNAs
28203094|a|Evidence suggests that circulating serum microRNAs (miRNAs) might preferentially target immune - related mRNAs. If this were the case, we hypothesized that immune - related mRNAs would have more predicted serum miRNA binding sites than other mRNAs and, reciprocally, that serum miRNAs would have more immune - related mRNA targets than non - serum miRNAs. We developed a consensus target predictor using the random forest framework and calculated the number of predicted miRNA - mRNA interactions in various subsets of miRNAs (serum, non - serum) and mRNAs (immune related, nonimmune related). Immune - related mRNAs were predicted to be targeted by serum miRNA more than other mRNAs. Moreover, serum miRNAs were predicted to target many more immune - related mRNA targets than non - serum miRNAs; however, these two biases in immune - related mRNAs and serum miRNAs appear to be completely independent. Immune - related mRNAs have more miRNA binding sites in general, not just for serum miRNAs; likewise, serum miRNAs target many more mRNAs than non - serum miRNAs overall, regardless of whether they are immune related or not. Nevertheless, these two independent phenomena result in a significantly larger number of predicted serum miRNA - immune mRNA interactions than would be expected by chance.

28205317|t|Oxidative stress and immunosenescence in spleen of obese mice can be reversed by 2-hydroxyoleic acid
28205317|a|We aimed to investigate the effects of obesity on oxidative stress and leukocyte function in spleen of mice, and to assess whether supplementation with 2-hydroxyoleic acid (2-OHOA) or n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) could reverse those effects. Female ICR/CD1 mice (8 weeks old, n = 24) received an obesogenic diet (22% fat for 4 weeks and 60% fat for 14 weeks). After 6 weeks, mice were split in three groups (n = 8/ group): no supplementation, 2-OHOA supplementation (1500 mg kg(-1)) and n-3 PUFA supplementation (EPA + DHA, 3000 mg kg(-1) diet). Eight mice were fed standard diet for the whole duration of the study (control group). At the end of the experiment, the following variables were assessed in spleens: levels of reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione, GSH / GSSG, xanthine oxidase (XO) activity, lipid peroxidation, lymphocyte chemotaxis, natural killer (NK) activity and mitogen (ConA and LPS)-induced lymphocyte proliferation. Obese animals presented higher GSSG levels (P = 0.003), GSSG / GSH ratio (P = 0.013), lipid peroxidation (P = 0.004), XO activity (P = 0.015) and lymphocyte chemotaxis (P < 0.001), and lower NK activity (P = 0.003) and proliferation in response to ConA (P < 0.001) than controls. 2-OHOA reversed totally or partially most of the changes (body weight, fat content, GSSG levels, GSH / GSSG, lipid peroxidation, chemotaxis and proliferation, all P < 0.05), while n-3 PUFA reversed the increase in XO activity (P = 0.032). In conclusion, 2-OHOA, and to a lesser extent n-3 PUFA, could ameliorate the oxidative stress and alteration of leukocyte function in spleen of obese mice. Our findings support a link between obesity and immunosenescence and suggest a potential therapeutic tool for obesity -related immune dysfunction. This article is protected by copyright.

28207180|t|Assembly of the outermost spore layer: pieces of the puzzle are coming together
28207180|a|Certain endospore-forming soil dwelling bacteria are important human, animal or insect pathogens. These organisms produce spores containing an outer layer, the exosporium. The exosporium is the site of interactions between the spore and the soil environment and between the spore and the infected host during the initial stages of infection. The composition and assembly process of the exosporium are poorly understood. This is partly due to the extreme stability of the exosporium that has proven to be refractive to existing methods to deconstruct the intact structure into its component parts. Although more than 20 proteins have been identified as exosporium - associated, their abundance, relationship to other proteins and the processes by which they are assembled to create the exosporium are largely unknown. In this issue of Molecular Microbiology, Terry, Jiang, and colleagues in Per Bullough's laboratory show that the ExsY protein is a major structural protein of the exosporium basal layer of B. cereus family spores and that it can self-assemble into complex structures that possess many of the structural features characteristic of the exosporium basal layer. The authors refined a model for exosporium assembly. Their findings may have implications for exosporium formation in other spore forming bacteria, including Clostridium species.

28207880|t|Skeletal muscle metabolic adaptations to endurance exercise training are attainable in mice with simvastatin treatment
28207880|a|We tested the hypothesis that a 6-week regimen of simvastatin would attenuate skeletal muscle adaptation to low-intensity exercise. Male C57BL/6J wildtype mice were subjected to 6-weeks of voluntary wheel running or normal cage activities with or without simvastatin treatment (20 mg/kg/d, n = 7-8 per group). Adaptations in in vivo fatigue resistance were determined by a treadmill running test, and by ankle plantarflexor contractile assessment. The tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, and plantaris muscles were evaluated for exercised -induced mitochondrial adaptations (i.e., biogenesis, function, autophagy). There was no difference in weekly wheel running distance between control and simvastatin - treated mice (P = 0.51). Trained mice had greater treadmill running distance (296%, P<0.001), and ankle plantarflexor contractile fatigue resistance (9%, P<0.05) compared to sedentary mice, independent of simvastatin treatment. At the cellular level, trained mice had greater mitochondrial biogenesis (e.g., ~2-fold greater PGC1α expression, P<0.05) and mitochondrial content (e.g., 25% greater citrate synthase activity, P<0.05), independent of simvastatin treatment. Mitochondrial autophagy -related protein contents were greater in trained mice (e.g., 40% greater Bnip3, P<0.05), independent of simvastatin treatment. However, Drp1, a marker of mitochondrial fission, was less in simvastatin treated mice, independent of exercise training, and there was a significant interaction between training and statin treatment (P<0.022) for LC3-II protein content, a marker of autophagy flux. These data indicate that whole body and skeletal muscle adaptations to endurance exercise training are attainable with simvastatin treatment, but simvastatin may have side effects on muscle mitochondrial maintenance via autophagy, which could have long-term implications on muscle health.

28210010|t|Evaluation and Treatment of Anemia in Premature Infants
28210010|a|Anemia in preterm infants is the pathophysiological process with greater and more rapid decline in hemoglobin compared to the physiological anemia in infants. There is a need for transfusions and administration of human recombinant erythropoietin. To determine the frequency of anemia in premature infants at the Pediatric Clinic, University Clinical Center Sarajevo, as well as parameter values in the blood count of premature infants and to explore a relationship between blood transfusions with the advent of intraventricular hemorrhage (determine treatment outcome in preterm infants). Research is retrospective study and it included the period of six months in year 2014. Research included 100 patients, gestational age < 37 weeks (premature infants). Data were collected by examining the medical records of patients at the Pediatric Clinic, UCCS. The first group of patients were premature infants of gestational age ≤ 32 weeks (62/100) and the second group were premature infants of gestational age 33-37 weeks (38/100). Among the patients, 5% were boys and 46% girls. There was significant difference in birth weight and APGAR score among the groups. In the first group, there were 27.42% of deaths, while in the second group, there were only 10.53% of deaths. There was a significant difference in the length of treatment. There was a statistically significant difference in the need for transfusion among the groups. 18 patients in the first group required a transfusion, while in the second group only 3 patients. Preterm infants of gestational age ≤ 32 weeks are likely candidates for blood transfusion during treatment. Preterm infants of gestational age ≤ 32 weeks have the risk of intracranial bleeding associated with the application of blood transfusion in the first week of life.

28210659|t|Medial Patellofemoral Ligament Reconstruction Femoral Tunnel Accuracy: Relationship to Disease - Specific Quality of Life
28210659|a|Medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) reconstruction is a procedure aimed to reestablish the checkrein to lateral patellar translation in patients with symptomatic patellofemoral instability. Correct femoral tunnel position is thought to be crucial to successful MPFL reconstruction, but the accuracy of this statement in terms of patient outcomes has not been tested. To assess the accuracy of femoral tunnel placement in an MPFL reconstruction cohort and to determine the correlation between tunnel accuracy and a validated disease - specific, patient -reported quality-of-life outcome measure. Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Between June 2008 and February 2014, a total of 206 subjects underwent an MPFL reconstruction. Lateral radiographs were measured to determine the accuracy of the femoral tunnel by measuring the distance from the center of the femoral tunnel to the Schöttle point. Banff Patella Instability Instrument (BPII) scores were collected a mean 24 months postoperatively. A total of 155 (79.5%) subjects had adequate postoperative lateral radiographs and complete BPII scores. The mean duration of follow-up (± SD) was 24.4 ± 8.2 months (range, 12-74 months). Measurement from the center of the femoral tunnel to the Schöttle point resulted in 143 (92.3%) tunnel s being categorized as " good " or " ideal ." There were 8 failures in the cohort, none of which occurred in malpositioned tunnels. The mean distance from the center of the MPFL tunnel to the center of the Schöttle point was 5.9 ± 4.2 mm (range, 0.5-25.9 mm). The mean postoperative BPII score was 65.2 ± 22.5 (range, 9.2-100). Pearson r correlation demonstrated no statistically significant relationship between accuracy of femoral tunnel position and BPII score (r = -0.08; 95% CI, -0.24 to 0.08). There was no evidence of a correlation between the accuracy of MPFL reconstruction femoral tunnel in relation to the Schöttle point and disease - specific quality-of-life scores. Graft failure was not related to femoral tunnel placement. The patellofemoral instability population is complex, and patients present with multiple risk factors that, in addition to the accuracy of femoral tunnel position, contribute to quality of life and warrant further investigation.

28210819|t|Evidence for instructions -based updating of task-set representations: the informed fadeout effect
28210819|a|The cognitive system can be updated rapidly and efficiently to maximize performance in cognitive tasks. This paper used a task - switching task to explore updating at the level of the plausible task -sets held for future performance. Previous research suggested a " fadeout effect ", performance improvement when moving from task - switching context to single-task context, yet this effect could reflect passive learning rather than intentional control. In a novel " informed fadeout paradigm ", one of two tasks was canceled for a certain number of trials and participants were informed or uninformed regarding task cancelation. The " informed fadeout effect " indicates better performance in the informed than uninformed fadeout after one informed trial had been executed. However, the results regarding the first trial were inconclusive. Possible underlying mechanisms are discussed.

28217198|t|Metacarpophalangeal Joint Arthrodesis of the Thumb - Minimum of Eight Months Follow-up
28217198|a|Disorders of the thumb metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint can lead to significant loss of function and pain. Thumb MCP arthrodesis following traumatic injuries is inadequately described and recent studies have questioned the outcome of this treatment. The purpose of this study was to report outcome and disability following thumb MCP joint arthrodesis in the treatment of chronic instability after traumatic injuries. A retrospective review of 26 patients operated on with MCP joint arthrodesis, median follow-up 42 months (8-104 months). Subjective outcome was assessed using the disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand-questionnaire (DASH). In addition, patient satisfaction, pain, stiffness, and impairment of activities of daily living were assessed on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) followed by a question stating whether they would undergo the same procedure again. Two patients (7.7%) needed re-operation due to nonunion. Four patients (15.4%) needed hardware removal. Median DASH - score was 18 (25-75% range 6-47), with lower DASH score s being better. Score s were significantly worse in gender and age matched individuals (p<0.05). Median VAS for pain was 3.7 (range 0-8). More than 50% of patients reported mild, moderate or severe pain, but all patients reported that they were willing to undergo the same procedure again. Our data suggest, that patients with post-traumatic thumb injuries managed with thumb MCP joint arthrodesis perform worse than gender and age matched individuals. Many lived with pain, but all reported that they were willing to undergo the same procedure again. We suggest that the disability scale by the National Board of Industrial Injuries should be reconsidered for patients operated on with thumb MCP arthrodesis.

28217611|t|Pyoderma gangrenosum: A clinician's nightmare
28217611|a|Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare disease and that affecting specifically the sole of the foot, is even rarer. Here, we report the case of a 54-year- old female admitted with a painful ulcer on the sole of the right foot which was initially treated with empirical antibiotics and debridement. The disease was found to spread rapidly after each debridement. The culture reports were negative; rheumatology workup and Doppler study were within normal limits. A clinical suspicion of PG was made and was confirmed with tissue biopsy. She was started on oral steroids following which she dramatically improved. Thus, when a patient presents with a rapidly expanding painful ulcer in a vascular limb that is refractory to antibiotic treatment and exacerbating on debridement, it is imperative to consider the possibility of PG.

28217766|a|We have created the Neurostimulation Uncertainty Viewer (nuView or νView) tool for exploring data arising from deep brain stimulation (DBS). Simulated volume of tissue activated (VTA), using clinical electrode placements, are recorded along with patient outcomes in the Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS). The data is volumetric and sparse, with multi-value patient results for each activated voxel in the simulation. νView provides a collection of visual methods to explore the activated tissue to enhance understanding of electrode usage for improved therapy with DBS.

28219657|t|Non-pharmacological treatments for pain relief: TENS and acupuncture
28219657|a|Acupuncture and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) are non-pharmacological methods that have been used for millennia to relieve pain. As with all complementary treatments, efficacy evaluations face two hurdles: the non-feasibility of double-blinding and the difficulty in identifying the optimal control population or treatment. Nevertheless, recent studies of good methodological quality have demonstrated benefits in many types of pain compared to conventional treatment. The mechanisms of action of acupuncture and TENS, which are increasingly well understood, involve endogenous pain control systems, cerebral plasticity, and nonspecific effects (e.g., expectations and placebo effect). No serious adverse effects have been reported. These data support the more widespread use of non-pharmacological pain management, most notably in patients with chronic pain inadequately relieved by medications alone.

28220082|t|Synaptic and Neuronal Autoantibody - Associated Psychiatric Syndromes: Controversies and Hypotheses
28220082|a|Autoimmune encephalitis (AE) mediated by antibodies against synaptic and neuronal surface targets frequently presents with a psychiatric syndrome. In these patients, removal of autoantibodies treats the disease and outcomes are closely linked to early intervention. The discovery of these autoantibodies in isolated psychiatric syndromes has raised the possibility that these patients may derive similar benefits from immunotherapy, a potentially transformational approach to the treatment of mental illness. Although open-label case series suggest impressive therapeutic outcomes, the pathological relevance of these autoantibodies outside of canonical presentations is debated. The advent of diagnostic criteria for AE attempts to facilitate its prompt identification but risks prematurely neglecting the potential scientific and clinical significance of isolated syndromes that do not satisfy these criteria. Here, we propose using a syndrome - level taxonomy that has occasional, but not necessary, overlap with AE: synaptic and neuronal autoantibody - associated psychiatric syndromes or " SNAps ". This will prevent confusion with AE and act heuristically to promote active investigation into this rare example of psychopathology defined on a molecular level. We suggest that this concept would have application in other autoantibody - associated syndromes including seizure, cognitive, and movement disorders, in which similar issues arise. We review putative direct and indirect mechanisms and outline experimentally testable hypotheses that would help to determine prospectively in whom autoantibody detection is relevant, and as important, in whom it is not. We summarize a pragmatic approach to autoantibody testing and management in severe mental illness in order to promptly diagnose AE and advocate a research - orientated experimental medicine paradigm for SNAps, where there is greater equipoise. We conclude that SNAps remains a nascent area of clinical neuroscience with great potential and in ongoing need of psychiatry -led basic and clinical research.

28220122|t|NF-κB Links TLR2 and PAR1 to Soluble Immunomodulator Factor Secretion in Human Platelets
28220122|a|The primary toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated immune cell response pathway common for all TLRs is MyD88 -dependent activation of NF-κB, a seminal transcription factor for many chemokines and cytokines. Remarkably, anucleate platelets express the NF-κB machinery, whose role in platelets remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the contribution of NF-κB in the release of cytokines and serotonin by human platelets, following selective stimulation of TLR2 and protease activated receptor 1 (PAR1), a classical and non-classical pattern-recognition receptor, respectively, able to participate to the innate immune system. We discovered that platelet PAR1 activation drives the process of NF-κB phosphorylation, in contrast to TLR2 activation, which induces a slower phosphorylation process. Conversely, platelet PAR1 and TLR2 activation induces similar ERK1/2, p38, and AKT phosphorylation. Moreover, we found that engagement of platelet TLR2 with its ligand, Pam3CSK4, significantly increases the release of sCD62P, RANTES, and sCD40L; this effect was attenuated by incubating platelets with a blocking anti-TLR2 antibody. This effect appeared selective since no modulation of serotonin secretion was observed following platelet TLR2 activation. Platelet release of sCD62P, RANTES, and sCD40L following TLR2 or PAR1 triggering was abolished in the presence of the NF-κB inhibitor Bay11-7082, while serotonin release following PAR1 activation was significantly decreased. These new findings support the concept that NF-κB is an important player in platelet immunoregulations and functions.

28222010|t|Optical tweezers studies of transcription by eukaryotic RNA polymerases
28222010|a|Transcription is the first step in the expression of genetic information and it is carried out by large macromolecular enzymes called RNA polymerases. Transcription has been studied for many years and with a myriad of experimental techniques, ranging from bulk studies to high-resolution transcript sequencing. In this review, we emphasise the advantages of using single-molecule techniques, particularly optical tweezers, to study transcription dynamics. We give an overview of the latest results in the single-molecule transcription field, focusing on transcription by eukaryotic RNA polymerases. Finally, we evaluate recent quantitative models that describe the biophysics of RNA polymerase translocation and backtracking dynamics.

28222462|t|Decreased Frequencies of Peripheral Blood CD4+CD25+CD127-Foxp3+ in Patients with Graves' Disease and Graves' Orbitopathy: Enhancing Effect of Insulin Growth Factor-1 on Treg Cells
28222462|a|Graves' orbitopathy (GO) is characterized by orbital T cell infiltration. We evaluated the regulatory T (Treg) cell fractions induced with IGF-1 in Graves' disease (GD) with and without GO. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from 13 patients with GD without eye manifestations; 10 patients with active GO; and 12 patients with nodular goiter (NG). All the patients from GD, GO, and NG were subclinical hyperthyroid. We analyzed the expression of Treg cell markers (CD4, CD25, CD127(-), Foxp3) on T cells and their ability to respond to IGF-1 stimulation. In patients with GD without GO, we found lowered percentages of CD4(+) Foxp3(+) cells, as compared to nodular goiter 1.77 vs. 5.42% (p=0.0276). Similarly, significantly reduced frequencies of CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(-)Foxp3(+) and CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(-) cells were observed in GD patients as compared to nodular goiter patients with hyperthyreosis, (0.7 vs. 1.48%) (p=0.0071) and (14.5 vs. 37.2%) (p=0.0051), respectively. In GO with active GO, only the percentage of CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(-) cells was found to be decreased versus nodular goiter (9.35 vs. 37.2) (p=0.0275). Stimulation of PBMC derived from GO patients with IGF-1 resulted in significant increase of frequency of both CD4(+) Foxp3(+) and CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(-) Foxp3 cells. Decreased frequencies of peripheral blood CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(-)Foxp3(+) in patients with GD and GO could be an useful marker of autoimmune process and perhaps a possible target for future therapies. This is the first study demonstrating Treg - enhancing effects of IGF-1. Thus IGF-1 can be accounted for modulating Treg cell -related action in GO.

28228227|t|γ-Butenolide and furanone derivatives from the soil -derived fungus Aspergillus sclerotiorum PSU-RSPG178
28228227|a|Chromatographic separation of the broth extract of the soil -derived fungus Aspergillus sclerotiorum PSU-RSPG178 resulted in isolation of four γ-butenolide-furanone dimers, aspersclerotiorones A-D, a furanone derivative, aspersclerotiorone E, and two γ-butenolide derivatives, aspersclerotiorones F and G, together with six known compounds, penicillic acid, dihydropenicillic acid, 5,6-dihydro-6-hydroxypenicillic acid, 6-methoxy-5,6-dihydropenicillic acid, coculnol and (4R,5R)-4,5-dihydroxy-3-methoxy-5-methylcyclohex-2-en-1-one. Their structures were determined by spectroscopic evidence. For aspersclerotiorones A and B, the structures were confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction crystallography. Penicillic acid displayed weak antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli with equal MIC values of 128 μg/mL, and it was noncytotoxic towards African green monkey kidney fibroblast cells.

28228265|t|E3 Ligase RNF126 Directly Ubiquitinates Frataxin, Promoting Its Degradation: Identification of a Potential Therapeutic Target for Friedreich Ataxia
28228265|a|Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is a severe genetic neurodegenerative disease caused by reduced expression of the mitochondrial protein frataxin. To date, there is no therapy to treat this condition. The amount of residual frataxin critically affects the severity of the disease; thus, attempts to restore physiological frataxin levels are considered therapeutically relevant. Frataxin levels are controlled by the ubiquitin-proteasome system; therefore, inhibition of the frataxin E3 ligase may represent a strategy to achieve an increase in frataxin levels. Here, we report the identification of the RING E3 ligase RNF126 as the enzyme that specifically mediates frataxin ubiquitination and targets it for degradation. RNF126 interacts with frataxin and promotes its ubiquitination in a catalytic activity - dependent manner, both in vivo and in vitro. Most importantly, RNF126 depletion results in frataxin accumulation in cells derived from FRDA patients, highlighting the relevance of RNF126 as a new therapeutic target for Friedreich ataxia.

28228370|t|Enhancing Doctors' Competencies in Communication With and Activation of Older Patients: The Promoting Active Aging (PRACTA) Computer-Based Intervention Study
28228370|a|Demographic changes over the past decades call for the promotion of health and disease prevention for older patients, as well as strategies to enhance their independence, productivity, and quality of life. Our objective was to examine the effects of a computer-based educational intervention designed for general practitioners (GPs) to promote active aging. The Promoting Active Aging (PRACTA) study consisted of a baseline questionnaire, implementation of an intervention, and a follow-up questionnaire that was administered 1 month after the intervention. A total of 151 primary care facilities (response rate 151/767, 19.7%) and 503 GPs (response rate 503/996, 50.5%) agreed to participate in the baseline assessment. At the follow-up, 393 GPs filled in the questionnaires (response rate, 393/503, 78.1%), but not all of them took part in the intervention. The final study group of 225 GPs participated in 3 study conditions: e-learning (knowledge plus skills modelling, n=42), a pdf article (knowledge only, n=89), and control (no intervention, n=94). We measured the outcome as scores on the Patients Expectations Scale, Communication Scale, Attitude Toward Treatment and Health Scale, and Self-Efficacy Scale. GPs participating in e-learning demonstrated a significant rise in their perception of older patients ' expectations for disease explanation (Wald χ(2)=19.7, P<.001) and in perception of motivational aspect of older patients ' attitude toward treatment and health (Wald χ(2)=8.9, P=.03) in comparison with both the control and pdf article groups. We observed additional between- group differences at the level of statistical trend. GPs participating in the pdf article intervention demonstrated a decline in self-assessed communication, both at the level of global scoring (Wald χ(2)=34.5, P<.001) and at the level of 20 of 26 specific behaviors (all P<.05). Factors moderating the effects of the intervention were the number of patients per GP and the facility's organizational structure. Both methods were suitable, but in different areas and under different conditions. The key benefit of the pdf article intervention was raising doctors ' reflection on limitations in their communication skills, whereas e-learning was more effective in changing their perception of older patients ' proactive attitude, especially among GPs working in privately owned facilities and having a greater number of assigned patients. Although we did not achieve all expected effects of the PRACTA intervention, both its forms seem promising in terms of enhancing the competencies of doctors in communication with and activation of older patients.

28229178|t|The consummatory and motivational behaviors for natural rewards following long-term withdrawal from morphine: no anhedonia but persistent maladaptive behaviors for high-value rewards
28229178|a|The negative affective state, e.g., anhedonia, emerges after abstinence from abused drugs may be linked to the motivational processes of drug craving and relapse. Although anhedonia diminishes over time with drug abstinence, it is not yet rather explicit whether anhedonia exists or not following protracted withdrawal. The behavioral responses to natural rewards were examined after 2 to 3 weeks withdrawal from morphine. Male rats were pretreated with either a binge-like morphine paradigm or daily saline injection for 5 days. The consummatory and motivational behaviors for three natural rewards (sucrose solutions 4, 15, and 60%, social stimulus: male rat, and sexual stimulus: estrous female rat) were examined under varied testing conditions. The morphine - withdrawn rats significantly increased their intake of 15% sucrose solution during the 1-h consumption test and their operant responding for 15% sucrose solution under a progressive ratio (PR) schedule of reinforcement. When obtaining a reinforcer was associated with a 0.5 mA foot shock under a PR-punishment schedule, the morphine - withdrawn rats showed a higher performance for 60% sucrose solution. Meanwhile, the morphine - withdrawn rats displayed a higher motivation to sexual stimulus during the free-approach test and more approaching behaviors towards sexual stimulus in a conflict-based approach test (concurrent presence of reward and aversive stimulus). No anhedonia -like behavior but sensitized behaviors for natural rewards were found after long-term morphine withdrawal. Notably, the morphine - withdrawn rats displayed persistent motivated behaviors for high-value rewards (60% sucrose and sexual stimulus) in the conflict tests suggesting impairments in inhibitory control in morphine - treated rats.

28230977|t|Extracellular Self-Assembly of Functional and Tunable Protein Conjugates from Bacillus subtilis
28230977|a|The ability to stably and specifically conjugate recombinant proteins to one another is a powerful approach for engineering multifunctional enzymes, protein therapeutics, and novel biological materials. While many of these applications have been illustrated through in vitro and in vivo intracellular protein conjugation methods, extracellular self-assembly of protein conjugates offers unique advantages: simplifying purification, reducing toxicity and burden, and enabling tunability. Exploiting the recently described SpyTag-SpyCatcher system, we describe here how enzymes and structural proteins can be genetically encoded to covalently conjugate in culture media following programmable secretion from Bacillus subtilis. Using this approach, we demonstrate how self-conjugation of a secreted industrial enzyme, XynA, dramatically increases its resilience to boiling, and we show that cellular consortia can be engineered to self-assemble functional protein-protein conjugates with tunable composition. This novel genetically encoded modular system provides a flexible strategy for protein conjugation harnessing the substantial advantages of extracellular self-assembly.

28234672|t|Vascular smooth muscle cell peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ protects against endothelin-1 - induced oxidative stress and inflammation
28234672|a|Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) agonists reduce blood pressure and vascular injury in hypertensive rodents. Pparγ inactivation in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) enhances vascular injury. Transgenic mice overexpressing endothelin (ET)-1 selectively in the endothelium (eET-1) exhibit endothelial dysfunction, increased oxidative stress and inflammation. We hypothesized that inactivation of the Pparγ gene in VSMC (smPparγ) would exaggerate ET-1 - induced vascular injury. eET-1, smPparγ and eET-1 / smPparγ mice were treated with tamoxifen for 5 days and studied 4 weeks later. SBP was higher in eET-1 and unaffected by smPparγ inactivation. Mesenteric artery vasodilatory responses to acetylcholine were impaired only in smPparγ. N-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester abrogated relaxation responses, and the Ednra / Ednrb mRNA ratio was decreased in eET-1 / smPparγ, which could indicate that nitric oxide production was enhanced by ET-1 stimulation of endothelin type B receptors. Mesenteric artery media / lumen was greater only in eET-1 / smPparγ. Mesenteric artery reactive oxygen species increased in smPparγ and were further enhanced in eET-1 / smPparγ. Perivascular fat monocyte / macrophage infiltration was higher in eET-1 and smPparγ and increased further in eET-1 / smPparγ. Spleen CD11b cells were increased in smPparγ and further enhance d in eET-1 / smPparγ, whereas Ly-6C monocytes increased in eET-1 and smPparγ but not in eET-1 / smPparγ. Spleen T regulatory lymphocytes increased in smPparγ and decreased in eET-1, and decreased further in eET-1 / smPparγ. VSMC Pparγ inactivation exaggerates ET-1 - induced vascular injury, supporting a protective role for PPARγ in hypertension through modulation of pro-oxidant and proinflammatory pathways. Paradoxically, ET-1 overexpression preserved endothelial function in smPparγ mice, presumably by enhancing nitric oxide through stimulation of endothelin type B receptors.

28235120|t|Prospective Evaluation of Opioid Consumption After Distal Radius Fracture Repair Surgery
28235120|a|Pain management and opioid consumption after distal radius fracture (DRF) open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) are highly variable and poorly understood. To optimize postoperative opioid dosage and better understand opioid consumption patterns after DRF - ORIF, we conducted a prospective study with the hypothesis that opioid consumption would increase with worsening fracture classification and various patient demographics. All patients who underwent DRF - ORIF were consecutively enrolled over a 6-month period. Information collected included patient demographics, fracture type, anesthesia type, amount and type of opioid prescribed, number of pills taken, reason for stopping, and adverse events. Statistical analysis was performed. Ninety-eight patients (79 female, 19 male) were eligible for the study. Mean age was 58 years. Of the 98 patients, 45 received general anesthesia, and 53 received regional anesthesia with a single-shot peripheral nerve block. Mean opioid consumption (morphine equivalence) over a mean of 4.8 postoperative days (range, 0-16 days) was 58.5 mg (range, 0-280 mg). There were no significant differences in opioid consumption between the general and regional anesthesia groups. Mean opioid consumption for the 3 fracture-type groups (AO/OTA [Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Osteosynthesefragen/Orthopaedic Trauma Association] classification) was 57.7 mg (class A), 60.3 mg (class B), and 62.0 mg (class C). Demographic analysis revealed an inverse relationship between age and opioid use. Similarly, there was a trend toward more opioid consumption among self-pay and Medicaid patients. Opioid consumption after DRF - ORIF was equivalent for general and regional anesthesia. A significant relationship was found between increasing age and decreasing opioid consumption. Worsening fracture classification and self-payment / Medicaid payment trended toward increasing opioid consumption. Mean overall opioid consumption (morphine equivalence) was 58.5 mg, or 14.6 pills of oxycodone/acetaminophen 5/325 mg. Surgeons should take these findings into account when optimizing opioid prescribing after DRF repair.

28236130|t|Entrapment of the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve and its inferior cluneal branches: anatomical basis of surgery for inferior cluneal neuralgia
28236130|a|The apparent failure of pudendal nerve surgery in some patients has led us to suggest the possibility of entrapment of other adjacent nerve structures, leading to the concept of inferior cluneal neuralgia. Via its numerous collateral branches, the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve innervates a very extensive territory including the posterior surface of the thigh, the infragluteal fold, the skin over the ischial tuberosity, but also the lateral anal region, scrotum or labium majus via its perineal branch. We described the pathophysiological features of cluneal neuralgia, the surgical technique and our preliminary results. We performed a transmuscular approach leading to the fat of the deep gluteal region. Exploration was continued cranially underneath the piriformis, looking for potential entrapments affecting the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve and the sciatic nerve. Nerve decompression on the lateral surface of the ischial tuberosity was then performed. A constant anatomical finding must be highlighted: the presence of a lateral fibrous expansion from the ischium passing behind the nerves and vessels, especially the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve and its perineal branches. In our patients, release of this expansion allowed decompression of the nerve trapped by this expansion. Cluneal neuralgia constitutes a distinct entity of perineal pain, which must be identified and distinguished from pudendal neuralgia. Surgery should be performed via a transgluteal approach. A lateral ischial obstacle must be investigated, in the form of a constant fibrous expansion, which, like a retinaculum, can cause nerve entrapment.

28237116|t|Methods to Study Autophagy in Zebrafish
28237116|a|Autophagy (cellular self-eating) is a highly regulated degradation process of the eukaryotic cell during which parts of the cytoplasm are delivered into, and broken down within, the lysosomal compartment. The process serves as a main route for the elimination of superfluous and damaged cellular constituents, thereby mediating macromolecular and organellar turnover. In addition to maintaining cellular homeostasis, autophagy is involved in various other cellular and developmental processes by degrading specific regulatory proteins, and contributing to the clearance of intracellular pathogens. The physiological roles and pathological involvement of autophagy can be effectively studied in divergent eukaryotic model systems ranging from yeast to mice. Such a tractable animal model applied only recently for autophagy researchis the zebrafish Danio rerio, which also facilitates the analysis of more specific biological processes such as tissue regeneration. In this chapter, we overview the main methods and tools that are used to monitor autophagic structures and to assay autophagic responses in this vertebrate organism. We place emphasis on genetic (functional) approaches applied for exploring novel cellular and developmental roles of the autophagic process.

28237961|t|Healthcare usage and economic impact of non-treated obesity in Italy: findings from a retrospective administrative and clinical database analysis
28237961|a|Investigate the prevalence of obesity in Italy and examine its resource consumption and economic impact on the Italian national healthcare system (NHS). Retrospective, observational and real-life study. Data from three health units from Northern (Bergamo, Lombardy), Central (Grosseto, Tuscany) and Southern (Naples, Campania) Italy. All patients aged ≥18 years with at least one recorded body mass index (BMI) measurement between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2012 were included. Information retrieved from the databases included primary care data, medical prescriptions, specialist consultations and hospital discharge records from 2009-2013. Costs associated with these data were also calculated. Data are presented for two time periods (1 year after BMI measurement and study end). Primary -to estimate health resources consumption and the associated economic impact on the Italian NHS. Secondary -the prevalence and characteristics of subjects by BMI category. 20 159 adult subjects with at least one documented BMI measurement. Subjects with BMI ≥30 kg/m(2) were defined as obese. The prevalence of obesity was 22.2% (N=4471) and increased with age. At the 1-year observation period, obese subjects who did not receive treatment for their obesity experienced longer durations of hospitalisation (median length: 5 days vs 3 days), used more prescription drugs (75.0% vs 57.7%), required more specialised outpatient healthcare (mean number: 5.3 vs 4.4) and were associated with greater costs, primarily owing to prescription drugs and hospital admissions (mean annual cost per year per patient: €460.6 vs €288.0 for drug prescriptions, €422.7 vs € 279.2 for hospitalisations and €283.2 vs €251.7 for outpatient care), compared with normal weight subjects. Similar findings were observed for the period up to data cut-off (mean follow-up of 2.7 years). Untreated obesity has a significant economic impact on the Italian healthcare system, highlighting the need to raise awareness and proactively treat obese subjects.

28239032|t|Effects of heat treatment on conformation and cell growth activity of alpha- lactalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin from market milk
28239032|a|Heat processes, low temperature for long time (LTLT) pasteurization and ultra-heat treatment (UHT) sterilization, are essential for commercial market milk to improve the shelf life of raw milk and ensure microbial safety. We evaluated the effects of heat experience on the molecular properties of α-lactalbumin (α-LA) and β-lactoglobulin (β-LG) isolated from four types of market milk such as LTLT-A (66°C for 30 min), LTLT-B (65°C for 30 min), UHT-I (130°C for 2 s, indirect heating) and UHT-D (135°C for 2 s, direct heating) samples. We examined molecular conformations using circular dichroism spectrum measurement and cell growth activity using the WST-1 method for the proteins. α-LA isolated from each of these four types of market milk displayed no significant structural difference as compared to raw milk α-LA, while α-LA of UHT-I only inhibited cell growth of an intestinal epithelial cell line more potently than raw milk α-LA. In the case of β-LG, only the UHT-I sample demonstrated a drastic change in structure, while it did not exhibit any cytotoxicity. We found that cell viability effects of α-LA and β-LG are attributable to the type of UHT; indirect and direct. These findings indicate that the effect of heat treatment on whey proteins should carefully be investigated further.

28240640|t|Comparison of 270 Versus 320 mg I/mL of Iodixanol in 1 Image Assessment of Both Renal Arteries and Veins With Dual-Energy Spectral CT Imaging in Late Arterial Phase and Their Influence on Renal Function
28240640|a|The objective of this study was to compare the image quality of renal arteries and veins with dual-energy spectral computed tomography (CT) imaging in late arterial phase using 270 and 320 mg I/mL of iodixanol and their influence on renal function. A total of 1062 patients underwent renal CT angiography with 270 or 320 mg I/mL of iodixanol with dual-energy spectral CT imaging in late arterial phase. Image quality and their influence on renal function were compared. There were no significant differences of CT value, signal-to-noise ratio, contrast-to-noise ratio, and subjective score of renal vessels between 2 groups (all P > 0.05). The incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy in patients with abnormal renal function using 320 mg I/mL of iodixanol was significantly higher than using 270 mg I/mL of iodixanol (P = 0.043). The renal arteries and veins can be fully assessed in late arterial phase with 270 mg I/mL of iodixanol using dual-energy spectral CT scan with better preserved renal function.

28241991|t|Effect of magnesium supplementation on depression status in depressed patients with magnesium deficiency: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
28241991|a|The aim of this study was to determine the effect of magnesium supplementation on the depression status of depressed patients suffering from magnesium deficiency. Sixty depressed people suffering from hypomagnesemia participated in this trial. The individuals were randomly categorized into two groups of 30 members; one receiving two 250-mg tablets of magnesium oxide (MG) daily and the other receiving placebo (PG) for 8 wk. The Beck Depression Inventory-II was conducted and the concentration of serum magnesium was measured. At the end of intervention, 88.5% of the MG and 48.1% of the PG (P = 0.002) had a normal level of magnesium. The mean changes of serum magnesium were significantly different across the two groups. After the intervention, the mean Beck score significantly declined. However, in the MG, this reduction was more significant than in the PG (P = 0.02), so that the mean changes in this group experienced 15.65 ± 8.9 reduction, but in the PG, it declined by 10.40 ± 7.9. Daily consumption of 500 mg magnesium oxide tablets for ≥8 wk by depressed patients suffering from magnesium deficiency leads to improvements in depression status and magnesium levels. Therefore, assessment of the magnesium serum and resolving this deficiency positively influence the treatment of depressed patients.

28243780|t|The influence of cognitive load on metabolic cost of transport during overground walking in healthy, young adults
28243780|a|Our aim was to examine whether cognitive processing during walking increases the metabolic cost of transport in healthy young adults. Twenty healthy, young adults completed five conditions: (1) walking at a self - selected speed (spontaneous single-task), (2) seated resting (baseline), (3) performing cognitive task while seated (cognitive single-task), (4) walking while simultaneously performing the cognitive task (dual-task), and (5) single-task walking at a speed that matched the participant's dual-task gait speed (matched single-task). Rate of oxygen consumption (V̇O2) was recorded during all conditions. Gait speed and cost of walking (Cw; oxygen consumed per distance traveled) were recorded during all walking conditions. Reaction time and accuracy of responses in the cognitive task were recorded during all cognitive task conditions. Data from the fifth minute of each 5- min condition were analyzed. There was no difference in V̇O2 between the dual-task and matched single-task walking conditions. V̇O2 in the seated cognitive condition was significantly smaller than both walking conditions, but was not significantly different than zero. Cw was significantly greater during the matched single-task walking condition than during the dual-task walking condition. However, the difference in Cw was so small that it is unlikely to be clinically significant (0.008 mLO2/kg/m, 95% CI 0.002-0.014). Cognitive processing while walking may not increase energy demands of walking in healthy young adults. Maintaining non-preferred gait speed (matched speed) overground continuously for 5 min may require attentional resources, and thereby increase metabolic costs relative to walking at habitual speed.

28245193|t|Problem-based learning using patient -simulated videos showing daily life for a comprehensive clinical approach
28245193|a|We examined whether problem-based learning tutorials using patient -simulated videos showing daily life are more practical for clinical learning, compared with traditional paper-based problem-based learning, for the consideration rate of psychosocial issues and the recall rate for experienced learning. Twenty-two groups with 120 fifth- year students were each assigned paper-based problem-based learning and video -based problem-based learning using patient -simulated videos. We compared target achievement rates in questionnaires using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and discussion contents diversity using the Mann-Whitney U test. A follow-up survey used a chi-square test to measure students ' recall of cases in three categories: video, paper, and non-experienced. Video -based problem-based learning displayed significantly higher achievement rates for imagining authentic patients (p=0.001), incorporating a comprehensive approach including psychosocial aspects (p<0.001), and satisfaction with sessions (p=0.001). No significant differences existed in the discussion contents diversity regarding the International Classification of Primary Care Second Edition codes and chapter types or in the rate of psychological codes. In a follow-up survey comparing video and paper groups to non-experienced groups, the rates were higher for video (χ(2)=24.319, p<0.001) and paper (χ(2)=11.134, p=0.001). Although the video rate tended to be higher than the paper rate, no significant difference was found between the two. Patient -simulated videos showing daily life facilitate imagining true patients and support a comprehensive approach that fosters better memory. The clinical patient -simulated video method is more practical and clinical problem-based tutorials can be implemented if we create patient -simulated videos for each symptom as teaching materials.

28246934|t|Forensic characteristics and phylogenetic analyses of the Chinese Yi population via 19 X-chromosomal STR loci
28246934|a|The demographic characteristics and genetic polymorphism data of 56 Chinese nationalities or 31 administrative divisions in Chinese mainland have repeatedly been the genetic research hotspots. While most genetic studies focused on some particular Chinese populations based on autosomal or Y-chromosomal genetic markers, the forensic characteristics and phylogenetic analyses of the seventh largest Chinese population (Yi ethnicity) on the X-chromosomal genetic markers are scarce. Here, allele frequencies and forensic statistical parameters for 19 X-chromosomal short tandem repeat loci (DXS7424-DXS101, DXS6789-DXS6809, DXS7423-DXS10134, DXS10103-HPRTB-DXS10101, DXS10159-DXS10162-DXS10164, DXS10148-DXS10135-DXS8378, and DXS7132-DXS10079-DXS10074-DXS10075) of 331 Chinese Yi individuals were obtained. All 19 X-chromosomal short tandem repeat (STR) loci in females were consistent with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test. A total of 214 alleles were identified with the corresponding allele frequencies spanned from 0.0019 to 0.6106. The combined PE, PDF, and PDM were 0.9999999214, 0.9999999999999999999993, and 0.9999999999998, respectively. The high combined MECKrüger, MECKishida, MECDesmarais, and MECDesmarais Duo were achieved as 0.9999999617638, 0.9999999999971, 0.9999999999971, and 0.9999999931538, respectively. The findings suggested that the panel of 19 X-STR loci is highly polymorphic and informative in the Yi ethnic population and can be considered to be a powerful tool in forensic complex kinship identification. Population differentiation analyses among 12 populations indicated that significant differences in genetic structure were observed in between the Yi ethnicity and the Chinese Uyghur as well as Kazakh, and genetic homogeneity existed in similar ethno-origin or geographic origin populations.

28249160|t|Loss of Snf5 Induces Formation of an Aberrant SWI/SNF Complex
28249160|a|The SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex is highly conserved from yeast to human, and aberrant SWI/SNF complexes contribute to human disease. The Snf5/SMARCB1/INI1 subunit of SWI/SNF is a tumor suppressor frequently lost in pediatric rhabdoid cancers. We examined the effects of Snf5 loss on the composition, nucleosome binding, recruitment, and remodeling activities of yeast SWI/SNF. The Snf5 subunit is shown by crosslinking-mass spectrometry (CX-MS) and subunit deletion analysis to interact with the ATPase domain of Snf2 and to form a submodule consisting of Snf5, Swp82, and Taf14. Snf5 promotes binding of the Snf2 ATPase domain to nucleosomal DNA and enhances the catalytic and nucleosome remodeling activities of SWI/SNF. Snf5 is also required for SWI/SNF recruitment by acidic transcription factors. RNA-seq analysis suggests that both the recruitment and remodeling functions of Snf5 are required in vivo for SWI/SNF regulation of gene expression. Thus, loss of SNF5 alters the structure and function of SWI/SNF.

28249785|t|Identifying the presence of Parkinson's disease using low-frequency fluctuations in BOLD signals
28249785|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive, and degenerative neurological disorder that is characterized by the degeneration of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra and the formation of intracellular Lewy inclusion bodies. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) has demonstrated evidence of changes in metabolic patterns in individuals with PD. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the presence of PD could be " predicted " based on resting fluctuations in the blood oxygenation level dependent signal. We utilized RS-fMRI to measure the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and the fractional ALFF (fALFF) in 51 patients with PD and 50 age - and sex -matched healthy controls. Compared with the healthy controls, the individuals with PD exhibited altered ALFFs in the bilateral lingual gyrus and left putamen and an altered fALFF in the right cerebellum posterior lobe. Support vector machines (SVMs), which comprise a supervised pattern recognition method that enables predictions at the individual level, were trained to separate individuals with PD from healthy controls based on the ALFF and fALFF. Using the leave-one-out cross-validation method to analyze our sample, we reliably distinguished the participants with PD from the controls with 92% sensitivity and 87% specificity. Overall, these findings suggest that the SVM - neuroimaging approach may be of particular clinical value because it enables the accurate identification of PD at the individual level. RS-fMRI should be considered for development as a biomarker and an analytical tool for the evaluation of PD.

28250235|t|Methylation dynamics during folliculogenesis and early embryo development in sheep
28250235|a|Genome -wide DNA methylation reprogramming occurs during mammalian gametogenesis and early embryogenesis. Post - fertilization demethylation of paternal and maternal genomes is considered to occur by an active and passive mechanism respectively, in most mammals but sheep; in this species no loss of methylation was observed in either pronucleus. Post - fertilization reprogramming relies on methylating and demethylating enzymes and co-factors that are stored during oocyte growth, concurrently with the re-methylation of the oocyte itself. The crucial remodelling of the oocyte epigenetic baggage often overlaps with potential interfering events such as exposure to assisted reproduction technologies or environmental changes. Here, we report a temporal analysis of methylation dynamics during folliculogenesis and early embryo development in sheep. We characterized global DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation by immunofluorescence and relatively quantified the expression of the enzymes and co-factors mainly responsible for their remodelling (DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins and methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) proteins). Our results illustrate for the first time the patterns of hydroxymethylation during oocyte growth. We observed different patterns of methylation and hydroxymethylation between the two parental pronuclei, suggesting that male pronucleus undergoes active demethylation also in sheep. Finally, we describe gene -specific accumulation dynamics for methylating and demethylating enzymes during oocyte growth and observe patterns of expression associated with developmental competence in a differential model of oocyte potential. Our work contributes to the understanding of the methylation dynamics during folliculogenesis and early embryo development and improves the overall picture of early rearrangements that will originate the embryo epigenome.

28250430|t|Network analysis reveals why Xylella fastidiosa will persist in Europe
28250430|a|The insect vector borne bacterium Xylella fastidiosa was first detected in olive trees in Southern Italy in 2013, and identified as the main culprit behind the ' olive quick decline syndrome '. Since then, the disease has spread rapidly through Italy's main olive oil producing region. The epidemiology of the outbreak is largely unstudied, with the list of X. fastidiosa hosts and vectors in Europe likely incomplete, and the role humans play in dispersal unknown. These knowledge gaps have led to management strategies based on general assumptions that require, among others, local vector control and, in certain areas, the destruction of infected plants and healthy ones around them in an attempt to eradicate or halt the spreading pest. Here we show that, regardless of epidemiological uncertainties, the mere distribution of olive orchards in Southern Italy makes the chances of eradicating X. fastidiosa from the region extremely slim. Our results imply that Southern Italy is becoming a reservoir for X. fastidiosa. As a consequence, management strategies should keep the prevalence of X. fastidiosa in the region as low as possible, primarily through vector control, lest the pathogen, that has also been detected in southern France and the island of Mallorca (Spain), continues spreading through Italy and Europe.

28251086|t|Novel biomarkers for patients with idiopathic acute anterior uveitis: neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio and platelet to lymphocyte ratio
28251086|a|To assess the levels of the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (N / L) and the platelet to lymphocyte ratio (P / L) in patients with idiopathic acute anterior uveitis (AAU) and to compare with healthy controls. Thirty-six male patients with idiopathic AAU and 36 male healthy subjects were enrolled in this retrospective study. Complete ophthalmological examination and complete blood count measurements results of all subjects were evaluated. There was a significant difference in N / L and P / L between idiopathic AAU and control groups (P=0.006, P=0.022). Also, correlation analysis revealed a significant correlation between C-reactive protein (CRP) and N / L (P=0.002; r=0.461). Our study for the first time provides evidence of N / L and P / L may be useful biomarkers in patients with idiopathic AAU. N / L is correlated with CRP, so it can be a useful biomarker to predict the prognosis in idiopathic AAU.

28251780|t|Comparison between magnetic resonance imaging and B-mode ultrasound in detecting and estimating the extent of human carotid atherosclerosis
28251780|a|In MRI studies of carotid plaques, ultrasound is used to find plaques, which are later imaged using MRI. The performance in plaque detection has not been compared between the modalities. The aim of the current study was to compare the performance of MRI and ultrasound in detecting carotid artery plaques and measuring extent of atherosclerosis. Subjects with at least one plaque (height ≥2·5 mm) on ultrasound were imaged using MRI. The number of plaques and their height was measured in both modalities; plaque area and volume were analysed on ultrasound and MRI, respectively. Thirty-eight subjects were included. MRI detected plaques in 95% of carotid arteries with a plaque height of ≥2·5 mm on ultrasound and in all carotid arteries with a plaque exceeding 2·5 mm. MRI detected 53% of the plaques with a height below 2·5 mm. The plaque height measured with both techniques correlated significantly, 0·59, P<0·0001. Ultrasound -derived plaque height and plaque area correlated similarly to MRI -derived plaque volume, r = 0·52; P<0·0001 and r = 0·47; P = 0·001, respectively. We conclude that MRI has a similar sensitivity to ultrasound in finding carotid artery plaques that are 2·5 mm or higher. In smaller plaques, MRI detects fewer plaques. Multiple carotid plaques seen on ultrasound most often are a misinterpretation of the anatomy and correspond to a single plaque. Plaque height on ultrasound is comparable to plaque height on MRI and correlates fairly well with plaque volume on MRI making it an interesting proxy for plaque burden.

28252933|t|Lightweight Open-Cell Scaffolds from Sea Urchin Spines with Superior Material Properties for Bone Defect Repair
28252933|a|Sea urchin spines (Heterocentrotus mammillatus), with a hierarchical open-cell structure similar to that of human trabecular bone and superior mechanical property (compressive strength ∼43.4 MPa) suitable for machining to shape, were explored for potential applications of bone defect repair. Finite element analyses reveal that the compressive stress concentrates along the dense growth rings and dissipates through strut structures of the stereoms, indicating that the exquisite mesostructures play an important role in high strength -to- weight ratios. The fracture strength of magnesium - substituted tricalcium phosphate (β-TCMP) scaffolds produced by hydrothermal conversion of urchin spines is about 9.3 MPa, comparable to that of human trabecular bone. New bone forms along outer surfaces of β-TCMP scaffolds after implantation in rabbit femoral defects for one month and grows into the majority of the inner open-cell spaces postoperation in three month s, showing tight interface between the scaffold and regenerative bone tissue. Fusion of beagle lumbar facet joints using a Ti-6Al-4V cage and β-TCMP scaffold can be completed within seven months with obvious biodegradation of the β-TCMP scaffold, which is nearly completely degraded and replaced by newly formed bone ten months after implantation. Thus, sea urchin spines suitable for machining to shape have advantages for production of biodegradable artificial grafts for bone defect repair.

28254544|t|Melatonin and nitric oxide regulate sunflower seedling growth under salt stress accompanying differential expression of Cu/Zn SOD and Mn SOD
28254544|a|Salinity results in significant reduction in sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) seedling growth and excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Present work highlights the possible role of melatonin as an antioxidant through its interaction with nitric oxide (NO), and as an early and long distance NaCl-stress sensing signaling molecule in seedling cotyledons. Exogenous melatonin (15µM)± NaCl (120mM) inhibit seedling growth, which is also correlated with NO availability, accumulation of potential superoxide anion (O2(•-)) and peroxynitrite anion (ONOO(-)), extent of tyrosine-nitration of proteins, spatial localization and activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) isoforms. NO acts as a positive modulator of melatonin accumulation in seedling cotyledons as a long-distance signaling response. Modulation of superoxide anion and peroxynitrite anion content by melatonin highlights its crucial role in combating deleterious effects of ROS and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Present findings provide evidence for an interaction between melatonin and NO in their effect on seedling growth under salt stress accompanying differential modulation of two SOD isoforms, i.e. Cu/Zn SOD and Mn SOD.

28258572|t|The Physiological Role and Regulation of Aquaporins in Teleost Germ Cells
28258572|a|The unicellular germ cells and gametes of oviparous teleosts lack the osmoregulatory organs present in juveniles and adults, yet during development and particularly at spawning, they face tremendous osmotic challenges when released into the external aquatic environment. Increasing evidence suggests that transmembrane water channels (aquaporins) evolved to play vital adaptive roles that mitigate the osmotic and oxidative stress problems of the developing oocytes, embryos and spermatozoa. In this chapter, we provide a short overview of the diversity of the aquaporin superfamily in teleosts, and summarize the findings that uncovered a highly specific molecular regulation of aquaporins during oogenesis and spermatogenesis. We further review the multiple functions that these channels play during the establishment of egg buoyancy and the activation and detoxification of spermatozoa in the marine environment.

28261447|t|Caribbean massive corals not recovering from repeated thermal stress events during 2005-2013
28261447|a|Massive coral bleaching events associated with high sea surface temperatures are forecast to become more frequent and severe in the future due to climate change. Monitoring colony recovery from bleaching disturbances over multiyear time frames is important for improving predictions of future coral community changes. However, there are currently few multiyear studies describing long-term outcomes for coral colonies following acute bleaching events. We recorded colony pigmentation and size for bleached and unbleached groups of co-located conspecifics of three major reef-building scleractinian corals (Orbicella franksi, Siderastrea siderea, and Stephanocoenia michelini; n = 198 total) in Bocas del Toro, Panama, during the major 2005 bleaching event and then monitored pigmentation status and changes live tissue colony size for 8 years (2005-2013). Corals that were bleached in 2005 demonstrated markedly different response trajectories compared to unbleached colony groups, with extensive live tissue loss for bleached corals of all species following bleaching, with mean live tissue losses per colony 9 months postbleaching of 26.2% (±5.4 SE) for O. franksi, 35.7% (±4.7 SE) for S. michelini, and 11.2% (±3.9 SE) for S. siderea. Two species, O. franksi and S. michelini, later recovered to net positive growth, which continued until a second thermal stress event in 2010. Following this event, all species again lost tissue, with previously unbleached colony species groups experiencing greater declines than conspecific sample groups, which were previously bleached, indicating a possible positive acclimative response. However, despite this beneficial effect for previously bleached corals, all groups experienced substantial net tissue loss between 2005 and 2013, indicating that many important Caribbean reef-building corals will likely suffer continued tissue loss and may be unable to maintain current benthic coverage when faced with future thermal stress forecast for the region, even with potential benefits from bleaching -related acclimation.

28263833|t|Preparation and characterization of gastrointestinal wafer formulations
28263833|a|Many active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) have a very poor or highly variable bioavailability after oral administration. One possibility to overcome this problem might be found in the application of mucoadhesive dosage forms like gastrointestinal wafers. However, a currently unsolved challenge is the control of the adhesion of the wafer to the intestinal mucus. One suggested solution might be the combination of gastrointestinal wafers and expanding systems. Such a combination requires thin and elastic wafers which are further characterized by an unidirectional drug release. In this study gastrointestinal, twolayered wafers containing a water-insoluble backing layer and a drug-loaded, mucoadhesive layer were fabricated by casting solvent technique. The backing layer consists of Ethocel™ Standard 10 Premium and the mucoadhesive layer was prepared using a mixture of Methocel™ E15 Premium LV, polyvinyl alcohol and Macrogol 400. The wafers were characterized regarding their appearance, mechanical properties and dissolution profiles as well as the influence of backing layer thickness on drug transfer and their ability of unidirectional drug release. The wafers with backing layer thickness of 500μg Ethocel ™/cm(2) presented adequate mechanical properties, a drug transfer about 73% and unidirectional drug release.

28264678|t|Passive case detection of malaria in Ratanakiri Province (Cambodia) to detect villages at higher risk for malaria
28264678|a|Cambodia reduced malaria incidence by more than 75% between 2000 and 2015, a target of the Millennium Development Goal 6. The Cambodian Government aims to eliminate all forms of malaria by 2025. The country's malaria incidence is highly variable at provincial level, but less is known at village level. This study used passive case detection (PCD) data at village level in Ratanakiri Province from 2010 to 2014 to describe incidence trends and identify high-risk areas of malaria to be primarily targeted towards malaria elimination. In 2010, the Cambodian malaria programme created a Malaria Information System (MIS) to capture malaria information at village level through PCD by village malaria workers and health facilities. The MIS data of Ratanakiri Province 2010-2014 were used to calculate annual incidence rates by Plasmodium species at province and commune levels. For estimating the trend at provincial level only villages reporting each year were selected. The communal incidences and the number of cases per village were visualized on a map per Plasmodium species and per year. Analysis of spatial clustering of village malaria cases by Plasmodium species was performed by year. Overall, malaria annual incidence rates per 1000 inhabitants decreased from 86 (2010) to 30 (2014). Falciparum incidence decreased (by 79% in 2014 compared to 2010; CI 95% 76-82%) more rapidly than vivax incidence (by 19% in 2014 compared to 2010; CI 95% 5-32%). There were ten to 16 significant spatial clusters each year. Big clusters tended to extend along the Cambodian-Vietnamese border and along the Sesan River. Three clusters appeared throughout all years (2010-2014): one with 21 villages appeared each year, the second shrunk progressively from 2012 to 2014 and the third was split into two smaller clusters in 2013 and 2014. The decline of malaria burden can be attributed to intensive malaria control activities implemented in the areas: distribution of a long-lasting insecticidal net per person and early diagnosis and prompt treatment. Dihydro-artemisinin piperaquine was the only first-line treatment for all malaria cases. No radical treatment with primaquine was provided for Plasmodium vivax cases, which could explain the slow decrease of P. vivax due to relapses. To achieve malaria elimination by 2025, priority should be given to the control of stable malaria clusters appearing over time.

28266114|t|Interaction of lifestyle, behaviour or systemic diseases with dental caries and periodontal diseases: consensus report of group 2 of the joint EFP/ORCA workshop on the boundaries between caries and periodontal diseases
28266114|a|Periodontal diseases and dental caries are the most common diseases of humans and the main cause of tooth loss. Both diseases can lead to nutritional compromise and negative impacts upon self-esteem and quality of life. As complex chronic diseases, they share common risk factors, such as a requirement for a pathogenic plaque biofilm, yet they exhibit distinct pathophysiologies. Multiple exposures contribute to their causal pathways, and susceptibility involves risk factors that are inherited (e.g. genetic variants), and those that are acquired (e.g. socio-economic factors, biofilm load or composition, smoking, carbohydrate intake). Identification of these factors is crucial in the prevention of both diseases as well as in their management. To systematically appraise the scientific literature to identify potential risk factors for caries and periodontal diseases. One systematic review (genetic risk factors), one narrative review (role of diet and nutrition) and reference documentation for modifiable acquired risk factors common to both disease groups, formed the basis of the report. There is moderately strong evidence for a genetic contribution to periodontal diseases and caries susceptibility, with an attributable risk estimated to be up to 50%. The genetics literature for periodontal disease is more substantial than for caries and genes associated with chronic periodontitis are the vitamin D receptor (VDR), Fc gamma receptor IIA (Fc-γRIIA) and Interleukin 10 (IL10) genes. For caries, genes involved in enamel formation (AMELX, AMBN, ENAM, TUFT, MMP20, and KLK4), salivary characteristics (AQP5), immune regulation and dietary preferences had the largest impact. No common genetic variants were found. Fermentable carbohydrates (sugars and starches) were the most relevant common dietary risk factor for both diseases, but associated mechanisms differed. In caries, the fermentation process leads to acid production and the generation of biofilm components such as Glucans. In periodontitis, glycaemia drives oxidative stress and advanced glycation end-products may also trigger a hyper inflammatory state. Micronutrient deficiencies, such as for vitamin C, vitamin D or vitamin B12, may be related to the onset and progression of both diseases. Functional foods or probiotics could be helpful in caries prevention and periodontal disease management, although evidence is limited and biological mechanisms not fully elucidated. Hyposalivation, rheumatoid arthritis, smoking/tobacco use, undiagnosed or sub-optimally controlled diabetes and obesity are common acquired risk factors for both caries and periodontal diseases.

28266884|t|Intestinal micropatches for oral insulin delivery
28266884|a|Diabetes mellitus has become a major public health issue that has almost reached epidemic proportions worldwide. Injectable insulin has been typically utilized for the management of this chronic disease. However, lack of patient compliance with injectable formulations has spurred the development of oral insulin formulations, which although appealing, face several delivery challenges. We have developed novel mucoadhesive intestinal patches, several hundred micrometers in dimension (micropatches) that address the challenges of oral insulin delivery. The micropatches adhere to the intestinal mucosa, release their drug load rapidly within 30 min and are effective in lowering blood glucose levels in vivo. When insulin -loaded micropatches were administered with a permeation enhancer and protease inhibitor, a peak efficacy of 34% drop in blood glucose levels was observed within 3 h. Efficacy further improved to 41% when micropatches were administered in multiple doses. Here, we describe the design of micropatches as an oral insulin formulation and report their in vivo efficacy.

28269523|t|Hybrid automata models of cardiac ventricular electrophysiology for real-time computational applications
28269523|a|Virtual heart models have been proposed for closed loop validation of safety - critical embedded medical devices, such as pacemakers. These models must react in real-time to off-the-shelf medical devices. Real-time performance can be obtained by implementing models in computer hardware, and methods of compiling classes of Hybrid Automata (HA) onto FPGA have been developed. Models of ventricular cardiac cell electrophysiology have been described using HA which capture the complex nonlinear behavior of biological systems. However, many models that have been used for closed-loop validation of pacemakers are highly abstract and do not capture important characteristics of the dynamic rate response. We developed a new HA model of cardiac cells which captures dynamic behavior and we implemented the model in hardware. This potentially enables modeling the heart with over 1 million dynamic cells, making the approach ideal for closed loop testing of medical devices.

28269731|t|Comparison of pulse wave velocity derived from accelerometer and reflective photo-plethysmography signals placed at the carotid and femoral artery
28269731|a|Carotid - femoral pulse wave velocity is an established measure to assess cardiovascular risk and an interesting surrogate parameter towards non-invasive continuous blood pressure inference. Due to progress in sensing technologies for wearable wrist worn sensors, there are low cost sensor combinations of photo-plethysmography and high fidelity accelerometer s available offering access to pulse information from larger arteries complemented by blood volume changes in the superficial tissue. In this work we compare pulse wave velocities derived from accelerometer and reflective photo-plethysmography signals placed at the carotid and femoral artery. We discuss the different underlying physiological processes for the two sensing principles and present experimental results obtained in a study with healthy subjects.

28270328|t|Constructive and Unproductive Processing of Traumatic Experiences in Trauma-Focused Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Youth
28270328|a|Although there is substantial evidence to support the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral treatments (CBT) for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), there is some debate about how these treatments have their effects. Modern learning theory and cognitive and emotional processing theories highlight the importance of reducing avoidance, facilitating the constructive processing of feared experiences, and strengthening new inhibitory learning. We examined variables thought to be associated with unproductive and constructive processing of traumatic experiences in a sample of 81 youth with elevated PTSD symptoms, who received Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) for abuse or traumatic interpersonal loss. Sessions during the trauma narrative phase of TF-CBT were coded for indicators of unproductive processing (overgeneralization, rumination, avoidance) and constructive processing (decentering, accommodation of corrective information), as well as levels of negative emotion. In previous analyses of this trial (Ready et al., 2015), more overgeneralization during the narrative phase predicted less improvement in internalizing symptoms at posttreatment and a worsening of externalizing symptoms over the 12-month follow-up. In contrast, more accommodation predicted improvement in internalizing symptoms and also moderated the negative effects of overgeneralization on internalizing and externalizing symptoms. The current study examined correlates of overgeneralization and accommodation. Overgeneralization was associated with more rumination, less decentering, and more negative emotion, suggesting immersion in trauma -related material. Accommodation was associated with less avoidance and more decentering, suggesting a healthy distance from trauma -related material that might allow for processing and cognitive change. Decentering also predicted improvement in externalizing symptoms at posttreatment. Rumination and avoidance showed important associations with overgeneralization and accommodation, respectively, but did not predict treatment outcomes. This study identifies correlates of overgeneralization and accommodation that might shed light on how these variables relate to unproductive and constructive processing of traumatic experiences.

28274612|t|Effects of obesity on IL-33 / ST2 system in heart, adipose tissue and liver: study in the experimental model of Zucker rats
28274612|a|Suppression of tumorigenicity 2 (ST2) mediates the effect of Interleukin-33 (IL-33). Few data are reported on the relationship between IL-33 / ST2 and obesity. We aimed to investigate effects of obesity on IL-33 / ST2 system in heart, adipose tissue and liver in a rodent model of obesity. The relationship of cardiac expression of IL-33 / ST2 system with natriuretic peptides (NPs) system and inflammatory mediators was also studied. mRNA expression of IL-33 / ST2 system was evaluated in cardiac, adipose and hepatic biopsies from obese Zucker rats (O) and controls (CO). Expression levels of sST2 was significantly lower in O rats compared with CO (p<0.05) in all tissues. Besides, the mRNA levels of IL-33 decreased significant in fat of O respect to CO, while, expression levels of ST2L was significantly higher in liver of CO than in O. A strong relationship of IL-33 / ST2 with NPs and classical inflammatory mediators was observed in cardiac tissue. Expression of sST2 in cardiac, adipose and liver tissue decreased in O compared with controls, suggesting an involvement for IL-33 / ST2 system in molecular mechanisms of obesity. The strong relationships with NP systems and inflammatory mediators could suggest an involvement for IL-33 / ST2 in molecular pathways leading to cardiac dysfunction and inflammation associated with obesity.

28277316|t|CXCL14 - CXCR4 and CXCL12 - CXCR4 Axes May Play Important Roles in the Unique Invasion Process of Endometrioid Carcinoma With MELF-Pattern Myoinvasion
28277316|a|The term " MELF-pattern myometrial invasion " (MELF pattern) denotes an unusual morphology of myometrial invasion in endometrioid carcinomas, and is associated with frequent lymphovascular invasion and lymph node metastasis. In this study, tumor cells were directly collected from a MELF pattern site, using laser microdissection. Comprehensive microarray analysis of the genes was conducted, and based on the results, expression of a metastasis progression gene, CXCR4, and its ligands CXCL14 and CXCL12, was further investigated. In vitro studies of endometrioid carcinoma cell lines revealed elevated invasion activity in a manner dependent on the CXCL14 - CXCR4 or CXCL12 - CXCR4 axis. Immunohistochemical analysis of 93 (MELF group, 46; non-MELF group, 47) cases illustrated CXCR4 was expressed in all endometrioid carcinomas, while based on CXCL14 and CXCL12 expression score, high proportions of cells were positive at the sites of the MELF pattern (P<0.01). There was no significant difference in progression-free survival or overall survival between MELF group and non-MELF group by Kaplan-Meier analysis. These findings suggest a possibility that cells at the sites of MELF pattern had acquired increased invasiveness through the function of the CXCL14 - CXCR4 and CXCL12 - CXCR4 axes.

28277879|t|Crude 4-methylcyclohexanemethanol (MCHM) did not cause skin irritation in humans in 48-h patch test
28277879|a|Crude 4-methylcyclohexanemethanol (MCHM) is an industrial chemical used to wash and clean coal. On January 9th, 2014 approximately 10,000 gallons of a mixture containing crude MCHM were released into the Elk River near Charleston, West Virginia, contaminating the local water supply. Following the spill, residents reported numerous health complaints, and sought medical attention for ailments including rashes and itching. The relationship between the complaints and the spill were unknown, as such symptoms are reported frequently in the background. In this study, the primary irritation potential of crude MCHM was evaluated in 206 individuals who underwent 48 hour semi-occluded patch testing. MCHM concentrations assessed in this study were 1, 5, 15, and 100 ppm. No appreciable skin reactions were observed in individuals at any concentration. Three of the five concentrations evaluated were above the highest measured concentration of MCHM in the tap water of residents in West Virginia (3.7 ppm). The results of this study suggest that crude MCHM would not be a dermal irritant for the vast majority, if not all, potentially exposed persons at the concentrations in the water reported after the spill.

28278674|t|New metabolites from the sponge -derived fungus Aspergillus sydowii J05B-7F-4
28278674|a|Two new metabolites, diorcinolic acid (1) and β-d-glucopyranosyl aspergillusene A (8), together with six diphenylethers (2-7), a diketopiperazine (9), a chromone (10) and a xanthone (11) were isolated from the fungus Aspergillus sydowii derived from the marine sponge Stelletta sp. The planar structures and their relative configurations were elucidated by analysing 1D, 2D NMR and HRESIMS data. Compound 8 is the first glycoside of phenolic bisabolane sesquiterpenes. Compounds 1 and 8 exhibited mild cytotoxicity against KB (human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells), HepG2 (human liver cancer cells) and HCT 116 (human colon cancer cells). All compounds were evaluated for antibacterial activity and their abilities to suppress LPS -induced nitric oxide (NO) production. Compounds 2 and 4-7 showed mild antibacterial activity against human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus and fish pathogens Streptococcus iniae and Vibrio ichthyoenteri, and compounds 4 and 7 weakly suppressed NO production.

28279706|t|The neural legacy of a single concussion
28279706|a|It has been hypothesized that concussions impart lasting brain damage, even after a patient has ostensibly recovered. This hypothesis is based largely upon neuropathological studies in deceased athletes, however, leaving open the question of whether it can be detected in vivo. We measured neural responses to speech in collegiate student - athletes with a history of a single concussion from which they had recovered. These student - athletes had weaker responses to speech than age - and position - matched peers. This group difference suggests that concussions engender small, but detectable, changes in brain function prior to the emergence of frank behavioral indications.

28281265|t|Enhanced Performance of Colorimetric Biosensing on Paper Microfluidic Platforms Through Chemical Modification and Incorporation of Nanoparticles
28281265|a|This chapter describes two different methodologies used to improve the analytical performance of colorimetric paper -based biosensors. Microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (μPADs) have been produced by a stamping process and CO2 laser ablation and modified, respectively, through an oxidation step and incorporation of silica nanoparticles on the paper structure. Both methods are employed in order to overcome the largest problem associated with colorimetric detection, the heterogeneity of the color distribution in the detection zones. The modification steps are necessary to improve the interaction between the paper surface and the selected enzymes. The enhanced performance has ensured reliability for quantitative analysis of clinically relevant compounds.

28282510|t|CXCR4 (CD184) expression on stem cell harvest and CD34(+) cells post-transplant
28282510|a|CXCR4 is a receptor for stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), a molecule that has a chemotactic activity for lymphocytes and is important in homing of hematopoietic stem cells to their adult marrow. We evaluated the CXCR4 (CD184) expression in the harvest cells and in the post-transplant bone marrow (BM) and its relation to engraftment, as determined by the consensus criteria and chimerism. This is a prospective study which included 30 patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; 15 patients received autograft and 15 patients received allograft on dates between January 2012 and May 2014. We assessed CD184 (CXCR4) using flow cytometry in the harvest cells together with post-transplant BM assessment on Day 28 and Day 90 for complete morphologic, molecular studies, and detection of CD184 expression on CD34(+) cells with chimerism studies on total peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Diagnoses of the enrolled patients were as follows: seven (24.1%) with acute myeloid leukemia, eight (27.6%) with multiple myeloma, four (13.8%) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, three (10.3%) with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, two (6.9%) with myelodysplastic syndromes, two (6.9%) with aplastic anemia, two (6.9%) with chronic myeloid leukemia, one (3.4%) with Hodgkin lymphoma, and one (3.4%) with plasmacytomas. One patient died and was excluded from the study because there were not enough data about engraftment. There was no statistical significance between the level of CD184 in stem cell harvest and the prediction of successful engraftment (p>0.05) as well as in Day 28 BM sample (p>0.05), whereas there was a statistical significance between the level of CD184 in Day 90 BM sample and the occurrence of successful engraftment (p=0.002). SDF-1 / CXCR4 axis plays a crucial role in engraftment; however, more studies are warranted to assess their expression post-transplant. Evaluating the ligand (chemokine, SDF-1) or its receptor (CXCR4) may serve as potential surrogate markers for assessment of engraftment.

28284223|t|Genetic diversity of Taenia saginata (Cestoda: Cyclophyllidea) from Lao People's Democratic Republic and northeastern Thailand based on mitochondrial DNA
28284223|a|Taenia saginata is a tapeworm found in cattle worldwide. Analysis of genetic diversity in different geographical populations of T. saginata not only helps to understand the origin, transmission and spread of this organism, but also to evaluate the selection pressures acting on T. saginata and how it is responding to them. However, there are few reports of the genetic variability of T. saginata populations in different regions of the world, including Lao PDR and Thailand. We report the genetic diversity of T. saginata populations in Lao PDR and northeastern Thailand together with sequences of T. saginata from other countries deposited in GenBank. Mitochondrial cox1 sequence analysis revealed that 15 and 8 haplotypes were identified in 30 and 21 T. saginata isolates from Lao PDR and northeastern Thailand, respectively. Fifty-three haplotypes were identified from 98 sequences. Phylogenetic tree and haplotype network analyses revealed that global isolates of T. saginata were genetically divided into five groups (A, B, C1, C2 and D). Taenia saginata isolates from Lao PDR and northeastern Thailand belonged to either Group A or B. Taenia saginata from western Thailand clustered in groups C1, C2 and D, and populations from the northeast and western Thailand were found to be genetically distinct. Taenia saginata isolates in Lao PDR and Thailand were also found to be genetically diverse but the degree of genetic differentiation was low. Taenia saginata populations from Lao PDR and northeastern Thailand are genetically distinct from the population in western Thailand and it is proposed that T. saginata has been dispersed by different transmission routes in Southeast Asia.

28284864|t|Development of a novel near-infrared fluorescent theranostic combretastain A-4 analogue, YK-5-252, to target triple negative breast cancer
28284864|a|The treatment of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a significant challenge to cancer research. The lack of hormone receptors limits the treatment options available to patients with this diagnosis, forcing them to endure prolonged radiation and chemotherapy. Anti-angiogenesis is a chemotherapeutic strategy that targets the vasculature of tumors. Combretastatin A-4 (CA-4) is a well-known vasculature - disrupting agent, which has been shown to effectively kill a variety of cancers through inhibition of tubulin polymerization. Due to its toxicity, small molecule analogues of CA-4 have been sought out. We have designed a novel dual action CA-4 prodrug, YK-5-252, which releases the drug through a disulfide bond cleavage mechanism and contains a near-infrared (NIR) fluorophore, which allows fluorescence monitoring of cleavage. This disulfide linkage causes CA-4 to become effective only when released by glutathione (GSH) reducing the toxicity of the drug while simultaneously releasing the NIR fluorophore. Therefore the prodrug, YK-5-252, represents a novel CA-4 analogue which has reduced toxicity and can be used for theranostics imaging.

28288758|t|Epidemiological patterns of bovine besnoitiosis in an endemic beef cattle herd reared under extensive conditions
28288758|a|Bovine besnoitiosis is a parasitic disease caused by the protozoan Besnoitia besnoiti. Described many decades ago, recent epidemiological studies reveal its important spread within Europe in the last years. To date, many epidemiological aspects related to life cycle, routes of transmission, incidence rates and associated risk factors are lacking; hence, the establishment of appropriate disease control programmes poses an important challenge. Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine the epidemiological pattern of the disease in an endemic herd reared under extensive conditions (Spanish Pyrenees) by identifying main factors associated with infection and clinical disease dynamics. The study population consisted of 276 Brown Swiss and Pirenaica adult animals and 145 calves born and weaned at the farm during the study. Three sampling time frames were used: January 2010, September 2010 and February 2011, which allowed us to differentiate two periods designated as mountain and valley periods. The data related to animals (breed, sex and age) and herd management (animal grouping and time in housing) were recorded. The data collection methodology was mainly based on clinical examinations and defining the serological status against bovine besnoitiosis by the immunofluorescent antibody testing of blood samples. The total prevalence among adult animals was 38.34% (CI 95%: 34.53-42.07), with 18.54% of seropositive animals showing clinical signs. In regard to the cumulative incidence, 34.57% of new infections were detected during the mountain period, in contrast to the 24.59% observed in the valley period. The incidence density was 0.058 and 0.061 new infections per animal - month for the mountain and valley periods, respectively. According to the seroepidemiological study, the seroconversion probability of B. besnoiti infection was directly associated with the number of seropositive cows with whom an animal had been stabled as well as the housing period duration, supporting horizontal transmission by close contact as one of the most important methods of disease spread. In addition, the risk of developing the clinical course increased with age, and the presence of clinical signs was related to higher antibody responses. Among calves (from 3.1 to 7.1 months old) sampled once at weaning, the total seroprevalence was 15.17% (CI 95%: 9.36-21.04), and the chronic stage was observed in three animals, supporting the ability of B. besnoiti to infect and even cause disease in animals less than 6 months old. Finally, the risk of calf seroconversion was positively related to the serological status of the cows, suggesting postnatal transmission between dams and offspring by contact during the suckling period.

28295177|t|A fast small-sample kernel independence test for microbiome community - level association analysis
28295177|a|To fully understand the role of microbiome in human health and diseases, researchers are increasingly interested in assessing the relationship between microbiome composition and host genomic data. The dimensionality of the data as well as complex relationships between microbiota and host genomics pose considerable challenges for analysis. In this article, we apply a kernel RV coefficient (KRV) test to evaluate the overall association between host gene expression and microbiome composition. The KRV statistic can capture nonlinear correlations and complex relationships among the individual data types and between gene expression and microbiome composition through measuring general dependency. Testing proceeds via a similar route as existing tests of the generalized RV coefficients and allows for rapid p-value calculation. Strategies to allow adjustment for confounding effects, which is crucial for avoiding misleading results, and to alleviate the problem of selecting the most favorable kernel are considered. Simulation studies show that KRV is useful in testing statistical independence with finite samples given the kernels are appropriately chosen, and can powerfully identify existing associations between microbiome composition and host genomic data while protecting type I error. We apply the KRV to a microbiome study examining the relationship between host transcriptome and microbiome composition within the context of inflammatory bowel disease and are able to derive new biological insights and provide formal inference on prior qualitative observations.

28295357|t|An Analysis of Systematic Elemental Changes in Decomposing Bone
28295357|a|The aim of this pilot study was to investigate compositional changes in bone during decomposition. Elemental concentrations of barium, calcium, iron, potassium, magnesium, zinc and phosphorus in porcine bone (as an experimental analog for human bone) were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). The samples were taken from porcine bone subjected to shallow burial and surface depositions at 28- day intervals for a period of 140 days. Results indicated that ICP-OES elemental profiling has potential to be developed as a forensic test for determining whether a bone sample originates from the early stages of soft tissue putrefaction. Significant changes in iron, sodium and potassium concentrations were found over 140 days. These elements are known to be primarily associated with proteins and/or tissue fluids within the bone. Changes in their respective concentrations may therefore be linked to dehydration over time and in turn may be indicative of time since deposition.

28295838|a|Reconstructing the origin of a polyploid species is particularly challenging when an ancestor has become extinct. Under such circumstances, the extinct donor of a genome found in the polyploid may be treated as a 'ghost' species in that its prior existence is recognized through the presence of its genome in the polyploid. In this study, we aimed to determine the polyploid origin of Oxyria sinensis (2n = 40) for which only one congeneric species is known, that is diploid O. digyna (2n = 14). Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), transcriptome, phylogenetic and demographic analyses, and ecological niche modelling were conducted for this purpose. GISH revealed that O. sinensis comprised 14 chromosomes from O. digyna and 26 chromosomes from an unknown ancestor. Transcriptome analysis indicated that following divergence from O. digyna, involving genome duplication around 12 million years ago (Ma), a second genome duplication occurred approximately 6 Ma to give rise to O. sinensis. Oxyria sinensis was shown to contain homologous gene sequences divergent from those present in O. digyna in addition to a set that clustered with those in O. digyna. Coalescent simulations indicated that O. sinensis expanded its distribution approximately 6-7 Ma, possibly following the second polyploidization event, whereas O. digyna expanded its range much later. It was also indicated that the distributions of both species contracted and re-expanded during the Pleistocene climatic oscillations. Ecological niche modelling similarly suggested that both species experienced changes in their distributional ranges in response to Quaternary climatic changes. The extinction of the unknown 'ghost' tetraploid species implicated in the origin of O. sinensis could have resulted from superior adaptation of O. sinensis to repeated climatic changes in the region where it now occurs.

28296680|t|Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumors of the Female Genital Tract: A Morphologic, Immunohistochemical, and Molecular Study of 19 Cases
28296680|a|Primary primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) of the female genital tract is rare, and its proper classification remains unclear. The clinical, histologic, and immunophenotypic features as well as EWSR1 rearrangement status of 19 gynecologic PNETs, including 10 ovarian, 8 uterine, and 1 vulvar tumors, are herein reported. Patient age ranged from 12 to 68 years, with a median age of 20 and 51 years among those with ovarian and uterine PNETs, respectively. Morphologic features of central nervous system (CNS) tumors were seen in 15 PNETs, including 9 medulloblastomas, 3 ependymomas, 2 medulloepitheliomas, and 1 glioblastoma, consistent with central PNET. The remaining 4 PNETs were composed entirely of undifferentiated small round blue cells and were classified as Ewing sarcoma/peripheral PNET. Eight PNETs were associated with another tumor type, including 5 ovarian mature cystic teratomas, 2 endometrial low-grade endometrioid carcinomas, and a uterine carcinosarcoma. By immunohistochemistry, 17 PNETs expressed at least 1 marker of neuronal differentiation, including synaptophysin, NSE, CD56, S100, and chromogranin in 10, 8, 14, 8, and 1 tumors, respectively. GFAP was positive in 4 PNETs, all of which were of central type. Membranous CD99 and nuclear Fli-1 staining was seen in 10 and 16 tumors, respectively, and concurrent expression of both markers was seen in both central and Ewing sarcoma/peripheral PNET s. All tumors expressed vimentin, whereas keratin cocktail (CAM5.2, AE1/AE3) staining was only focally present in 4 PNETs. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was successful in all cases and confirmed EWSR1 rearrangement in 2 of 4 tumors demonstrating morphologic features of Ewing sarcoma/peripheral PNET and concurrent CD99 and Fli-1 expression. In conclusion, central and Ewing sarcoma/peripheral PNETs may be encountered in the female genital tract with central PNETs being more common. Central PNETs show a spectrum of morphologic features that overlaps with CNS tumors but lack EWSR1 rearrangement s. GFAP expression supports a morphologic impression of central PNET and is absent in Ewing sarcoma/peripheral PNET. Ewing sarcoma/peripheral PNETs lack morphologic features of CNS tumors.

28297577|t|Surgical Excision of Heterotopic Ossification Leads to Re-Emergence of Mesenchymal Stem Cell Populations Responsible for Recurrence
28297577|a|Trauma-induced heterotopic ossification (HO) occurs after severe musculoskeletal injuries and burns, and presents a significant barrier to patient rehabilitation. Interestingly, the incidence of HO significantly increases with repeated operations and after resection of previous HO. Treatment of established heterotopic ossification is challenging because surgical excision is often incomplete, with evidence of persistent heterotopic bone. As a result, patients may continue to report the signs or symptoms of HO, including chronic pain, nonhealing wounds, and joint restriction. In this study, we designed a model of recurrent HO that occurs after surgical excision of mature HO in a mouse model of hind-limb Achilles' tendon transection with dorsal burn injury. We first demonstrated that key signaling mediators of HO, including bone morphogenetic protein signaling, are diminished in mature bone. However, upon surgical excision, we have noted upregulation of downstream mediators of osteogenic differentiation, including pSMAD 1 / 5. Additionally, surgical excision resulted in re-emergence of a mesenchymal cell population marked by expression of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α (PDGFRα) and present in the initial developing HO lesion but absent in mature HO. In the recurrent lesion, these PDGFRα + mesenchymal cells are also highly proliferative, similar to the initial developing HO lesion. These findings indicate that surgical excision of HO results in recurrence through similar mesenchymal cell populations and signaling mechanisms that are present in the initial developing HO lesion. These results are consistent with findings in patients that new foci of ectopic bone can develop in excision sites and are likely related to de novo formation rather than extension of unresected bone.

28298171|t|Extended release of flurbiprofen from tromethamine - buffered HPMC hydrophilic matrix tablets
28298171|a|The pH - dependent solubility of a drug can lead to pH - dependent drug release from hydrophilic matrix tablets. Adding buffer salts to the formulation to attempt to mitigate this can impair matrix hydration and negatively impact drug release. An evaluation of the buffering of hydrophilic matrix tablets containing a pH - dependent solubility weak acid drug (flurbiprofen), identified as possessing a deleterious effect on hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) solubility, swelling and gelation, with respect to drug dissolution and the characteristics of the hydrophilic matrix gel layer in the presence of tromethamine as a buffer was undertaken. The inclusion of tromethamine as an alkalizing agent afforded pH - independent flurbiprofen release from matrices based on both HPMC 2910 (E series) and 2208 (K series), while concomitantly decreasing the apparent critical effect on dissolution mediated by this drug with respect to the early pseudo-gel layer formation and functionality. Drug release profiles were unaffected by matrix pH-changes resulting from loss of tromethamine over time, suggesting that HPMC inhibited precipitation of drug from supersaturated solution in the hydrated matrix. We propose that facilitation of diffusion-based release of potentially deleterious drugs in hydrophilic matrices may be achieved through judicious selection of a buffering species.

28299515|t|The influence of slope on Spartium junceum root system: morphological, anatomical and biomechanical adaptation
28299515|a|Root systems have a pivotal role in plant anchorage and their mechanical interactions with the soil may contribute to soil reinforcement and stabilization of slide-prone slopes. In order to understand the responses of root system to mechanical stress induced by slope, samples of Spartium junceum L., growing in slope and in plane natural conditions, were compared in their morphology, biomechanical properties and anatomical features. Soils sampled in slope and plane revealed similar characteristics, with the exception of organic matter content and penetrometer resistance, both higher in slope. Slope significantly influenced root morphology and in particular the distribution of lateral roots along the soil depth. Indeed, first-order lateral roots of plants growing on slope condition showed an asymmetric distribution between up- and down-slope. Contrarily, this asymmetric distribution was not observed in plants growing in plane. The tensile strength was higher in lateral roots growing up-slope and in plane conditions than in those growing down-slope. Anatomical investigations revealed that, while roots grown up-slope had higher area covered by xylem fibers, the ratio of xylem and phloem fibers to root diameter did not differ among the three conditions, as also, no differences were found for xylem fiber cell wall thickness. Roots growing up-slope were the main contributors to anchorage properties, which included higher strength and higher number of fibers in the xylematic tissues. Results suggested that a combination of root - specific morphological, anatomical and biomechanical traits, determines anchorage functions in slope conditions.

28299817|t|Altered expression of the Olr59, Ethe1, and Slc10a2 genes in the liver of F344 rats by neonatal thyroid hormone disruption
28299817|a|Many concerns have been expressed regarding the possible adverse effects of thyroid hormone-disrupting chemicals in the environment. The disruption of thyroid hormones in the neonatal period may lead to permanent effects on thyroid hormone homeostasis as well as related developmental disorders, as thyroid hormones are essential for regulating the growth and differentiation of many tissues. To understand the long-term alteration in gene expressions by neonatal administration of thyroid hormone -like chemicals in general, we identified genes whose expression was altered in the liver, an important component of the thyroid hormone axis, by neonatal exposure to triiodothyronine (T3). T3 was administered to male F344 rats on postnatal days 1, 3, and 5 (week 0). At 8 weeks of age, cDNA microarray analysis was used to identify hepatic genes whose expression was altered by neonatal exposure to T3. Among the up-regulated genes that were identified, the expression of Olr59, Ethe1, and Slc10a2 increased specifically in rats neonatally exposed to T3. Interestingly, altered hepatic expression of these genes indeed increased when a hydroxylated polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE), OH-BDE42, which is capable of binding to the TR, was given neonatally. Our data demonstrated that neonatal exposure to thyroid hormones could affect the long-term expression of the genes, which could be useful markers for neonatal effects by thyroid hormone - disrupting chemicals.

Longitudinal means and covariance structure analyses showed that applicants ' response processes could be partially reproduced after half a year, and respondents seemed to rely on an honest response behavior as a frame of reference. Additionally, applicants ' faking behavior and instructed faking (faking-good) caused differences in the latent retest correlations and consistently affected measurement properties. The varying latent retest correlations indicated that faking can distort respondents ' rank-order and thus the fairness of subsequent selection decisions, depending on the kind of faking behavior. Instructed faking (faking-good) even affected weak measurement invariance, whereas applicants ' faking behavior did not. Consequently, correlations with personality scales -which can be utilized for predictive validity -may be readily interpreted for applicants. Faking behavior also introduced a uniform bias, implying that the classically observed mean raw score differences may not be readily interpreted.

28303067|t|Intraspinal meningioma with malignant transformation and distant metastasis
28303067|a|Meningioma is typically considered to be a benign tumor. Malignant transformation and metastasis of meningiomas are rare. Moreover, most meningiomas are intracranial, and there are few reports on intraspinal meningiomas. This report aimed to describe the clinical features and pathological findings of a case of malignant transformation and distant metastasis of intraspinal meningioma, with a review of the literature. A 44-year-old man with a bilateral lower limb paresis was diagnosed with an intradural extramedullary tumor of the thoracic spine. Primary tumor resection was performed, and the histological findings revealed atypical meningioma. The meningioma recurred 2 years after the primary surgery, and a second resection was performed, but only partial resection was possible because of decreased motor evoked potential. At age 48, the patient's lower limb weakness returned, and a third resection was performed, and the histological finding remained atypical meningioma. At age 54, the tumor increased and stereotactic irradiation was performed. At age 60, the patient was diagnosed with metastatic tumors of the rib, lumbar vertebra, cervical spine, and sacrum. Biopsy of the rib metastatic tumor was performed, and the histological findings revealed anaplastic meningioma. This case is the first report of an intraspinal meningioma that transformed from atypical to anaplastic meningioma with distant hematogenous metastasis.

28303341|t|Epidemiology and risk factors associated with surgical site infection after different types of hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgery
28303341|a|Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most common healthcare-associated infections (HAIs); however, SSI after hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgery (HBPS) has not been well investigated in a large cohort of patients. This study analyzed the factors associated with SSI following HBPS in Japan, using a Japanese national database. Data on HBPS performed between 2012 and 2014 were extracted from a national monitoring system for HAI: The Japan Nosocomial Infections Surveillance. Using multivariate logistic regression, I assessed the factors associated with SSI. The cumulative incidence of SSI following HBPS was 15.6% (2873/18,398). The incidence of SSI after pancreatoduodenectomy was 28.0%, which was significantly higher than that after liver resection and other types of HBPS (8.8 and 15.5%, respectively). Among the four traditional risk factors, the American Society of Anesthesiologists score was ineffective for predicting SSI in the final model of all three types of surgery. Additional risk factors were identified, including age and male gender. The incidence of and factors associated with SSI after the three types of HBPS analyzed differed significantly. To accurately compare hospital performance in relation to SSI following HBPS, the operative procedure category in the surveillance system must be divided into three types.

28303942|t|Signature of an aggregation - prone conformation of tau
28303942|a|The self-assembly of the microtubule associated tau protein into fibrillar cell inclusions is linked to a number of devastating neurodegenerative disorders collectively known as tauopathies. The mechanism by which tau self-assembles into pathological entities is a matter of much debate, largely due to the lack of direct experimental insights into the earliest stages of aggregation. We present pulsed double electron-electron resonance measurements of two key fibril - forming regions of tau, PHF6 and PHF6*, in transient as aggregation happens. By monitoring the end-to-end distance distribution of these segments as a function of aggregation time, we show that the PHF6((*)) regions dramatically extend to distances commensurate with extended β-strand structures within the earliest stages of aggregation, well before fibril formation. Combined with simulations, our experiments show that the extended β-strand conformational state of PHF6((*)) is readily populated under aggregating conditions, constituting a defining signature of aggregation - prone tau, and as such, a possible target for therapeutic interventions.

28304102|t|Design, Synthesis, and Cytotoxic Evaluation of Certain 7-Chloro-4-(piperazin-1-yl)quinoline Derivatives as VEGFR-II Inhibitors
28304102|a|Signaling pathway inhibition of VEGFR-II is visualized as valuable tool in cancer management. In the current study, the synthesis of novel 1-4-(7-chloroquinolin-4-yl)piperazin-1-yl)-2-(N-substituted-amino)-ethanone derivatives (4a-t) was achieved through the amination of 2-chloro-1-(4-(7-chloroquinolin-4-yl)piperazin-1-yl)ethanone (3) with different secondary amines. The structures of the target compounds were confirmed by IR, (1) H-NMR, (13) C-NMR, HRMS, and microanalysis. Compounds 4a-t were subjected to in vitro anticancer screening against human breast cancer (MCF-7) and prostate cancer (PC3) cell lines. The highest cytotoxicty against both cell lines was displayed by 2-(4-(4-bromobenzyl)piperazin-1-yl)-1-(4-(7-chloroquinolin-4-yl)piperazin-1-yl)ethanone (4q), with IC50 values of 6.502 and 11.751 μM against MCF-7 and PC3 cells, respectively, compared with the standard drug doxorubicin (MCF-7: 6.774 μM, PC3: 7.7316 μM). Due to its notable activity toward MCF-7 cells, 4q was further evaluated as VEGFR-II inhibitor, showing an IC50 of 1.38 μM compared to sorafenib (0.33 μM). The docking study proved that 4q has a binding mode akin to that of VEGFR-II inhibitors.

28304405|t|The ErbB3 receptor tyrosine kinase negatively regulates Paneth cells by PI3K - dependent suppression of Atoh1
28304405|a|Paneth cells (PCs), a secretory population located at the base of the intestinal crypt, support the intestinal stem cells (ISC) with growth factors and participate in innate immunity by releasing antimicrobial peptides, including lysozyme and defensins. PC dysfunction is associated with disorders such as Crohn's disease and necrotizing enterocolitis, but the specific pathways regulating PC development and function are not fully understood. Here we tested the role of the neuregulin receptor ErbB3 in control of PC differentiation and the ISC niche. Intestinal epithelial ErbB3 knockout caused precocious appearance of PCs as early as postnatal day 7, and substantially increased the number of mature PCs in adult mouse ileum. ErbB3 loss had no effect on other secretory lineages, but increased expression of the ISC marker Lgr5. ErbB3 -null intestines had elevated levels of the Atoh1 transcription factor, which is required for secretory fate determination, while Atoh1(+) cells had reduced ErbB3, suggesting reciprocal negative regulation. ErbB3 -null intestinal progenitor cells showed reduced activation of the PI3K-Akt and ERK MAPK pathways. Inhibiting these pathways in HT29 cells increased levels of ATOH1 and the PC marker LYZ. Conversely, ErbB3 activation suppressed LYZ and ATOH1 in a PI3K - dependent manner. Expansion of the PC compartment in ErbB3 -null intestines was accompanied with elevated ER stress and inflammation markers, raising the possibility that negative regulation of PCs by ErbB3 is necessary to maintain homeostasis. Taken together, our data suggest that ErbB3 restricts PC numbers through PI3K -mediated suppression of Atoh1 levels leading to inhibition of PC differentiation, with important implications for regulation of the ISC niche.

28306155|t|CDF - quantile distributions for modelling random variables on the unit interval
28306155|a|This paper introduces a two-parameter family of distributions for modelling random variables on the (0,1) interval by applying the cumulative distribution function of one ' parent' distribution to the quantile function of another. Family members have explicit probability density functions, cumulative distribution functions and quantile s in a location parameter and a dispersion parameter. They capture a wide variety of shapes that the beta and Kumaraswamy distributions cannot. They are amenable to likelihood inference, and enable a wide variety of quantile regression models, with predictors for both the location and dispersion parameters. We demonstrate their applicability to psychological research problems and their utility in modelling real data.

28314676|t|First and second generation DESs reduce diabetes adverse effect on mortality and re-intervention in multivessel coronary disease: 9- Year analysis
28314676|a|Diabetes portends an increased risk of adverse early and late outcomes in patients undergoing PCI. In this study, we aimed to investigate if the adverse effect of diabetes mellitus (DM) on early and late PCI outcomes is reduced with drug-eluting (DES) compared to bare-metal (BMS) stents. We reviewed the Mount Sinai Beth Israel Hospital first PCI experience for multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD, 1998-2009). Patients were excluded if they had single-vessel CAD, emergency, no stent, prior bypass graft or myocardial infarction <24h. Diabetes - effect was derived from 9- year all-cause mortality and re-intervention risk-adjusted hazard ratios [AHR (95% confidence intervals)] for DES (N=2679; 48% three-vessel; 39% DM) and BMS (N=2651; 40% three-vessel; 33% DM) and then stratified based on stent (DES / BMS) and vessel disease (two / three). Diabetes - effect on mortality was lower for DES (AHRDM/NoDM =1.41 [1.14-1.74]) versus BMS (AHRDM/NoDM =1.71 [1.50-2.01]), but this was predominantly driven by two-vessel patients. This diabetes effect was similar for first (DES1: AHRDM/NoDM =1.43 [1.14-1.79]) and second (DES2: AHRDM/NoDM =1.53 [0.77-3.07]) generation DES. Re-intervention comparisons were similarly increased by diabetes in all sub-cohorts. Our analysis of a large real-world PCI series indicates that diabetes is associated with worse 9- year mortality irrespective of stent type, albeit this is mitigated to varying degrees with DES, particularly in DES2 and in case of 2-vessel disease. A complementary stent - effect analysis confirmed DES -to- BMS and DES2 -to- DES1 superiority in both diabetics and non-diabetics.

28318092|t|Lycopene and risk of cardiovascular diseases: A meta-analysis of observational studies
28318092|a|The aim of current meta-analysis was to investigate the relation between lycopene and risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Studies concerning about the association between lycopene and risk of CVD were searched on Pubmed, Embase, and Web of Science from inception to October 2016. A total of 14 eligible studies were identified. A significantly inverse association with a pooled risk ratio (RR) of 0.83 (95% CI: 0.76-0.90) was shown between lycopene exposure and risk of CVD. Findings were similar restricting to dietary studies (RR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.79-0.96) and biomarker studies (RR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0. 62-0.87). Dietary lycopene intake was statistically significant for coronary heart disease (CHD) (RR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.76-0.98) and stroke (RR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.69-0.96).The pooled risk estimate was generally similar for lycopene biomarker concentrations, but the association was only statistically significant for stroke (RR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.42-0.87). Subgroup analyses showed that retrospective and low quality studies were statistically significant sources of heterogeneity. Higher lycopene exposure is inversely associated with a lower risk of CVD. Further well-designed randomized clinical trials are required to assess the role of lycopene on CVD.

28318300|t|Bacteria from Wheat and Cucurbit Plant Roots Metabolize PAHs and Aromatic Root Exudates: Implications for Rhizodegradation
28318300|a|The chemical interaction between plants and bacteria in the root zone can lead to soil decontamination. Bacteria which degrade PAHs have been isolated from the rhizospheres of plant species with varied biological traits, however, it is not known what phytochemicals promote contaminant degradation. One monocot and two dicotyledon plants were grown in PAH - contaminated soil from a manufactured gas plant (MGP) site. A phytotoxicity assay confirmed greater soil decontamination in rhizospheres when compared to bulk soil controls. Bacteria were isolated from plant roots (rhizobacteria) and selected for growth on anthracene and chrysene on PAH - amended plates. Rhizosphere isolates metabolized 3- and 4-ring PAHs and PAH catabolic intermediates in liquid incubations. Aromatic root exudate compounds, namely flavonoids and simple phenols, were also substrates for isolated rhizobacteria. In particular, the phenolic compounds - morin, caffeic acid, and protocatechuic acid - appear to be linked to bacterial degradation of 3- and 4- ring PAHs in the rhizosphere.

28319455|t|Joint model imputation to estimate the treatment effect on long-term survival using auxiliary events
28319455|a|Clinical trial duration may be a concern in clinical research, especially in cancer trials where the endpoint is overall survival. A surrogate endpoint can be used as an auxiliary variable to analyze the treatment effect earlier. At an early time point, the high number of censored observations can be compensated by the imputation of the unobserved deaths times. We propose to use predictions of the risk of death from a joint model for a recurrent event and a terminal event, which account for disease relapse information. Two imputation methods were compared: sampling from the estimated parametric distribution of the survival time and sampling using its nonparametric estimation. The treatment effect and its standard error were estimated via multiple imputations. The performances of the two methods were compared in terms of bias in the estimates, standard errors, and coverage probability. Both methods were then retrospectively applied to two randomized clinical trials studying the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients.

28319640|t|The Corneal Epithelial Barrier and Its Developmental Role in Isolating Corneal Epithelial and Conjunctival Cells From One Another
28319640|a|During development, the corneal epithelium (CE) and the conjunctiva are derived from the surface ectoderm. Here we have examined how, during development, the cells of these two issues become isolated from each other. Epithelia from the anterior eyes of chicken embryos were labeled with the fluorescent, lipophilic dye, 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI). DiI was placed on the epithelial surface of the developing anterior eye and its diffusion was monitored by fluorescence microscopy. Concomitant morphologic changes in the surface cells of these epithelial were examined by scanning electron microscopy. Immunofluorescence was used to analyze the expression of cytokeratin K3, ZO-1, N-cadherin and Connexin-43 and the function of gap junctions was analyzed using a cut-loading with the fluorescent dye rhodamine-dextran. Prior to embryonic day 8 (E 8), DiI placed on the surface of the CE spreads throughout all the epithelial cells of the anterior eye. When older eyes were similarly labeled, dye diffusion was restricted to the CE. Similarly, diffusion of DiI placed on the conjunctival surface after E 8 was restricted to the conjunctiva. Scanning electron microscopy showed that developmentally (1) physical separations progressively form between the cells of the CE and those of the conjunctiva, and (2) by E 8 these separations form a ring that completely encompasses the cornea. The functional restriction of gap junctions between these tissues did not occur until E 14. During ocular development, a barrier to the diffusion of DiI forms between the contiguous CE and conjunctiva prior to the differential expression of gap junctions within these tissues.

28321789|t|Longitudinal study of bovine rotavirus group A in newborn calves from vaccinated and unvaccinated dairy herds
28321789|a|Reports of rotavirus excretion in calves usually result from cross-sectional studies, and in face of the conflicting results regarding protection of calves born to vaccinated dams against diarrhea, the aim of the present study was to evaluate rotavirus excretion in dairy calves born to vaccinated or unvaccinated dams, to identify the genotypes of bovine rotavirus group A (RVA) strains isolated from these animals as well as to investigate characteristics of the disease in naturally occurring circumstances throughout the first month of life. Five hundred fifty-two fecal samples were taken from 56 calves, 28 from each farm and, in the vaccinated herd, 11/281 samples (3.91%) taken from six different calves tested positive for RVA while in the unvaccinated herd, 3/271 samples (1.11%) taken from 3 different calves tested positive. The genotyping of the VP7 genes showed 91.2% nucleotide sequence identity to G6 genotype (NCDV strain), and for the VP4 gene, strains from the vaccinated herd were 96.6% related to B223 strain, while strains from the unvaccinated herd were 88% related to P[5] genotype (UK strain). Genotypes found in this study were G6P[11] in the vaccinated herd and G6P[5] in the unvaccinated herd. All calves infected with rotavirus presented an episode of diarrhea in the first month of life, and the discrepancy between the genotypes found in the commercial vaccine (G6P[1] and G10P[11]) and the rotavirus strains circulating in both vaccinated and unvaccinated herds show the importance of keeping constant surveillance in order to avoid potential causes of vaccination failure.

28322352|t|Gene -based genome-wide association study identified 19p13.3 for lean body mass
28322352|a|Lean body mass (LBM) is a complex trait for human health. To identify genomic loci underlying LBM, we performed a gene -based genome-wide association study of lean mass index (LMI) in 1000 unrelated Caucasian subjects, and replicated in 2283 unrelated Caucasians subjects. Gene -based association analyses highlighted the significant associations of three genes UQCR, TCF3 and MBD3 in one single locus 19p13.3 (discovery p = 6.10 × 10(-5), 1.65 × 10(-4) and 1.10 × 10(-4); replication p = 2.21 × 10(-3), 1.84 × 10(-3) and 6.95 × 10(-3); combined p = 2.26 × 10(-6), 4.86 × 10(-6) and 1.15 × 10(-5), respectively). These results, together with the known functional relevance of the three genes to LMI, suggested that the 19p13.3 region containing UQCR, TCF3 and MBD3 genes was a novel locus underlying lean mass variation.

28322744|t|Basal ryanodine receptor activity suppresses autophagic flux
28322744|a|The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) and intracellular Ca(2+) signaling are critically involved in regulating different steps of autophagy, a lysosomal degradation pathway. The ryanodine receptors (RyR), intracellular Ca(2+)-release channels mainly expressed in excitable cell types including muscle and neurons, have however not yet been extensively studied in relation to autophagy. Yet, aberrant expression and excessive activity of RyRs in these tissues has been implicated in the onset of several diseases including Alzheimer's disease, where impaired autophagy regulation contributes to the pathology. In this study, we determined whether pharmacological RyR inhibition could modulate autophagic flux in ectopic RyR - expressing models, like HEK293 cells and in cell types that endogenously express RyR s, like C2C12 myoblasts and primary hippocampal neurons. Importantly, RyR3 overexpression in HEK293 cells impaired the autophagic flux. Conversely, in all cell models tested, pharmacological inhibition of endogenous or ectopically expressed RyRs, using dantrolene or ryanodine, augmented autophagic flux by increasing lysosomal turn-over (number of autophagosomes and autolysosomes measured as mCherry - LC3 punctae / cell increased from 70.37±7.81 in control HEK RyR3 cells to 111.18±7.72 and 98.14±7.31 after dantrolene and ryanodine treatments, respectively). Moreover, in differentiated C2C12 cells, transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that dantrolene treatment decreased the number of early autophagic vacuoles from 5.9±2.97 to 1.8±1.03 per cellular cross section. The modulation of the autophagic flux could be linked to the functional inhibition of RyR channels as both RyR inhibitors efficiently diminished the number of cells showing spontaneous RyR3 activity in the HEK293 cell model (from 41.14%±2.12 in control cells to 18.70%±2.25 and 9.74%±2.67 after dantrolene and ryanodine treatments, respectively). In conclusion, basal RyR -mediated Ca(2+)-release events suppress autophagic flux at the level of the lysosomes.

28322885|t|Fluoride concentration in saliva and biofilm fluid following the application of three fluoride varnishes
28322885|a|Most of the commercially available fluoride varnishes (FV) have not been evaluated for their cariostatic properties. Consequently, the aim of this in vivo study was to investigate intra - oral fluoride retention and clearance patterns from three different FV. Eighteen subjects (7-11 years) participated in a laboratory analyst - blinded, randomized, crossover study comparing the ability of 5% sodium fluoride varnishes (CavityShield-CS, Enamel Pro-EP, Vanish-V) to enhance fluoride concentrations in biofilm fluid, centrifuged and whole saliva over a period of 48h after a single FV application. Similar fluoride concentration × time patterns were noted for all investigated FV and studied variables, with the highest fluoride concentrations observed for the first biological sample collected after FV application (30min). Mean±SE (area under fluoride clearance curve) values were (μg F/g or ml×min): biofilm fluid - CS (472±191), EP (423±75), V (1264±279); centrifuged saliva - CS (42±7), EP (19±3), V (41±8); whole saliva - CS (68±11), EP (64±10), V (60±7). V delivered more fluoride to biofilm fluid than CS (p=0.0116) and EP (p=0.0065), which did not differ (p=0.27). For centrifuged saliva, CS and V were not significantly different (p=0.86), but resulted in higher fluoride retention than EP (p<0.0008). No significant differences among FV were observed for whole saliva (p=0.79). The present study has shown that FV vary in their ability to deliver fluoride intra - orally potentially related to formulation differences. To what extent the present findings relate to clinical efficacy remains, however, to be determined. Clinical research that investigates fluoride release patterns into saliva and biofilm fluid from different FV products is insufficient. More research is needed to investigate different FV formulations for their efficacy in order to help clinicians make better evidence based treatment choices.

28323338|t|The prognostic value of extranodal extension in human papillomavirus -associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma
28323338|a|Extranodal (or extracapsular) extension (ENE) is an adverse prognostic factor in patients with head and neck cancers who undergo primary surgery. However, the significance of ENE in human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is not well established, and single-institution studies have not established that ENE predicts inferior outcome. The authors investigated the prognostic value of ENE in HPV - positive patients who underwent primary surgery and whether adjuvant chemoradiation improved overall survival (OS) compared with radiation alone in ENE - positive patients. Patients who underwent primary surgery for pathologic T1 (pT1) through pT4 tumors, pathologic N1 (pN1) through pN3 lymph node status, HPV-positive OPSCC were identified in the National Cancer Data Base from 2010 through 2012. Features associated with ENE were analyzed. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses identified predictors of OS. The effect of adjuvant treatment on OS in ENE - positive cohort was also evaluated. In total, 1043 patients met inclusion criteria, among whom 43.5% were ENE - positive. Of the ENE - positive patients who had treatment details available, 72% received concurrent chemoradiotherapy, 16% received radiotherapy, and 12% received no adjuvant treatment. After a median follow-up of 28.4 months, ENE was associated with worse 3- year OS (89.3% vs 93.6%; P = .01). On multivariable analysis that included involved lymph nodes, only ENE, lymphovascular invasion, pT3/pT4 tumors, and Charlson-Deyo score were associated with worse OS. Among ENE - positive patients, there was no difference in 3- year OS between those who received adjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone (89.6% vs 89.3%, respectively; P = .55). Propensity score - matched comparison revealed similar results. ENE is associated with inferior OS in patients with HPV-positive OPSCC. However, OS was not better with adjuvant chemoradiotherapy compared with radiotherapy alone in ENE - positive patients. The current findings support the need for prospective studies of adjuvant chemoradiation in HPV - positive patients with ENE. Cancer 2017. © 2017 American Cancer Society.

28323926|t|Psychological Distress Is More Prevalent in Fertile Age and Premenopausal Women with PCOS Symptoms -15-yr Follow-up
28323926|a|Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with increased psychological distress; obesity and hyperandrogenism being suggested as key promoters. To investigate the prevalence of anxiety / depression and their coexistence in women with PCOS / PCOS symptoms at age s 31 and 46. The roles of obesity, hyperandrogenism and awareness of PCOS on psychological distress were also assessed. Population based follow-up. Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 with 15- year follow-up. At age 31 a questionnaire-based screening for oligoamenorrhea (OA) and hirsutism (H): 2188 asymptomatic (controls), 331 OA, 323 H, 125 OA + H (PCOS). 46 year old follow-up: 1576 controls, 239 OA, 231 H and 85 PCOS. Questionnaire-based screening for anxiety and depression symptoms (Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25) and previously diagnosed / treated depression at age 31 and 46. BMI, serum testosterone / free androgen index (FAI) and awareness of polycystic ovaries / PCOS on psychological distress were also assessed. Population-based prevalence of anxiety and/or depression in women with PCOS / PCOS symptoms at age s 31 and 46. Anxiety and/or depression symptoms, their coexistence and rate of depression were increased at age 31 and 46 in women with PCOS or isolated H compared with controls. High BMI or hyperandrogenism did not associate with increased anxiety or depression symptoms. The awareness of PCOS was associated with increased anxiety. Women with PCOS or isolated H present more often with anxiety and/or depression symptoms and their coexistence compared with controls. High BMI or hyperandrogenism did not provoke psychological distress in PCOS. The awareness of PCOS increased anxiety but did not associate with severe anxiety or depression.

28327913|t|The use of Oxford Nanopore native barcoding for complete genome assembly
28327913|a|The Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION(TM) is a mobile DNA sequencer that can produce long read sequences with a short turn-around time. Here we report the first demonstration of single contig genome assembly using Oxford Nanopore native barcoding when applied to a multiplexed library of 12 samples and combined with existing Illumina short-read data. This paves the way for the closure of multiple bacterial genomes from a single MinION(TM) sequencing run, given the availability of existing short-read data. The strain we used, MHO_001, represents the important community-acquired methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus lineage USA300. Using a hybrid assembly of existing short read and barcoded long read sequences from multiplexed data, we completed a genome of the S. aureus USA300 strain MHO_001. The long-read data represented only ~5-10% of an average MinION(TM) run (~7x genomic coverage), but, using standard tools, this was sufficient to complete the circular chromosome of S. aureus strain MHO_001 (2.86 Mb) and two complete plasmids (27 Kb and 3 Kb). Minor differences were noted when compared to USA300 reference genome, USA300_FPR3757, including the translocation, loss and gain of mobile genetic elements. Here we demonstrate that MinION(TM) reads, multiplexed using native barcoding, can be used in combination with short-read data, to fully complete a bacterial genome. The ability to complete multiple genomes, for which short-read data is already available, from a single MinION(TM) run is set to impact on our understanding of accessory genome content, plasmid diversity and genome rearrangements.

28329872|t|Doxorubicin Has Dose-Dependent Toxicity on Mouse Ovarian Follicle Development, Hormone Secretion, and Oocyte Maturation
28329872|a|Doxorubicin (DOX), one of the most commonly used anticancer medications, has been reported to affect fertility by damaging ovarian follicles; however, the dose-dependent toxicity of DOX on the dynamic follicle development and oocyte maturation has not been well-defined. Our objective is to determine the effects of human - relevant exposure levels of DOX on follicular functions across developmental time. In vitro cultured multilayered secondary mouse follicles were treated with DOX at 0, 2, 20, 100, and 200 nM for 24 h, and follicle development, hormone secretion, and oocyte maturation were analyzed. DOX caused dose-dependent toxicity on follicle growth, survival, and secretion of 17β-estradiol (E2). At 200 nM, DOX induced DNA damage and apoptosis in follicle somatic cells first and then in oocytes, which was correlated with the uptake of DOX first to the somatic cells followed by germ cells. Follicles treated with DOX at 0, 2, and 20 nM showed similar oocyte metaphase II (MII) percentages after in vitro oocyte maturation; however, 20 nM DOX significantly increased the number of MII oocytes with abnormal spindle morphology and chromosome misalignment. In an effort to harmonize the in vitro study to in vivo treatment, dose-dependent toxicity on oocyte meiotic maturation was found in 16-day-old CD-1 mice treated with DOX at 0, 0.4, 2, and 10 mg/kg, consistent with the in vitro oocyte maturation outcomes. Our study demonstrates that DOX has dose-dependent toxicity on ovarian follicle development, hormone secretion, and oocyte maturation, which are three key factors to support the female reproductive and endocrine functions.

28330470|t|Involvement of apoptotic pathways in docosahexaenoic acid -induced benefit in prostate cancer: Pathway-focused gene expression analysis using RT(2) Profile PCR Array System
28330470|a|Present study aimed to better understand the potential apoptotic pathways that involved in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-induced apoptosis of prostate cancer cells. Human prostate cancer DU145 cells were treated with different concentrations of fish oil, omega-3 PUFA (DHA, and Eicosapentaenoic acid, EPA), or omega-6 PUFA (Arachidonic acid, AA). Cell viability and apoptosis were evaluated by MTT assay and Hoechst staining. Pathway-focused gene expression profiling of DU145 cells was analyzed with the RT(2) Profile PCR Array System. The results were verified by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). AA exposure showed no obvious effect on viability of DU145 cells. However, exposure with fish oil, EPA, or DHA for 24 h significantly affected cell viability. The growth inhibition of DHA was more pronounced than that of EPA and showed a time-dependent increase. DHA exposure caused typical apoptotic characteristics. Ten genes were more expressed, while 5 genes were less expressed following DHA exposure. RT-qPCR confirmed the time dependent effect of DHA on the expression of these differentially expressed genes. KEGG pathway analysis showed that DHA may induce the apoptosis of cancer cells preferentially through mediating P53, MAPK, TNF, PI3K/AKT, and NF-κB signaling pathways. Our study demonstrated the beneficial action of DHA on human prostate carcinoma cell line DU145. The pro-apoptotic effect of DHA on DU145 cells may involve mediation various pathways, especially P53, MAPK, TNF, PI3K/AKT, and NF-κB signaling pathways. Molecular mechanisms of DHA on apoptosis of cancer cells still need to be further clarified.

28333697|t|Medication Reconciliation During Hospitalization and in Hospital-Home Interface: An Observational Retrospective Study
28333697|a|Medication errors are one of the leading causes of patient harms. Medication reconciliation is a fundamental process that to be effective, it should be embraced during each single care transition. Our objectives were to investigate current medication reconciliation practices in the 2 Fondazione Toscana Gabriele Monasterio hospitals and comprehensively assess the quality of medication reconciliation practices between inpatient and outpatient care by analyzing the medication patterns 6 months before admission, during hospitalization, and 9 months after discharge for a selected group of patients with cardiovascular diseases. A retrospective observational study was conducted in the Cardiothoracic Department of the Fondazione Toscana Gabriele Monasterio hospitals. Medication history was reviewed for all the patients admitted from and discharged to the community, from January to March 2013. Patients were excluded if they had less than 4 drugs or less than 2 drugs for cardiovascular system in their prescription list at admission or if they died during follow-up. We selected 714 patients, and we obtained the clinical charts and all drug prescriptions collected during patients ' hospitalization by the electronic clinical recording system. We also analyzed the list of prescriptions of this sample of patients, from 6 months before admission to 9 months after discharge, extracted from the regional prescription registry. In the resulting sample, prescriptions were analyzed to assess unintentional discrepancies. The study included 298 patients (mean age, 71.2 years), according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Among 14,573 prescriptions analyzed, we found 4363 discrepancies (14.6 discrepancies per patient). Among these discrepancies, 1310 were classified as unintentional (4.4 discrepancies per patient). Among unintentional discrepancies, only 63 (4.8%) took place during hospitalization. Although at the hospital-home interface, 33.1% of unintentional discrepancies were detected through the comparison between the patients ' declared therapy and the previous medication consumption and 62.1% were identified in the comparison between the prescription at the discharge and the following medication pattern at home. Medication errors have important implications for patient safety, and their identification is a main target for improving clinical practice. The comparison between the medication patterns acquired through the regional prescription registry before and after hospitalization outlined critical touchpoint in the current medication reconciliation process, calling for the definition of shared medication reconciliation standards between hospitals and primary care services to minimize medication discrepancies and enhance patient safety.

28334327|t|Autologous vs Irradiated Homologous Costal Cartilage as Graft Material in Rhinoplasty
28334327|a|Studies comparing surgical results of rhinoplasty using autologous costal cartilage (ACC) and irradiated homologous costal cartilage (IHCC) are rare. To compare the clinical results of major augmentation rhinoplasty using ACC vs IHCC and analyze the histologic properties of both types of cartilage. A retrospective clinical study was conducted among patients who had undergone rhinoseptoplasty using ACC or IHCC from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2014. Patients were followed up for more than 1 year after surgery and the histologic characteristics of ACC and IHCC were compared. The details of the surgical procedures and complications, including warping, infection, resorption, and/or donor-site morbidity, were evaluated by reviewing medical records and facial photographs. Patients ' subjective satisfaction with aesthetic and functional results was evaluated using a questionnaire. The details of the surgical procedures and complications, including warping, infection, resorption, and/or donor-site morbidity; patients ' subjective satisfaction with aesthetic and functional results ' objective evaluation of surgical outcomes, including symmetry, dorsal height, dorsal length, dorsal width, tip projection, tip rotation, tip width, and overall result; and histologic structures. Objective evaluation of surgical outcomes was graded using the Objective Rhinoplasty Outcome Score, which assessed symmetry, dorsal height, dorsal length, dorsal width, tip projection, tip rotation, tip width, and overall result. Histologic structures were evaluated using hematoxylin and eosin, Masson trichrome, Alcian blue, and Verhoeff elastic stains. A total of 63 patients (27 males and 36 females; mean [SD] age, 30.6 [9.5] years) had rhinoseptoplasty using ACC and 20 (9 males and 11 females; mean [SD] age, 35.4 [15.4] years) had rhinoseptoplasty using IHCC. Among observed complications, only notable resorption occurred more frequently in patients using IHCC (6 [30%]) than with ACC (2 [3%]) (P = .002). In subjective evaluations of aesthetic satisfaction, patients who received ACC showed significantly greater satisfaction (37 of 51 patients [73%] were very satisfied) than did those who received IHCC (6 of 20 [30%]) (P = .001). However, there was no between-group difference in subjective functional outcomes: 4 of 51 patients receiving ACC (8%) and 5 of 20 receiving IHCC (25%) were satisfied (P = .50) and 45 of 51 receiving ACC (88%) and 15 of 20 receiving IHCC (75%) were very satisfied (P = .15). Regarding objective aesthetic outcomes, all scores for both ACC and IHCC were more than 3.1 (between good and excellent). Histologic analyses showed larger, more evenly distributed, uniform chondrocytes and more collagens and proteoglycan contents in ACC than in IHCC. Compared with patients receiving IHCC, those receiving ACC for rhinoseptoplasty showed superior aesthetic satisfaction; ACC also had less frequent notable resorption. Autologous costal cartilage also had better histologic properties than IHCC did, suggesting it as an ideal graft material with less chance of long-term resorption. 3.

28334784|t|Testing the Ret and Sema3d genetic interaction in mouse enteric nervous system development
28334784|a|For most multigenic disorders, clinical manifestation (penetrance) and presentation (expressivity) are likely to be an outcome of genetic interaction between multiple susceptibility genes. Here, using gene knockouts in mice we evaluated genetic interaction between loss of Ret and loss of Sema3d, two Hirschsprung disease susceptibility genes. We intercrossed Ret and Sema3d double null heterozygotes to generate mice with the nine possible genotypes and assessed survival by counting various genotypes, myenteric plexus presence by acetylcholinesterase staining and embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) intestine transcriptome by RNA-sequencing. Survival rates of Ret wildtype, null heterozygote and null homozygote mice at E12.5, birth and weaning were not influenced by the genotypes at Sema3d locus and vice-versa. Loss of myenteric plexus was observed only in all Ret null homozygotes, irrespective of the genotypes at Sema3d locus, and Sema3d null heterozygote and homozygote mice had normal intestinal innervation. As compared to wildtype mice intestinal gene expression, loss of Ret in null homozygotes led to differential expression of ∼300 genes, whereas loss of Sema3d in null homozygotes had no major consequence and there was no evidence supporting major interaction between the two genes influencing intestine transcriptome. Overall, given the null alleles and phenotypic assays used, we did not find evidence for genetic interaction between Ret and Sema3d affecting survival, presence of myenteric plexus or intestine transcriptome.

28338376|t|Pembrolizumab for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer
28338376|a|In the last years, a spectacular development of immunotherapeutic agents aimed at the PD-1 / PD-L1 axis has taken place. This development of these checkpoint inhibitors has greatly influenced our approach to the treatment of lung cancer in first and second line. The limited toxicity profile and the ability to treat for prolonged periods, even in smokers, is a welcome expansion of the therapeutic arsenal of the oncologist. Areas covered: This review highlights the results of recent clinical trials on pembrolizumab for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. The authors discuss both first and second line treatment with pembrolizumab as monotherapy and in combination therapies. Additionally, implications of the PD-L1 immunohistochemistry assay with the 22C3 antibody and its use in clinical practice and trials is discussed. Expert commentary: A higher overall response, overall survival and a moderate toxicity profile is observed with the use of pembrolizumab, compared to chemotherapy, in both first and second line. These promising results have already translated into the registration of pembrolizumab in first and second line in patients with a high expression of PD-L1. However, as PD-L1 staining does not sufficiently discriminate responders from non-responders for all checkpoint inhibitors, there still is a need for a better predictive biomarker.

28338976|t|Synchronisms between bud and cambium phenology in black spruce: early - flushing provenances exhibit early xylem formation
28338976|a|Bud and cambial phenology represent the adaptation of species to the local environment that allows the growing season to be maximized while minimizing the risk of frost for the developing tissues. The temporal relationship between the apical and radial meristems can help in the understanding of tree growth as a whole process. The aim of this study was to compare cambial phenology in black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) provenances classified as early and late bud flushing. The different phases of cambial phenology were assessed on wood microcores sampled weekly from April to October in 2014 and 2015 from 61 trees growing in a provenance trial in Quebec, Canada. Trees showing an early bud flush also exhibited early reactivation of xylem differentiation, although an average difference of 12 days for buds corresponded to small although significant differences of 4 days for xylem. Provenances with early bud flush had an early bud set and completed xylem formation earlier than late bud flush provenances. No significant difference in the period of xylem formation and total growth was observed between the flushing classes. Our results demonstrate that the ecotype differentiation of black spruce provenances represented by the phenological adaptation of buds to the local climate corresponds to specific growth dynamics of the xylem.

28340485|t|An approach for liposome immobilization using sterically stabilized micelles (SSMs) as a precursor for bio-layer interferometry - based interaction studies
28340485|a|Non-fluidic bio-layer interferometry (BLI) has rapidly become a standard tool for monitoring almost all biomolecular interactions in a label-free, real-time and high-throughput manner. High - efficiency screening methods which measure the kinetics of liposomes with a variety of compounds require the immobilization of liposomes. In this work, a method is described for immobilizing liposomes for interaction studies, based on the biophysical principles of this biosensor platform. The immobilization approach includes the loading of DSPE-PEG(2000) - biotin containing sterically stabilized micelles (SSMs) which are restructured in a buffer change step, resulting in an accessible substrate for liposome immobilization. Liposomes in a concentration of 5mM of varying composition and fluidity were immobilized on the sensor surface by inserting the hydrophobic residues of the former loaded SSMs. This proof of principle was carried out using Cytochrome C as a membrane-interacting model protein. The binding of Cytochrome C to the immobilized liposomes was demonstrated, and the derived kinetic and affinity constants were similar to values given in the literature. In order to obtain a detailed understanding of this surface, and to show the integrity of the liposomes, confocal fluorescence microscopy was used. Images of immobilized liposomes containing calcein in the aqueous core indicated intact vesicles. A combination of this simple liposome immobilization approach, the possibility of automation on BLI systems with high throughput within an acceptable timescale and excellent reproducibility makes this assay suitable for basic research as well as for industrial and regulatory applications.

28341903|t|Exercise increases lactoferrin, but decreases lysozyme in salivary granulocytes
28341903|a|Intracellular lactoferrin (Lac) and lysozyme (Lys) content play an important role in regulating inflammation and promoting host protection. While exercise has demonstrated an increase in Lac and Lys concentration in exocrine solutions, little is known regarding intracellular concentration changes in response to exercise. To quantify intracellular Lac and Lys concentration before and after exercise in salivary CD45(+)CD15(+) cells. 11 males (20.3 ± 0.8 years, 57.2 ± 7.6 mL/kg/min V̇O2pk, 11.1 ± 3.9% body fat) ran for 45 min at 75% of VO2pk. 12 mL of stimulated saliva were collected pre and immediately post exercise. Saliva was filtered through a 30-µm filter before analysis of leukocytes (CD45(+)) and granulocytes (CD45(+)CD15(+)) using flow cytometry. Median fluorescent intensity (MFI) of Lac increased from pre (64,268 ± 46,036 MFI) to post (117,134 ± 88,115 MFI) exercise (p <0.05). Lys MFI decreased with exercise (pre: 16,933 ± 8249; post: 11,616 ± 6875) (p <0.05). Acute running resulted in an increased Lac concentration which could lead to a decrease in inflammation, adding further evidence of the anti-inflammatory effects of exercise. Conversely, the exercise -associated decrease of intracellular Lys content could be the cause of increased Lys in exocrine solutions.

28345005|t|Chronic Enzyme Replacement to the Brain of a Late Infantile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Mouse Has Differential Effects on Phenotypes of Disease
28345005|a|Late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (LINCL) is a fatal inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by loss of lysosomal protease tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1). We have investigated the effects of chronic intrathecal (IT) administration using enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) to the brain of an LINCL mouse model, in which locomotor function declines dramatically prior to early death. Median lifespan was significantly extended from 126 days to >259 days when chronic IT treatment was initiated before the onset of disease. While treated animals lived longer and showed little sign of locomotor dysfunction as measured by stride length, some or all (depending on regimen) still died prematurely. One explanation is that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-mediated delivery may not deliver TPP1 to all brain regions. Morphological studies support this, showing delivery of TPP1 to ventral, but not deeper and dorsal regions. When IT treatment is initiated in severely affected LINCL mice, lifespan was extended modestly in most but dramatically extended in approximately one-third of the cohort. Treatment improved locomotor function in these severely compromised animals after it had declined to the point at which animals normally die. This indicates that some pathology in LINCL is reversible and does not simply reflect neuronal death.

28346872|t|5-Bromo-2-aryl benzimidazole derivatives as non-cytotoxic potential dual inhibitors of α-glucosidase and urease enzymes
28346872|a|On the basis of previous report on promising α-glucosidase inhibitory activity of 5-bromo-2-aryl benzimidazole derivatives, these derivatives were further screened for urease inhibitory and cytotoxicity activity in order to get more potent and non-cytotoxic potential dual inhibitor for the patients suffering from diabetes as well as peptic ulcer. In this study, all compounds showed varying degree of potency in the range of (IC50 =8.15±0.03-354.67±0.19μM) as compared to standard thiourea (IC50 =21.25±0.15μM). It is worth mentioning that derivatives 7 (IC50 =12.07±0.05μM), 8 (IC50 =10.57±0.12μM), 11 (IC50 =13.76±0.02μM), 14 (IC50 =15.70±0.12μM) and 22 (IC50 =8.15±0.03μM) were found to be more potent inhibitors than standard. All compounds were also evaluated for cytotoxicity towards 3T3 mouse fibroblast cell line and found to be completely non-toxic. Previously benzimidazole 1-25 were also showed α-glucosidase inhibitory potential. In silico studies were performed on the lead molecules i.e. 2, 7, 8, 11, 14, and 22, in order to rationalize the binding interaction of compounds with the active site of urease enzyme.

28347978|t|Intra-articular implantation of collagen scaffold carriers is safe in both native and arthrofibrotic rabbit knee joints
28347978|a|Sustained intra-articular delivery of pharmacological agents is an attractive modality but requires use of a safe carrier that would not induce cartilage damage or fibrosis. Collagen scaffolds are widely available and could be used intra-articularly, but no investigation has looked at the safety of collagen scaffolds within synovial joints. The aim of this study was to determine the safety of collagen scaffold implantation in a validated in vivo animal model of knee arthrofibrosis. A total of 96 rabbits were randomly and equally assigned to four different groups: arthrotomy alone; arthrotomy and collagen scaffold placement; contracture surgery; and contracture surgery and collagen scaffold placement. Animals were killed in equal numbers at 72 hours, two weeks, eight weeks, and 24 weeks. Joint contracture was measured, and cartilage and synovial samples underwent histological analysis. Animals that underwent arthrotomy had equivalent joint contractures regardless of scaffold implantation (-13.9° versus -10.9°, equivalence limit 15°). Animals that underwent surgery to induce contracture did not demonstrate equivalent joint contracture s with (41.8°) or without (53.9°) collagen scaffold implantation. Chondral damage occurred in similar rates with (11 of 48) and without (nine of 48) scaffold implantation. No significant difference in synovitis was noted between groups. Absorption of the collagen scaffold occurred within eight weeks in all animals CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that intra-articular implantation of a collagen sponge does not induce synovitis or cartilage damage. Implantation in a native joint does not seem to induce contracture. Implantation of the collagen sponge in a rabbit knee model of contracture may decrease the severity of the contracture .Cite this article: J. A. Walker, T. J. Ewald, E. Lewallen, A. Van Wijnen, A. D.

28348057|t|HOST IMMUNE RECOGNITION OF THE EPIDEMIC CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATHOGEN BURKHOLDERIA DOLOSA
28348057|a|Burkholderia dolosa caused an outbreak in the cystic fibrosis (CF) clinic at Boston Children's Hospital from 1998 to 2005 and led to the infection of over 40 patients, many of whom died due to complications from infection by this organism. To assess whether B. dolosa significantly contributes to disease or is recognized by the host immune response, mice were infected with a sequenced outbreak B. dolosa strain, AU0158, and responses compared to the well-studied CF pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa In parallel, mice were also infected with a polar flagellin mutant of B. dolosa to examine the role of flagella in B. dolosa lung colonization. The results showed a higher persistence in the host by B. dolosa strains and yet neutrophil recruitment and cytokine production were lower compared to P. aeruginosa The ability of host immune cells to recognize B. dolosa was then assessed and B. dolosa induced a robust cytokine response in cultured cells and this effect was dependent on the flagella only when bacteria were dead. Together, these results suggest that B. dolosa can be recognized by host cells in vitro but may avoid or suppress the host immune response in vivo through unknown mechanisms. B. dolosa was then compared to other Burkholderia species and found to induce similar levels of cytokine production despite being internalized by macrophages more than B. cenocepacia strains. These data suggest that B. dolosa AU0158 may act differently with host cells and is it recognized differently by immune systems compared other Burkholderia strains or species.

28355176|t|Visualization and targeting of LGR5(+) human colon cancer stem cells
28355176|a|The cancer stem cell (CSC) theory highlights a self-renewing subpopulation of cancer cells that fuels tumour growth. The existence of human CSCs is mainly supported by xenotransplantation of prospectively isolated cells, but their clonal dynamics and plasticity remain unclear. Here, we show that human LGR5(+) colorectal cancer cells serve as CSCs in growing cancer tissues. Lineage - tracing experiments with a tamoxifen -inducible Cre knock-in allele of LGR5 reveal the self-renewal and differentiation capacity of LGR5(+) tumour cells. Selective ablation of LGR5(+) CSCs in LGR5 -i Caspase9 knock-in organoids leads to tumour regression, followed by tumour regrowth driven by re-emerging LGR5(+) CSCs. KRT20 knock-in reporter marks differentiated cancer cells that constantly diminish in tumour tissues, while reverting to LGR5(+) CSCs and contributing to tumour regrowth after LGR5(+) CSC ablation. We also show that combined chemotherapy potentiates targeting of LGR5(+) CSCs. These data provide insights into the plasticity of CSCs and their potential as a therapeutic target in human colorectal cancer.

28355605|t|The Use of a Software - Assisted Method to Estimate Fetal Weight at and Near Term Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging
28355605|a|The aim of this study was to apply a semi-automated calculation method of fetal body volume and, thus, of magnetic resonance-estimated fetal weight (MR-EFW) prior to planned delivery and to evaluate whether the technique of measurement could be simplified while remaining accurate. MR-EFW was calculated using a semi-automated method at 38.6 weeks of gestation in 36 patients and compared to the picture archiving and communication system (PACS). Per patient, 8 sequences were acquired with a slice thickness of 4-8 mm and an intersection gap of 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, or 20 mm. The median absolute relative errors for MR-EFW and the time of planimetric measurements were calculated for all 8 sequences and for each method (assisted vs. PACS), and the difference between the methods was calculated. The median delivery weight was 3,280 g. The overall median relative error for all 288 MR-EFW calculations was 2.4% using the semi-automated method and 2.2% for the PACS method. Measurements did not differ between the 8 sequences using the assisted method (p = 0.313) or the PACS (p = 0.118), while the time of planimetric measurement decreased significantly with a larger gap (p < 0.001) and in the assisted method compared to the PACS method (p < 0.01). Our simplified MR-EFW measurement showed a dramatic decrease in time of planimetric measurement without a decrease in the accuracy of weight estimates.

28355968|t|Abiraterone - induced rhabdomyolysis resulting in acute kidney injury: A case report and review of the literature
28355968|a|Abiraterone, a CYP17 inhibitor, blocks androgen biosynthesis in multiple tissue types. In combination with prednisone, it is approved as a first-line treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. We present a case of rhabdomyolysis associated with abiraterone therapy resulting in acute on chronic kidney injury in a patient with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Strict monitoring should be employed in patients started on abiraterone who have additional risk factors for developing rhabdomyolysis.

28356949|t|Association between XRCC1 and ERCC1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and the efficacy of concurrent radiochemotherapy in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
28356949|a|The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in X-ray repair cross-complementing 1-399 (XRCC1-399) or excision repair cross-complementation group 1-118 (ERCC1-118) and the short-term efficacy of radiochemotherapy, tumor metastasis and relapse, as well as the survival time in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). TaqMan probe-based quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was conducted to examine the levels of XRCC1-399 and ERCC1-118 SNPs in the peripheral blood of 50 patients with pathologically confirmed ESCC. In addition, the associations between different genotypes and short-term therapeutic efficacy [the complete remission (CR) rate], tumor metastasis and relapse, as well as the survival time following concurrent radiochemotherapy, were determined. A total of 50 ESCC patients who received concurrent radiochemotherapy were enrolled. It was found that the short-term therapeutic efficacy (CR rate) was higher in the group of patients carrying the homozygous mutation of XRCC1-399 (A / A genotype) than in the group of patients without the XRCC1-399 mutation (G / G genotype). In addition, the CR rate was significantly increased in patients carrying one or two ERCC1-118 C alleles (C / C or C / T genotype) compared with patients lacking the C allele (T / T genotype). The differences were statistically significant (A / A vs. G / G, P=0.014; T T vs. C / T + C / C, P=0.040). During the follow-up period, the group of patients carrying the homozygous mutation of XRCC1-399 (A / A genotype) exhibited a markedly reduced risk of metastasis and relapse compared with the group of patients carrying non-mutated XRCC1-399 (G / G genotype; P=0.031). By contrast, ERCC1-118 SNP was not associated with the risk of metastasis and recurrence (P>0.05). The combined results of univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that the SNP in ERCC1-118 was closely associated with survival time. The mean survival time was significantly prolonged in patients carrying 1 or 2 C alleles (C / C or C / T genotype) compared with patients lacking the C allele (T / T genotype) [T / T vs. C / C, HR =12.96, 95% confidence interval (CI)=3.08-54.61, P<0.001; T T vs. C / T + C / C, HR =11.71, 95% CI =3.06-44.83, P<0.001]. However, XRCC1-399 SNP had no effect on survival time (P>0.05). XRCCl-399 SNP was associated with the short-term therapeutic efficacy (the CR rate) and tumor metastasis / relapse in ESCC patients who received the docetaxel plus cisplatin (TP) regimen -based concurrent radiochemotherapy. By contrast, ERCC1-118 SNP was significantly associated with the short-term therapeutic efficacy (the CR rate) and survival time in ESCC patients who received TP regimen -based concurrent radiochemotherapy.

28357725|t|Ventricular pacing site separation by cardiac computed tomography: validation for the prediction of clinical response to cardiac resynchronization therapy
28357725|a|Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) fails to provide benefit in up to one-third of patients. Maximizing the geographic separation of right and left ventricular pacing lead sites has been suggested as one way to improve response. Cardiac CT provides an opportunity to explore 3-dimensional inter-lead distance (ILD) measures for the prediction of CRT response. The objective of this study was to investigate associations between standardized measures of ILD by cardiac CT and echocardiographic response to CRT. Forty-two consecutive patients undergoing CRT had serial clinical and echocardiographic evaluations performed in addition to a post-procedural cardiac -gated CT with blinded measurement of direct and circumferential (via the myocardium) ILD measures. Clinical response to CRT, the primary clinical outcome, was defined as a ≥15% reduction in LVESV using echocardiography at 6-months. The mean age and ejection fraction was 63.6 ± 8.9 years and 25.2 ± 7.8%, respectively. The primary outcome occurred in 35 of 42 patients (83%). Both direct and circumferential CT -based ILD measures were associated with the primary outcome by univariate analysis. Receiver Operator Characteristic analysis identified Circumferential ILD to have the strongest predictive accuracy (AUC 0.78). Inter- and intra-observer reproducibility of CT -derived ILD measures was excellent. Circumferential ILD measures on cardiac CT are predictive of clinical response to CRT. Incorporation of these measures into the selection of optimal pacing targets, particularly from pre-procedural CT coronary vein imaging may be of therapeutic benefit and warrants further investigation.

28358234|t|Iodine Storage and Metabolism of Mild to Moderate Iodine-Deficient Pregnant Rats
28358234|a|Severe iodine deficiency during pregnancy results in neurodevelopmental disorders in children, while the consequences of mild to moderate iodine deficiency (MMID) are uncertain. The concentration of iodine in the thyroid is the most accurate indicator of iodine nutrition. This study aimed to evaluate whether the iodine stores in the thyroid cover the needs of the mother and the fetus in iodine - sufficient and MMID conditions by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. One hundred four-week-old female Wistar rats were randomly divided into MMID (low iodine intake [L]) and normal (normal iodine intake [N]) groups. The rats were fed for the next three months, and after pregnancy they were further divided into two subgroups, respectively: low iodine pregnancy (LP) and low iodine pregnancy with iodine supplement (LP+), and normal iodine intake pregnancy (NP) and normal iodine intake pregnancy with iodine supplement (NP+). The iodine intake of pregnant rats in the NP+ and LP+ groups was twice as much as in the NP and LP groups. The rats were sacrificed on gestational day 15 and postnatal day 7. The iodine concentration in the thyroid of the maternal and newborn rats, maternal serum, placenta, and amniotic fluid were determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. The concentration of iodine in the thyroid of the N group was significantly higher than that in the L group before pregnancy. The concentration of iodine in the maternal thyroids of the LP group decreased during pregnancy, whereas that of the NP group did not change significantly. There was no significant difference in the iodine concentration in the thyroid of mothers and offspring between the NP and NP+ groups, but it was significant between LP and LP+ groups. The concentration of iodine in amniotic fluid was significantly different between the four groups. There is sufficient iodine storage in the thyroid of maternal rats with normal iodine intake during pregnancy, and there is no need for iodine supplementation. However, iodine stores are insufficient in rats with MMID. Iodine supplementation can increase the iodine concentration in the thyroid of maternal rats with MMID and their offspring, as well as in the amniotic fluid during pregnancy.

28359664|t|Omega 3 Fatty Acids Reduce Bone Resorption While Promoting Bone Generation in Rat Apical Periodontitis
28359664|a|This study evaluated the effects of the dietary supplement omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 PUFAs) on pulp exposure -induced apical periodontitis (AP) in rats. Twenty-eight male rats were divided into groups: control untreated rats (C), control rats treated with ω-3 PUFAs alone (C-O), rats with pulp exposure -induced AP, and rats with pulp exposure -induced AP treated with ω-3 PUFAs (AP -O). The ω-3 PUFAs were administered orally, once a day, for 15 days before pulp exposure and, subsequently, 30 days after pulp exposure. Rats were killed 30 days after pulp exposure, and jaws were subjected to histologic and immunohistochemical analyses. Immunohistochemical analyses were performed to detect tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase - positive osteoclasts and osteocalcin - positive osteoblasts on the bone surface of periapical area. Results were statistically evaluated by using analysis of variance and Tukey honestly significant difference, and P < .05 was considered statistically significant. The bone resorption lesion was significantly larger in the AP group compared with AP -O, C, and C-O groups (P < .05). The level of inflammatory cell infiltration was significantly elevated, and the number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase - positive osteoclasts was significantly higher in the periapical lesions of the AP group compared with AP -O, C, and C-O groups (P < .05). The number of osteocalcin - positive osteoblasts was significantly increased in the AP -O group compared with the AP group (P > .05). Supplementation with ω-3 PUFAs not only suppresses bone resorption but also promotes new bone formation in the periapical area of rats with AP in conjunction with downregulation of inflammatory cell infiltration into the lesion.

28360843|t|MagR Alone Is Insufficient to Confer Cellular Calcium Responses to Magnetic Stimulation
28360843|a|Magnetic manipulation of cell activity offers advantages over optical manipulation but an ideal tool remains elusive. The MagR protein was found through its interaction with cryptochrome (Cry) and the protein in solution appeared to respond to magnetic stimulation (MS). After we initiated an investigation on the specific role of MagR in cellular response to MS, a subsequent study claimed that MagR expression alone could achieve cellular activation by MS. Here we report that despite systematically testing different ways of measuring intracellular calcium and different MS protocols, it was not possible to detect any cellular or neuronal responses to MS in MagR - expressing HEK cells or primary neurons from the dorsal root ganglion and the hippocampus. By contrast, in neurons co-expressing MagR and channelrhodopin, optical but not MS increased calcium influx in hippocampal neurons. Our results indicate that MagR alone is not sufficient to confer cellular magnetic responses.

28361230|t|Acute kidney injury and fluid overload in infants and children after cardiac surgery
28361230|a|Acute kidney injury is a common and serious complication after congenital heart surgery, particularly among infants. This comorbidity has been independently associated with adverse outcomes including an increase in mortality. Postoperative acute kidney injury has a complex pathophysiology with many risk factors, and therefore no single medication or therapy has been demonstrated to be effective for treatment or prevention. However, it has been established that the associated fluid overload is one of the major determinants of morbidity, particularly in infants after cardiac surgery. Therefore, in the absence of an intervention to prevent acute kidney injury, much of the effort to improve outcomes has focused on treating and preventing fluid overload. Early renal replacement therapy, often in the form of peritoneal dialysis, has been shown to be safe and beneficial in infants with oliguria after heart surgery. As understanding of the pathophysiology of acute kidney injury and the ability to confidently diagnose it earlier continues to evolve, it is likely that novel preventative and therapeutic interventions will be available in the future.

28362102|t|Systems Toxicology: Real World Applications and Opportunities
28362102|a|Systems Toxicology aims to change the basis of how adverse biological effects of xenobiotics are characterized from empirical end points to describing modes of action as adverse outcome pathways and perturbed networks. Toward this aim, Systems Toxicology entails the integration of in vitro and in vivo toxicity data with computational modeling. This evolving approach depends critically on data reliability and relevance, which in turn depends on the quality of experimental models and bioanalysis techniques used to generate toxicological data. Systems Toxicology involves the use of large-scale data streams ("big data "), such as those derived from omics measurements that require computational means for obtaining informative results. Thus, integrative analysis of multiple molecular measurements, particularly acquired by omics strategies, is a key approach in Systems Toxicology. In recent years, there have been significant advances centered on in vitro test systems and bioanalytical strategies, yet a frontier challenge concerns linking observed network perturbations to phenotypes, which will require understanding pathways and networks that give rise to adverse responses. This summary perspective from a 2016 Systems Toxicology meeting, an international conference held in the Alps of Switzerland, describes the limitations and opportunities of selected emerging applications in this rapidly advancing field. Systems Toxicology aims to change the basis of how adverse biological effects of xenobiotics are characterized, from empirical end points to pathways of toxicity. This requires the integration of in vitro and in vivo data with computational modeling. Test systems and bioanalytical technologies have made significant advances, but ensuring data reliability and relevance is an ongoing concern. The major challenge facing the new pathway approach is determining how to link observed network perturbations to phenotypic toxicity.

28363626|t|Validating Signs and Symptoms From An Actual Mass Casualty Incident to Characterize An Irritant Gas Syndrome Agent (IGSA) Exposure: A First Step in The Development of a Novel IGSA Triage Algorithm
28363626|a|Chemical exposures can pose a significant threat to life. Rapid assessment by first responders / emergency nurses is required to reduce death and disability. Currently, no informatics tools for irritant gas syndrome agent s (IGSA) exposures exist to process victims efficiently, continuously monitor for latent signs/symptoms, or make triage recommendations. This study describes the first step in developing ED informatics tools for chemical incidents: validation of signs/symptoms that characterize an IGSA syndrome. Data abstracted from 146 patients treated for chlorine exposure in one emergency department during a 2005 train derailment and 152 patients not exposed to chlorine (a comparison group) were mapped to 93 possible signs/symptoms within 2 tools (WISER and CHEMM-IST) designed to assist emergency responders / emergency nurses with managing hazardous material exposures. Inferential statistics (χ(2)/ Fisher's exact test) and diagnostics tests were used to examine mapped signs/symptoms of persons who were and were not exposed to chlorine. Three clusters of signs/symptoms are statistically associated with an IGSA syndrome (P < .01): respiratory (shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing, and choking); chest discomfort (tightness, pain, and burning), and eye, nose and/or throat (pain, irritation, and burning). The syndrome requires the presence of signs/symptoms from at least 2 of these clusters. The latency period must also be considered for exposed / potentially exposed persons. This study uses actual patient data from a chemical incident to characterize and validate signs/symptoms of an IGSA syndrome. Validating signs/symptoms is the first step in developing new ED informatics tools with the potential to revolutionize the process by which emergency nurses manage triage victims of chemical incidents.

28363782|t|Fyn regulates multipolar - bipolar transition and neurite morphogenesis of migrating neurons in the developing neocortex
28363782|a|Fyn is a non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase that belongs to Src family kinases. Fyn plays a critical role in neuronal migration, but the mechanism remains unclear. Here, we reported that suppression of Fyn expression in mouse cerebral cortex led to migration defects of both early-born and late-born neurons. Morphological analysis showed that loss of Fyn function impaired multipolar - bipolar transition of newly generated neurons and neurite formation in the early phase of migration. Moreover, Fyn inhibition increased the length of leading process and decreased the branching number of the migrating cortical neurons. Together, these results indicate that Fyn controls neuronal migration by regulating the cytoskeletal dynamics and multipolar - bipolar transition of newly generated neurons during cortical development.

28367636|t|Closing the Loop in Adults, Children and Adolescents With Suboptimally Controlled Type 1 Diabetes Under Free Living Conditions: A Psychosocial Substudy
28367636|a|The objective was to explore psychosocial experiences of closed loop technology for adults, children, and adolescents with type 1 diabetes and their parents taking part in two multicenter, free - living, randomized crossover home studies. Participants using insulin pump therapy were randomized to either 12 weeks of automated closed-loop glucose control, then 12 weeks of sensor augmented insulin pump therapy (open loop), or vice versa. Closed loop was used for 24 hours by adults and overnight only by children and adolescents. Participants completed the Diabetes Technology Questionnaire (DTQ) periodically and shared their views in semistructured interviews. This analysis characterizes the impact of the technology, positive and negative aspects of living with the device, alongside participants ' expectations, hopes, and anxieties. Participants were 32 adults, age 38.6 ± 9.6 years, 55% male, and 26 children, mean age 12 years (range 6-18 years), 54% male. DTQ results indicated moderately favorable impact of, and satisfaction with, both open and closed loop interventions, but little evidence of a comparative advantage of either. Key positive themes included perceived improved blood glucose control, improved general well-being, particularly on waking, improved sleep, reduced burden of diabetes, and visibility of data. Key negative themes included having to carry around the equipment and dislike of the pump and second cannula (ie, sensor) inserted. Overall, participants reported a positive experience of the closed loop technology. Results are consistent with previous research with size of equipment continuing to be a problem. Progress is being made in the usability of the closed-loop system.

28370352|t|Serum levels of genomic DNA of α1(I) collagen are elevated in scleroderma patients
28370352|a|Recent studies have indicated that various nucleic acids are present in human sera, and attracted attention for their potential as novel disease markers in many human diseases. In this study, we tried to evaluate the possibility that DNA and RNA of collagens exist in human sera, and determined whether their serum levels can be useful biomarkers in scleroderma patients. The RNA or DNA of collagens were purified from sera, and detected by polymerase chain reaction or quantitated by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Among approximately 18 360 bases of full-length α1(I) collagen DNA, various regions were detected by polymerase chain reaction in human sera. However, α2(I) collagen DNA, α1(I) collagen RNA or α2(I) collagen RNA were not detectable. α1(I) Collagen DNA in sera was quantitative using our method. The levels of serum α1(I) collagen DNA were significantly increased in scleroderma patients compared with healthy control subjects or systemic lupus erythematosus patients. According to the receiver-operator curve analysis, serum α1(I) collagen DNA levels were shown to be effective as a diagnostic marker of scleroderma. Furthermore, when we determined the association of serum α1(I) collagen DNA levels with clinical / laboratory features in scleroderma patients, those with elevated α1(I) collagen DNA levels showed significantly higher prevalence of pitting scars / ulcers. In summary, elevation of serum α1(I) collagen DNA levels in scleroderma patients may be useful as the diagnostic marker, reflecting the presence of vasculopathy. Jou rna

28370605|t|Metabolite mapping by consecutive nanostructure and silver-assisted mass spectrometry imaging on tissue sections
28370605|a|Nanostructure-based mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a promising technology for molecular imaging of small molecules, without the complex chemical background typically encountered in matrix-assisted molecular imaging approaches. Here, we have enhanced these surfaces with silver (Ag) to provide a second tier of MSI data from a single sample. MSI data was acquired through the application of laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry to biological samples imprinted onto desorption/ionization on silicon (DIOS) substrates. Following initial analysis, ultra-thin Ag layers were overlaid onto the followed by MSI analysis (Ag-DIOS MSI). This approach was first demonstrated for fingermark small molecules including environmental contaminants and sebum components. Subsequently, this bimodal method was translated to lipids and metabolites in fore-stomach sections from a 6-bromoisatin chemopreventative murine mouse model. DIOS MSI allowed mapping of common ions in fingermarks as well as 6-bromoisatin metabolites and lipids in murine fore-stomach. Furthermore, DIOS MSI was complemented by the Ag-DIOS MSI of Ag-adductable lipids such as wax esters in fingermarks and cholesterol in murine fore-stomach. Gastrointestinal acid condensation products of 6-bromoisatin, such as the 6,6'-dibromoindirubin mapped herein, are very challenging to isolate and characterize. By re-analyzing the same tissue imprints, this metabolite was readily detected by DIOS, placed in a tissue-specific spatial context, and subsequently overlaid with additional lipid distributions acquired using Ag-DIOS MSI. The ability to place metabolite and lipid classes in a tissue-specific context makes this novel method suited to MSI analyses where the collection of additional information from the same sample maximises resource use, and also maximises the number of annotated small molecules, in particular for metabolites that are typically undetectable with traditional platforms.

28370728|t|Towards culturally competent paediatric oncology care. A qualitative study from the perspective of care providers
28370728|a|In order to gain more insight on the influence of ethnic diversity in paediatric cancer care, the perspectives of care providers were explored. Semi-structured interviews were conducted among 12 paediatric oncologists and 13 nurses of two different paediatric oncology wards and were analysed using a framework method. We found that care providers described the contact with Turkish and Moroccan parents as more difficult. They offered two reasons for this: (1) language barriers between care provider and parents hindered the exchange of information; (2) cultural barriers between care provider and parents about sharing the diagnosis and palliative perspective hindered communication. Care providers reported different solutions to deal with these barriers, such as using an interpreter and improving their cultural knowledge about their patients. They, however, were not using interpreters sufficiently and were unaware of the importance of eliciting parents ' perspectives. Communication techniques to overcome dilemmas between parents and care providers were not used and care providers were unaware of stereotypes and prejudice. Care providers should be offered insight in cultural barriers they are unaware of. Training in cultural competence might be a possibility to overcome manifest barriers.

28371313|t|Obesogenic eating behaviors mediate the relationships between psychological problems and BMI in children
28371313|a|To examine the association between psychological problems and weight status in children aged 3.5 to 4 years and test whether obesogenic eating behaviors mediate this relationship. This study is a cross-sectional secondary analysis of data from first-time mothers (N = 194) in the control arm of the NOURISH randomized controlled trial. At child age 3.5 to 4 years, maternal -reported child eating behaviors and psychological problems were collected via valid tools, and child weight and height data were collected by trained study staff. Pearson's correlations and linear regressions examined associations between eating behaviors, psychological problems, and BMI z score. Multiple mediation models were tested by assessing indirect effects of psychological problems on BMI z score via obesogenic eating behaviors. Peer problems were associated with both higher food responsiveness and emotional overeating and directly with higher BMI z score. This relationship was partially mediated by emotional overeating. Both emotional overeating and food responsiveness fully mediated the association between emotional problems and BMI z score, and food responsiveness fully mediated the association between conduct problems and BMI z score. The findings suggest that children with psychological problems may also display obesogenic eating behaviors, which may result in higher BMI. This needs to be considered in the clinical management of both pediatric overweight / obesity and psychological problems.

28371745|t|Homocysteine as a peripheral biomarker in bipolar disorder: A meta-analysis
28371745|a|Bipolar disorder (BD) is a psychiatric disorder with an uncertain aetiology. Recently, special attention has been given to homocysteine (Hcy), as it has been suggested that alterations in 1-carbon metabolism might be implicated in diverse psychiatric disorders. However, there is uncertainty regarding possible alterations in peripheral Hcy levels in BD. This study comprises a meta-analysis comparing serum and plasma Hcy levels in persons with BD and healthy controls. We conducted a systematic search for all eligible English and non-English peer-reviewed articles. Nine cross-sectional studies were included in the meta-analyses, providing data on 1547 participants. Random-effects meta-analysis showed that serum and plasma levels of Hcy were increased in subjects with BD in either mania or euthymia when compared to healthy controls, with a large effect size in the mania group (g=0.98, 95% CI: 0.8-1.17, P<0.001, n=495) and a small effect in the euthymia group (g=0.3, 95% CI: 0.11-0.48, P=0.002, n=1052). Our meta-analysis provides evidence that Hcy levels are elevated in persons with BD during mania and euthymia. Peripheral Hcy could be considered as a potential biomarker in BD, both of trait (since it is increased in euthymia), and also of state (since its increase is more accentuated in mania). Longitudinal studies are needed to clarify the relationship between bipolar disorder and Hcy, as well as the usefulness of peripheral Hcy as both a trait and state biomarker in BD.

28373195|t|Structural Modification of Lipopolysaccharide Conferred by mcr-1 in Gram-Negative ESKAPE Pathogens
28373195|a|mcr-1 was initially reported as the first plasmid -mediated colistin resistance gene in clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae in China and has subsequently been identified worldwide in various species of the family Enterobacteriaceae mcr-1 encodes a phosphoethanolamine transferase, and its expression has been shown to generate phosphoethanolamine -modified bis-phosphorylated hexa-acylated lipid A in E. coli Here, we investigated the effects of mcr-1 on colistin susceptibility and on lipopolysaccharide structures in laboratory and clinical strains of the Gram-negative ESKAPE (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, K. pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) pathogens, which are often treated clinically by colistin. The effects of mcr-1 on colistin resistance were determined using MIC assays of laboratory and clinical strains of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii, and P. aeruginosa Lipid A structural changes resulting from MCR-1 were analyzed by mass spectrometry. The introduction of mcr-1 led to colistin resistance in E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and A. baumannii but only moderately reduced susceptibility in P. aeruginosa Phosphoethanolamine modification of lipid A was observed consistently for all four species. These findings highlight the risk of colistin resistance as a consequence of mcr-1 expression among ESKAPE pathogens, especially in K. pneumoniae and A. baumannii Furthermore, the observation that lipid A structures were modified despite only modest increases in colistin MICs in some instances suggests more sophisticated surveillance methods may need to be developed to track the dissemination of mcr-1 or plasmid -mediated phosphoethanolamine transferases in general.

28373627|t|Effects of Transplanted Human Cord Blood - Mononuclear Cells on Pulmonary Hypertension in Immunodeficient Mice and Their Distribution
28373627|a|To investigate the effects of human umbilical cord blood -derived mononuclear cell (hUCB - MNC) transplantation on pulmonary hypertension (PH) induced by monocrotaline (MCT) in immunodeficient mice and their distribution. MCT was administered to BALB/c Slc-nu/nu mice, and PH was induced in mice 4 weeks later. Fresh hUCB - MNCs harvested from a human donor after her delivery were injected intravenously into those PH mice. The medial thickness of pulmonary arterioles, ratio of right ventricular to septum plus left ventricular weight (RV / S + LV), and ratio of acceleration time to ejection time of pulmonary blood flow waveform (AT / ET) were determined 4 weeks after hUCB - MNC transplantation. To reveal the incorporation into the lung, CMTMR - labeled hUCB - MNCs were observed in the lung by fluorescent microscopy. DiR-labeled hUCB - MNCs were detected in the lung and other organs by bioluminescence images. Medial thickness, RV / S + LV and AT / ET were significantly improved 4 weeks after hUCB - MNC transplantation compared with those in mice without hUCB - MNC transplantation. CMTMR - positive hUCB - MNCs were observed in the lung 3 hours after transplantation. Bioluminescence signals were detected more strongly in the lung than in other organs for 24 hours after transplantation. The results indicate that hUCB - MNCs are incorporated into the lung early after hUCB - MNC transplantation and improve MCT - induced PH. J. Med. Invest. 64: 43-49, February, 2017.

28376287|t|Recovery from alcohol dependence: Do smoking indicators predict abstinence?
28376287|a|There is inconsistent evidence about the potential influence of smoking on recovery from alcohol dependence. Our study aimed at assessing the impact of smoking-behavior on relapse during a 12 months follow-up period following a detoxification in patients with Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). Three hundred Patients with AUD (74.9% smoking) were recruited from two inpatient detoxification units in psychiatric hospitals in Germany and their alcohol consumption was prospectively followed for 1 year. Data on different indicators of smoking behavior was gathered. Cox regression model was used to evaluate potential risk factors on time to relapse of alcohol consumption. Two hundred seventy-nine participants (n = 279) were included in the final analysis. Smoking increased the risk for alcohol relapse (hazard ratio = 3.962, 95% CI 1.582-9.921). However, this increased risk is slightly reduced with higher numbers of daily consumed cigarettes (hazard ratio per cigarette = .986, 95% CI .976-.995). Smoking reduced the probability of maintaining alcohol abstinence significantly, whereas higher number of cigarettes smoked daily diminished the increased risk of alcohol relapse in alcohol-dependent patients. Coordinated psychiatric and substance abuse interventions for different subgroups of patients with AUD in the post-acute treatment phase are necessary. Individualized treatment planning is especially important in smoking patients with AUD who are vulnerable for a relapse to alcohol drinking and for somatic complications. Our findings might support individualized treatment plans .(Am J Addict 2017;XX:1-8).

Encoding and retrieval are supported by the engagement of both distinct neural pathways across the cortex and common structures within the medial temporal lobes. However, the degree to which memory performance can be determined by neural processing that is common to encoding and retrieval remains to be determined. To identify neural signatures of successful memory function, we administered a delayed free-recall task to 187 neurosurgical patients implanted with subdural or intraparenchymal depth electrodes. We developed multivariate classifiers to identify patterns of spectral power across the brain that independently predicted successful episodic encoding and retrieval. During encoding and retrieval, patterns of increased high frequency activity in prefrontal, MTL, and inferior parietal cortices, accompanied by widespread decreases in low frequency power across the brain predicted successful memory function. Using a cross-decoding approach, we demonstrate the ability to predict memory function across distinct phases of the free-recall task. Furthermore, we demonstrate that classifiers that combine information from both encoding and retrieval states can outperform task-independent models. These findings suggest that the engagement of a core memory network during either encoding or retrieval shapes the ability to remember the past, despite distinct neural interactions that facilitate encoding and retrieval.

28379026|t|Bilirubin and atherosclerotic diseases
28379026|a|Bilirubin is the final product of heme catabolism in the systemic circulation. For decades, increased serum / plasma bilirubin levels were considered an ominous sign of an underlying liver disease. However, data from recent years convincingly suggest that mildly elevated bilirubin concentrations are associated with protection against various oxidative stress -mediated diseases, atherosclerotic conditions being the most clinically relevant. Although scarce data on beneficial effects of bilirubin had been published also in the past, it took until 1994 when the first clinical study demonstrated an increased risk of coronary heart disease in subjects with low serum bilirubin levels, and bilirubin was found to be a risk factor for atherosclerotic diseases independent of standard risk factors. Consistent with these results, we proved in our own studies, that subjects with mild elevation of serum levels of unconjugated bilirubin (benign hyperbilirubinemia, Gilbert syndrome) have much lower prevalence / incidence of coronary heart as well as peripheral vascular disease. We have also demonstrated that this association is even more general, with serum bilirubin being a biomarker of numerous other diseases, often associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis. In addition, very recent data have demonstrated biological pathways modulated by bilirubin, which are responsible for observed strong clinical associations.

28379326|t|An Automated, Pharmacist -Driven Initiative Improves Quality of Care for Staphylococcus aureus Bacteremia
28379326|a|Infectious diseases (ID) consultation and antimicrobial stewardship intervention have been shown to improve the management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB). As the workload of antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) continues to increase, ASPs must find a way to maximize the efficiency of the program while optimizing patient outcomes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of incorporating health informatics into the management of SAB via a pharmacist -driven initiative. Retrospective, single-center quasi-experimental study of hospitalized patients with SAB. During the intervention period, pharmacists were alerted to patients with SAB via a patient scoring tool integrated into the electronic medical record. Pharmacists utilized the scoring tool and the institution's evidence-based practice guideline to make standardized recommendations to promote adherence to SAB quality-of-care measures and encourage ID consultation. The primary outcome was overall compliance along with adherence to individual quality-of-care components. Secondary clinical outcomes were also analyzed. 84 patients were identified for study inclusion, 45 in the pre- intervention and 39 in the intervention group. As a whole, all four quality-of-care components for the management of SAB were significantly more frequently adhered to in the intervention group (68.9% vs. 92.3%; P=0.008). The incidence of ID consult improved significantly by almost 20% in the intervention group (75.6% vs. 94.9%, P=0.015). No statistically significant differences in duration of bacteremia, length-of-stay, infection -related length-of-stay, or readmission were observed between the groups. The incidence of all-cause mortality was 6-fold higher in the pre- intervention group compared to the intervention group (15.6% vs. 2.6%, P=0.063). An automated, pharmacist -driven intervention for the management of patients with SAB demonstrated a significant improvement in patients receiving an ID consult, targeted antimicrobial therapy, and adherence to all SAB quality-of-care measures. As antimicrobial stewardship becomes a mandatory aspect of healthcare in all hospitals in the U.S., ASPs will be forced to find ways to provide more efficient, impactful, disease state-based patient care. Our study provides the framework for and data to support this intervention in one of the most clinically important infectious diseases.

28380662|a|Physiological significance of synaptic Zn(2+) signaling was examined at perforant pathway - CA1 pyramidal cell synapses. In vivo long-term potentiation (LTP) at perforant pathway - CA1 pyramidal cell synapses was induced using a recording electrode attached to a microdialysis probe and the recording region was locally perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) via the microdialysis probe. Perforant pathway LTP was not attenuated under perfusion with CaEDTA (10 mM), an extracellular Zn(2+) chelator, but attenuated under perfusion with ZnAF-2DA (50 μM), an intracellular Zn(2+) chelator, suggesting that intracellular Zn(2+) signaling is required for perforant pathway LTP. Even in rat brain slices bathed in CaEDTA in ACSF, intracellular Zn(2+) level, which was measured with intracellular ZnAF-2, was increased in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare where perforant pathway - CA1 pyramidal cell synapses were contained after tetanic stimulation. These results suggest that intracellular Zn(2+) signaling, which originates in internal stores/ proteins, is involved in LTP at perforant pathway - CA1 pyramidal cell synapses. Because the influx of extracellular Zn(2+), which originates in presynaptic Zn(2+) release, is involved in LTP at Schaffer collateral - CA1 pyramidal cell synapses, synapse -dependent Zn(2+) dynamics may be involved in plasticity of postsynaptic CA1 pyramidal cells.

28381880|t|20S immunoproteasomes remove formaldehyde - damaged cytoplasmic proteins suppressing caspase-independent cell death
28381880|a|Immunoproteasomes are known for their involvement in antigen presentation. However, their broad tissue presence and other evidence are indicative of nonimmune functions. We examined a role for immunoproteasomes in cellular responses to the endogenous and environmental carcinogen formaldehyde (FA) that binds to cytosolic and nuclear proteins producing proteotoxic stress and genotoxic DNA - histone crosslinks. We found that immunoproteasomes were important for suppression of a caspase-independent cell death and the long-term survival of FA-treated cells. All major genotoxic responses to FA, including replication inhibition and activation of the transcription factor p53 and the apical ATM and ATR kinases, were unaffected by immunoproteasome inactivity. Immunoproteasome inhibition enhanced activation of the cytosolic protein damage sensor HSF1, elevated levels of K48-polyubiquitinated cytoplasmic proteins and increased depletion of unconjugated ubiquitin. We further found that FA induced the disassembly of 26S immunoproteasomes, but not standard 26S proteasomes, releasing the 20S catalytic immunoproteasome. FA-treated cells also had higher amounts of small activators PA28αβ and PA28γ bound to 20S particles. Our findings highlight the significance of nonnuclear damage in FA injury and reveal a major role for immunoproteasomes in elimination of FA-damaged cytoplasmic proteins through ubiquitin - independent proteolysis.

28383311|t|Musculoskeletal pain profile of obese individuals attending a multidisciplinary weight management service
28383311|a|Obesity is associated with numerous chronic diseases, including musculoskeletal (MSK) pain, which impacts on quality of life (QoL). There is, however, limited research providing a comprehensive MSK pain profile of an obese cohort. This retrospective study utilized a patient database at a national weight management service (WMS). Following ethical approval, anonymized patient data were statistically analyzed to develop a pain profile, investigate relationships between pain, sleep, and function, and explore variables associated with having low back pain (LBP) and knee pain. Overall, 915 individuals attended the WMS from January 2011 to September 2015 [male, 35% (n=318; CI =32-38); female, 65% (n=597; CI =62-68); mean age 44.6]. Mean BMI was 50.7 kg/m2 [Class III obese (BMI ≥40 kg/m2), 92% (n=835; CI =91-94)]. Approximately 91% reported MSK pain: LBP, 69% (n=539; CI =65- 72) [mean NRS 7.4]; knee pain, 58% (n=447; CI =55-61) [mean NRS 6.8]. Class III obese and multi-site pain patients had lower QoL and physical activity levels, reduced sleep, and poorer physical function than less obese patients and those without pain (p<0.05). Relationships were found between demographic, pain, self-report, psychological, and functional measures (p<0.05). Patients who slept fewer hours and had poorer functional outcomes were more likely to have LBP; patients who were divorced, had lower QoL, and more frequent nocturia were more likely to have knee pain (p<0.05). Multi-site MSK pain is prevalent and severe in obese patients and is negatively associated with most self-report and functional outcomes. This high prevalence suggests pain management strategies must be considered when treating obesity.

28384898|t|Primary Management and Outcome - Open Laryngotracheal Trauma
28384898|a|Acute external injury to the larynx is both life threatening and a potential long term management challenge. As Otorhinolaryngologist we must be prepared and well versed to manage these patients. In our study seven patients of open laryngeal traumas were managed by primary closure. In five patients nature of injury was known in other two patients exact nature of injury was not known. After primary closure five patients with known injury survived and two patients with unknown injury died. As per our experience, we recommend primary closure, if the exact nature of injury is known as the outcome is definitely favourable.

28385001|t|Comparative kinematic gait analysis in young and old Beagle dogs
28385001|a|Age-related involution in dogs involves loss of muscle mass and changes in connective tissue and articular cartilage. The aim of this study was to examine whether an age-related influence on joint mobility can be detected in the absence of diseases. Five young (Ø 2.0 years) and five old (Ø 10.4 years) healthy and sound Beagle dogs were measured during locomotion on a treadmill by computer-assisted gait analysis. Angles of the shoulder, elbow, carpal, hip, stifle and tarsal joints were analyzed, including joint angle progression curves, minimum and maximum joint angles and range of motion (ROM). The old group showed a smaller maximum joint angle (p = 0.037) and ROM (p = 0.037) of the carpal joint and similar tendencies in the shoulder, elbow and carpal joint. The descriptive analysis of the progression curves revealed less flexion and extension of the joints of the forelimb. This indicates restricted joint mobility of the forelimb but primarily of the carpal joint. Findings in the joints of the hindlimb were not consistent; contrasting alterations may be due to a compensatory mechanism. As most alterations were found in the distal joints, these should receive particular attention when examining elderly dogs.

28385075|t|Propensity Score Matched Comparison of Partial to Whole Gland Cryotherapy for Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer: An analysis of the COLD registry data
28385075|a|To compare the oncological and functional outcomes of partial versus whole - gland cryotherapy for men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer. Men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with primary prostate cryotherapy from 1993-2013 were selected from the Cryo On-Line Data Registry for a 1:1 matched comparison between those undergoing whole - gland and partial prostate cryotherapy (targeted-ablation, unilateral/bilateral nerve-sparing ablations). A propensity score was developed based on age, pre-biopsy serum PSA, biopsy Gleason score, clinical stage, prostate volume, neoadjuvant androgen deprivation status, year of surgery and pre-treatment potency. Outcomes were biochemical progression-free survival (BPFS) using ASTRO and Phoenix criteria, 12-month continence (strictly pad-free) and sexual function (potency sufficient for sexual intercourse). After propensity score - matching, BPFS was compared using Kaplan-Meier analysis and functional outcomes using chi-square tests. In all, 897 men were identified (731 whole - gland and 166 partial). Post-matching, 166 pairs of men were analysed (mean follow-up 31 months). The 2/5 year BPFS rate was 87.2%/76.4% for whole - gland vs. 80.7%/70.0% for partial ablation using Phoenix (p=0.26) and 72.3%/69.6% for whole gland vs. 82.1%/75.0% for partial ablation using ASTRO criteria (p=0.10). Of 164 pairs, the 12-month continence rate was similar 94.1% vs. 95.1% (p=0.803). Of 139 pairs, the 12-month rate of successful intercourse was 29.5% for whole - gland and 46.8% for partial ablation (OR 2.1, p=0.003). The incidence of post-treatment urinary retention was 6.0% and 6.6% (p=0.88) following whole - gland and partial ablation respectively and that of rectourethral fistula was 1.2% and 0% (p=0.50) Conclusion: Partial ablation results in better post-treatment sexual function compared to whole - gland ablation in men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer. We did not observe a difference in early BPFS between the two groups.

28386687|t|Abnormal metabolic brain network associated with Parkinson's disease: replication on a new European sample
28386687|a|The purpose of this study was to identify the specific metabolic brain pattern characteristic for Parkinson's disease (PD): Parkinson's disease-related pattern (PDRP), using network analysis of [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) brain images in a cohort of Slovenian PD patients. Twenty PD patients (age 70.1 ± 7.8 years, Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Motor Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS-III) 38.3 ± 12.2; disease duration 4.3 ± 4.1 years) and 20 age - matched normal controls (NCs) underwent FDG-PET brain imaging. An automatic voxel-based scaled subprofile model / principal component analysis (SSM / PCA) was applied to these scans for PDRP - Slovenia identification. The pattern was characterized by relative hypermetabolism in pallidum, putamen, thalamus, brain stem, and cerebellum associated with hypometabolism in sensorimotor cortex, posterior parietal, occipital, and frontal cortices. The expression of PDRP - Slovenia discriminated PD patients from NCs (p < 0.0001) and correlated positively with patients ' clinical score (MDS-UPDRS-III, p = 0.03). Additionally, its topography agrees well with the original PDRP (p < 0.001) identified in American cohort of PD patients. We validated the PDRP - Slovenia expression on additional FDG-PET scans of 20 PD patients, 20 NCs, and 25 patients with atypical parkinsonism (AP). We confirmed that the expression of PDRP - Slovenia manifests good diagnostic accuracy with specificity and sensitivity of 85-90% at optimal pattern expression cutoff for discrimination of PD patients and NCs and is not expressed in AP. PDRP - Slovenia proves to be a robust and reproducible functional imaging biomarker independent of patient population. It accurately differentiates PD patients from NCs and AP and correlates well with the clinical measure of PD progression.

28386942|t|The effects of gestational use of antidepressants and antipsychotics on neonatal outcomes for women with severe mental illness
28386942|a|Psychotropic medication use occurs in 8% of pregnancies, with rates increasing, and often multiple medications prescribed. This study aims to determine if the use of psychotropic medication, in a cohort of women with severe mental illness, increases rates of special care nursery admission and reports differences between antidepressant and antipsychotic medication use either alone or in combination. A retrospective database analysis from a cohort with severe mental illness in pregnancy identified 268 pregnant women who were grouped according to medication type. Demographic, obstetric and neonatal variables were analysed using t-tests, χ(2), analysis of variance and logistic regression analysis for special care nursery admission. The medication groups consisted of: women taking no psychotropic medications (n = 67); those taking antipsychotics (n = 87); those taking antidepressants (n = 55); those taking and a combination of antidepressants/antipsychotics (n = 59). Rates of special care nursery admission in women who took psychotropic medication (41.3%) were elevated compared to those who did not (26.9%) (P = 0.035), and were significantly raised when compared to the general population (P < 0.000). No significant difference occurred between the medication groups. A significant adjusted odds ratio of 2.79 (95% CI 1.286-6.049) was found for special care nursery and psychiatric admission during pregnancy but not for psychotropic medication. Rates of special care nursery admission are elevated in neonates of women with severe mental illness taking psychotropic medication, but were not different for monotherapy or polytherapy when prescribing antidepressants or antipsychotic medication. Additional vulnerability occurs in the neonates of women with a mental illness and paediatric presence at delivery is recommended.

28387851|t|Does Intrawound Vancomycin Application During Spine Surgery Create Vancomycin-Resistant Organism?
28387851|a|Surgical site infection (SSI) following spine surgery is a morbid and expensive complication. The use of intrawound vancomycin is emerging as a solution to reduce SSI. The development of vancomycin-resistant pathogens is an understandable concern. To determine the occurrence of vancomycin-resistant SSI in patients with and without use of intrawound vancomycin. Patients undergoing elective spine surgery were dichotomized based on whether intrawound vancomycin was applied. Outcome was occurrence of SSI requiring return to the operating room within postoperative 90 days. The intrawound culture and vancomycin minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were reviewed. Analyses were conducted to compare the pathogen profile and MIC for vancomycin in patients who received vancomycin and those who did not. Of the total 2802 patients, 43% (n = 1215) had intrawound vancomycin application during the index surgery. The use of vancomycin was associated with significantly lower deep SSI rates (1.6% [n = 20] vs 2.5% [n = 40], P = .02). The occurrence of Staphylococcus aureus SSI was significantly lower in the patients who had application of intrawound vancomycin (32% vs 65%, P = .003). None of the patients who had application of intrawound vancomycin powder, and subsequently developed an S aureus SSI, demonstrated pathogens with resistance to vancomycin. All patients had MIC < 2 μg/mL, the vancomycin susceptibility threshold. The occurrence of gram-negative SSI (28% vs 7%) and culture negative fluid collection (16% vs 5%) was higher in the vancomycin cohort. The use of intrawound vancomycin during the index spine surgery was protective against SSI following spine surgery. The application of intrawound vancomycin during index surgery does not appear to create vancomycin-resistant organisms in the event of an SSI.

28388017|t|Adequacy criteria for thyroid FNA evaluated by ThinPrep slides only
28388017|a|Adequacy criteria for thyroid fine-needle aspiration (FNA) recommended by The Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology (TBS) were developed with smears, but they are commonly applied to ThinPreps (TPs). This study evaluated adequacy in TPs at different diagnostic thresholds. All FNA procedures performed between 2010 and 2015 with matched surgical specimens were analyzed. Cell counts and cytological features were evaluated in all initially nondiagnostic (ND) cases. ND cases were reclassified into TBS categories by 2 pathologists, and the results were compared with surgical outcomes. One hundred forty-six of the 151 cases initially classified as ND were available for review, and they had a mean cell count of 60.5 (standard deviation, 71.4). Interobserver agreement on the reclassification of ND cases was moderate (k = 0.57), and consensus yielded 48 ND cases (33%), 72 benign cases (49%), 24 cases of atypia of undetermined significance (16%), and 2 cases suspicious for malignancy (1%). Lowering the diagnostic threshold to any follicular cells yielded a sensitivity of 92%, a specificity of 60%, a positive predictive value of 59%, a negative predictive value of 92%, and a false-negative rate of 7.7%, whereas the values for the initially diagnostic cases were 93%, 58%, 59%, 93%, and 7.7%, respectively. Including cases with >60 cells but lacking 6 groups containing at least 10 cells did not affect test performance. Nuclear enlargement, pallor, grooves, and the presence of histiocytoid cells in initially ND FNA correlated with malignancy. In thyroid FNA examined with TP only, lowering the adequacy threshold and eliminating the requirement of 6 groups of at least 10 cells did not significantly affect test performance if cytological features associated with malignancy were absent.

28389368|t|Silk I and Silk II studied by fast scanning calorimetry
28389368|a|Using fast scanning calorimetry (FSC), we investigated the glass transition and crystal melting of samples of B. mori silk fibroin containing Silk I and/or Silk II crystal s. Due to the very short residence times at high temperatures during such measurements, thermal decomposition of silk protein can be significantly suppressed. FSC was performed at 2000K/s using the Mettler Flash DSC1 on fibroin films with masses around 130-270ng. Films were prepared with different crystalline fractions (ranging from 0.26 to 0.50) and with different crystal structures (Silk I, Silk II, or mixed) by varying the processing conditions. These included water annealing at different temperatures, exposure to 50% MeOH in water, or autoclaving. The resulting crystal structure was examined using wide angle X-ray scattering. Degree of crystallinity was evaluated from Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and from analysis of the heat capacity increment at the glass transition temperature. Silk fibroin films prepared by water annealing at 25°C were the least crystalline and had Silk I structure. FTIR and FSC studies showed that films prepared by autoclaving or 50% MeOH exposure were the most crystalline and had Silk II structure. Intermediate crystalline fraction and mixed Silk I / Silk II structure s were found in films prepared by water annealing at 37°C. FSC results indicate that Silk I I crystals exhibit endotherms of narrower width and have higher mean melting temperature Tm(II)=351±2.6°C, compared to Silk I crystals which melt at Tm(I)=292±3.8°C. Films containing mixed Silk I / Silk II structure showed two clearly separated endothermic peaks. Evidence suggests that the two types of crystal s melt separately and do not thermal ly interconvert on the extremely short time scale (0.065s between onset and end of melting) of the FSC experiment. Silkworm silk is a naturally occurring biomaterial. The fibroin component of silk forms two types of crystals. Silk properties depend upon the amount and type of crystals, and their stability. One measure of stability is crystal melting temperature. Crystal s which are more stable have a higher melting temperature. Until now, it has been challenging to study thermal behavior of silk crystal s because they degrade at high temperature. To avoid degradation, and study the melting properties of silk biomaterial, we heated silk at a very fast rate of 2000K/s using a special calorimeter. We have shown that the two crystal types have very different melting temperature s, indicating that one crystal type is much more stable than the other.

28389633|t|Leonurine Attenuates Hyperalgesia in Mice with Induced Adenomyosis
28389633|a|BACKGROUND Adenomyosis, defined as the invasion of endometrial glands and stroma into the myometrium, is a common gynecological disorder. In the present study we report on the effect of leonurine on ICR mice with adenomyosis induced by neonatal tamoxifen. MATERIAL AND METHODS After being treated with tamoxifen for 4, 8, and 12 weeks, we assessed body weight and pain modulation in mice in hotplate tests. The mice were divided into 5 groups: a low-dose leonurine treatment group, a high-dose leonurine treatment group, a valproic acid (VPA) treatment group, a vehicle only treatment group, and a blank control group. We evaluated body weight, pain modulation in hotplate tests, and the depth of myometrial infiltration. Immunoreactivity staining of progesterone receptor (PR), nuclear factor-κB phosphorylated-p65 (p-p65), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and oxytocin receptor (OTR) was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS The measurement of the body weight, myometrial infiltration, and pain modulation showed that neonatal tamoxifen treatment led to adenomyosis. Leonurine treatment appeared to decrease hyperalgesia and myometrial infiltration. Immunoreactivity staining showed decreased p-p65, COX-2, and OTR protein expressions. CONCLUSIONS Our results indicate that leonurine attenuates hyperalgesia in mice with induced adenomyosis via down-regulating expressions of p-P65, COX-2, and OTR, and could be beneficial for treating adenomyosis.

28394217|t|A Randomized, Head-to-Head Study of Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder
28394217|a|Virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) is one of the few interventions supported by randomized controlled trials for the treatment of combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in active duty service members. A comparative effectiveness study was conducted to determine if virtual reality technology itself improved outcomes, or if similar results could be achieved with a control exposure therapy (CET) condition. Service members with combat-related PTSD were randomly selected to receive nine weeks of VRET or CET. Assessors, but not therapists, were blinded. PTSD symptom improvement was assessed one week and 3 months after the conclusion of treatment using the clinician-administered PTSD scale (CAPS). A small crossover component was included. Results demonstrated that PTSD symptoms improved with both treatments, but there were no statistically significant differences between groups. Dropout rates were higher in VRET. Of those who received VRET, 13/42 (31%) showed >30% improvement on the CAPS, versus 16/43 (37%) who received CET. Three months after treatment, >30% improvement was seen in 10/33 (30%) of VRET participants and 12/33 (36%) in CET. Participants who crossed over (n = 11) showed no statistically significant improvements in a second round of treatment, regardless of condition. This study supported the utility of exposure therapy for PTSD, but did not support additional benefit by the inclusion of virtual reality.

28394503|t|Accounting for linkage disequilibrium in genome scans for selection without individual genotypes: The local score approach
28394503|a|Detecting genomic footprints of selection is an important step in the understanding of evolution. Accounting for linkage disequilibrium in genome scans increases detection power, but haplotype -based methods require individual genotypes and are not applicable on pool-sequenced samples. We propose to take advantage of the local score approach to account for linkage disequilibrium in genome scans for selection, cumulating (possibly small) signals from single markers over a genomic segment, to clearly pinpoint a selection signal. Using computer simulations, we demonstrate that this approach detects selection with higher power than several state-of-the-art single-marker, windowing or haplotype -based approaches. We illustrate this on two benchmark data sets including individual genotypes, for which we obtain similar results with the local score and one haplotype -based approach. Finally, we apply the local score approach to Pool-Seq data obtained from a divergent selection experiment on behaviour in quail and obtain precise and biologically coherent selection signals: while competing methods fail to highlight any clear selection signature, our method detects several regions involving genes known to act on social responsiveness or autistic traits. Although we focus here on the detection of positive selection from multiple population data, the local score approach is general and can be applied to other genome scans for selection or other genomewide analyses such as GWAS.

28394602|t|Is UV - Induced Electron-Driven Proton Transfer Active in a Chemically Modified A · T DNA Base Pair?
28394602|a|Transient electronic and vibrational absorption spectroscopies have been used to investigate whether UV - induced electron-driven proton transfer (EDPT) mechanisms are active in a chemically modified adenine - thymine (A · T) DNA base pair. To enhance the fraction of biologically relevant Watson-Crick (WC) hydrogen-bonding motifs and eliminate undesired Hoogsteen structures, a chemically modified derivative of A was synthesized, 8-(tert-butyl)-9-ethyladenine (8tBA). Equimolar solutions of 8tBA and silyl-protected T nucleosides in chloroform yield a mixture of WC pairs, reverse WC pairs, and residual monomers. Unlike previous transient absorption studies of WC guanine - cytosin e (G · C) pairs, no clear spectroscopic or kinetic evidence was identified for the participation of EDPT in the excited-state relaxation dynamics of 8tBA · T pairs, although ultrafast (sub-100 fs) EDPT cannot be discounted. Monomer-like dynamics are proposed to dominate in 8tBA · T.

28395554|t|Monitoring proteolytic processing events by quantitative mass spectrometry
28395554|a|Protease activity plays a key role in a wide variety of biological processes including gene expression, protein turnover and development. misregulation of these proteins has been associated with many cancer types such as prostate, breast, and skin cancer. thus, the identification of protease substrates will provide key information to understand proteolysis -related pathologies. Areas covered: Proteomics -based methods to investigate proteolysis activity, focusing on substrate identification, protease specificity and their applications in systems biology are reviewed. Their quantification strategies, challenges and pitfalls are underlined and the biological implications of protease malfunction are highlighted. Expert commentary: Dysregulated protease activity is a hallmark for some disease pathologies such as cancer. Current biochemical approaches are low throughput and some are limited by the amount of sample required to obtain reliable results. Mass spectrometry based proteomics provides a suitable platform to investigate protease activity, providing information about substrate specificity and mapping cleavage sites.

28396744|t|Diabetic nephropathy as the cause of end-stage kidney disease reported on the medical evidence form CMS2728 at a single center
28396744|a|Background: End-stage renal disease (ESRD) incidence due to Type 2 diabetic nephropathy (DN) is 35-50%, according to the United States Renal Data System. Methods: A single- center, retrospective cohort study to determine incidence and diagnostic accuracy for Type 2 DN as the primary cause of ESRD (Code 250.40) on the Center for Medicare & Medicaid (CMS) Medical Evidence Report form (CMS2728) submitted at renal replacement therapy initiation. All patients ≥18 years of age with a CMS2728 submitted between 1 March 2006 and 31 March 2015 at a single academic military medical center (ESRD Network 5) were included. Medical records of those with a Code 250.40 diagnosis were reviewed to determine whether they met the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) 2007 criteria for DN. Results: ESRD incidence secondary to Type 2 DN was 18.7% (56/299 individual CMS2728 submissions over 9.09 years). In all, 12/56 (21.4%) did not meet KDOQI criteria for Type 2 DN. Although all had diabetes, those not meeting criteria had shorter disease duration (P = 0.007), were more likely to have active urine sediment (P = 0.006), and were less likely to have macroalbuminuria (P = 0.037) or retinopathy (P = 0.002) prior to ESRD. On exact logistic regression, retinopathy was significantly associated with KDOQI -predicted DN [odds ratio = 19.16 (confidence interval 2.76-223.7), P = 0.0009]. Conclusions: In this single- center cohort, 21.4% identified as having Type 2 DN as the primary cause of ESRD were incorrectly assigned per KDOQI 2007 clinical criteria. If replicated in larger populations, this could have substantial implications regarding the epidemiology of ESRD in the USA.

28397533|t|Socioeconomic Predictors of Adherence Behavior Among HIV-Positive Patients Receiving Antiretroviral Therapy in Selangor, Malaysia
28397533|a|Medication adherence remains a critical link between the prescribed ART regimen and treatment outcome. Several factors may influence adherence behavior. This cross-sectional study aimed to highlight socioeconomic predictors of adherence behavior among a cohort of 242 adult Malaysian patients receiving antiretroviral therapy in Hospital Sungai Buloh, Malaysia, where they were enrolled in a parent study (single-blinded randomized controlled trial) between January and December 2014. Statistical analysis of secondary data on adherence behavior and sociodemographic characteristics of the patients revealed mean age of 33.4 years and ranged from 18 to 64 years; 88.8% were males. A total of 224 (93%) patients who completed 6 months' adherence assessment were included in the model. Of these, 135 (60.3%) achieved optimal adherence. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis revealed that patient's income and ethnicity were significant predictors of adherence behavior. This may be valuable for targeted programmatic interventions to further enhance successful treatment outcomes among the target population.

28399372|t|A Tobramycin Vector Enhances Synergy and Efficacy of Efflux Pump Inhibitors against Multidrug-Resistant Gram-Negative Bacteria
28399372|a|Drug efflux mechanisms interact synergistically with the outer membrane permeability barrier of Gram-negative bacteria, leading to intrinsic resistance that presents a major challenge for antibiotic drug development. Efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs) which block the efflux of antibiotics synergize antibiotics, but the clinical development of EPI / antibiotic combination therapy to treat multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative infections has been challenging. This is in part caused by the inefficiency of current EPIs to penetrate the outer membrane and resist efflux. We demonstrate that conjugation of a tobramycin (TOB) vector to EPIs like NMP, paroxetine, or DBP enhances synergy and efficacy of EPIs in combination with tetracycline antibiotics against MDR Gram-negative bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Besides potentiating tetracycline antibiotics, TOB - EPI conjugates can also suppress resistance development to the tetracycline antibiotic minocycline, thereby providing a strategy to develop more effective adjuvants to rescue tetracycline antibiotics from resistance in MDR Gram-negative bacteria.

28400582|t|Detection of AMA-M2 in human saliva: Potentials in diagnosis and monitoring of primary biliary cholangitis
28400582|a|Serum anti-mitochondrial antibody type 2 (AMA-M2) is considered as a pivotal biomarker for the diagnosis of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). However, serological tests have many limitations, including inconvenience, invasiveness, and infection risks. Thus, a less invasive approach to detect AMA-M2 titer is desirable. We examined salivary AMA-M2 of potential PBC patients and found that AMA-M2 could be detected only in saliva of serum AMA-M2-positive PBC patients, but not in saliva of serum AMA-M2-negative PBC patients, oral lichen planus patients (OLP) patients, or healthy controls. Furthermore, the concentration of salivary AMA-M2 was positively correlated with the amount of serum AMA-M2 in patients. The salivary inflammatory cytokines were increased in the PBC, consistent with the results of serum test. These findings indicated that saliva might be a less invasive and cost-effective medium to accurately test for AMA-M2 levels and this is a promising development for the diagnosis and monitoring of PBC.

28402002|t|Mental health and associated factors among young offenders in Chile: a cross-sectional study
28402002|a|Few studies in Latin America have explored mental disorder among young offenders, or variables associated with it. Our aim was to test for associations between childhood adversity or substance misuse and psychiatric disorders among young offenders. Sentenced adolescent offenders were recruited from young offenders' institutions or community centres provided by the Chilean National Service for Minors. Psychiatric disorders were assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, conducted by trained psychologists. A trained sociologist used an ad hoc interview to collect information about childhood experiences, including parenting, trauma, education and substance misuse. Multivariable logistic regressions were used to analyse data. The most prevalent psychiatric disorders among the 935 participants were marijuana dependence disorder, major depressive disorder, and anxiety disorders. Substance use disorders were less frequent among young offenders who were serving their sentence in young offenders' institutions than among those serving in community centres and more frequent among those who started to use marijuana at an earlier age. Among other variables, childhood maltreatment was related to major depressive disorder, and maternal death to anxiety disorders. Higher educational status was related to a lower frequency of depressive and anxiety disorders. Our findings suggest that greater efforts must be made to identify vulnerable young people much earlier. Few of these young offenders with mental health problems had been well adjusted in health, education or socially before this period of detention. © 2017 The Authors.

28402055|t|Effects of regular water - and land-based exercise on physical function after 5 years: A long-term study on the well-being of older Japanese adults
28402055|a|To investigate the effects of 5 years of physical exercise on functional parameters among older Japanese adults who carried out water - or land-based exercise. We retrospectively investigated data from 5707 medical examinations and enrolled 77 older adults into the study. Eligible participants had to be aged ≥60 years, and engaged in water-based exercise (n = 38) or a combination of water - and land-based exercise (n = 39) for at least 80% of their total exercise time for over 5 years at our fitness center. In statistical analysis, a two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance was carried out to examine the effects over time and by exercise type, and the changes in each parameter over 5 years were also compared between the two groups. We found significant main effects and an interaction between time and exercise type for gait speed, with an early decline in the combined exercise group, as well as significant main effects of time, showing a functional decline in grip strength, one-leg standing time and step/height ratio in both exercise types at the 5- year follow up. The 5- year changes in each parameter did not differ between the two groups despite the frequency of exercise, even though we found a negative correlation between changes in one-leg standing time and total amount of water-based exercise. Contrary to expectations, these results suggest that regular engagement in water-based exercise, even combined with land-based exercise, might have poor long-term benefits for maintaining physical performance in older adults.

28402232|t|Combined exposures of whole-body vibration and awkward posture: a cross sectional investigation among occupational drivers by means of simultaneous field measurements
28402232|a|Multifactorial workloads such as whole-body vibration (WBV), awkward posture and heavy lifting are potential predictors for low back pain (LBP). In this study, we investigate the association between LBP and these exposures among 102 professional drivers. The combined exposures of WBV and posture are measured at different workplaces. Health and personal data as well as information about lifting tasks are collected by a questionnaire. The daily vibration exposure value (odds ratio 1.69) and an index for awkward posture (odds ratio 1.63) show significant association with the occurence of LBP. Awkward posture and heavy lifting appear to be more strongly associated with sick leave than WBV exposure. Furthermore, a combination of the measurement results of WBV and awkward posture into one quantity also shows significant correlation to LBP. The combined exposure of WBV and awkward posture can be described in terms of the daily vibration exposure and the index for awkward posture. This facilitates work place assessments and future research in this area. Practitioner Summary: For the first time, quantitative measures combining whole-body vibration and awkward posture exposures have shown to correlate with the occurrence of low back pain significantly. This validates the proposed quantities and measurement methods, which facilitate workplace assessments and assist in the design of further studies which are necessary to establish a causal exposure - response relationship.

28402261|t|Association of CKIP-1 P21A polymorphism with risk of chronic heart failure in a Chinese population
28402261|a|Pathological cardiac hypertrophy is an independent risk factor for chronic heart failure. Casein kinase-2 interacting protein-1 (CKIP-1) can inhibit pathological cardiac hypertrophy. Therefore, we investigated whether CKIP-1 nonsynonymous polymorphism rs2306235 (Pro21Ala) contributes to risk and prognosis of chronic heart failure in a Chinese population. A total of 923 adult patients with chronic heart failure and 1020 age - and gender -matched healthy controls were recruited. CKIP-1 rs2306235 polymorphism was genotyped using PCR - restriction fragment length polymorphism. Additional follow-up data for 140 chronic heart failure patients was evaluated. The rs2306235 G allele was associated with an increased risk of chronic heart failure (OR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.09-1.75, p = 0.007), especially in patients with hypertension (OR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.09-1.75, p = 0.006) and coronary heart disease (OR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.09-1.83, p = 0.010) after adjustment for multiple cardiovascular risk factors. However, rs2306235 polymorphism was not associated with cardiovascular mortality in chronic heart failure (p = 0.875). CKIP-1 rs2306235 polymorphism may be a risk factor for chronic heart failure in a Chinese Han population.

28403152|t|Linking phenological events in migratory passerines with a changing climate: 50 years in the Laurel Highlands of Pennsylvania
28403152|a|Advanced timing of both seasonal migration and reproduction in birds has been strongly associated with a warming climate for many bird species. Phenological responses to climate linking these stages may ultimately impact fitness. We analyzed five decades of banding data from 17 migratory bird species to investigate 1) how spring arrival related to timing of breeding, 2) if the interval between arrival and breeding has changed with increasing spring temperatures, and 3) whether arrival timing or breeding timing best predicted local productivity. Four of 17 species, all mid- to long-distance migrants, hatched young earlier in years when migrants arrived earlier to the breeding grounds (~1:1 day advancement). The interval between arrival on breeding grounds and appearance of juveniles shortened with warmer spring temperatures for 12 species (1-6 days for every 1°C increase) and over time for seven species (1-8 days per decade), suggesting that some migratory passerines adapt to climate change by laying more quickly after arrival or reducing the time from laying to fledging. We found more support for the former, that the rate of reproductive advancement was higher than that for arrival in warm years. Timing of spring arrival and breeding were both poor predictors of avian productivity for most migrants analyzed. Nevertheless, we found evidence that fitness benefits may occur from shifts to earlier spring arrival for the multi-brooded Song Sparrow. Our results uniquely demonstrate that co-occurring avian species are phenologically plastic in their response to climate change on their breeding grounds. If migrants continue to show a weaker response to temperatures during migration than breeding, and the window between arrival and optimal breeding shortens further, biological constraints to plasticity may limit the ability of species to adapt successfully to future warming.

28404634|t|Mucosal IgM Antibody with d-Mannose Affinity in Fugu Takifugu rubripes Is Utilized by a Monogenean Parasite Heterobothrium okamotoi for Host Recognition
28404634|a|How parasites recognize their definitive hosts is a mystery; however, parasitism is reportedly initiated by recognition of certain molecules on host surfaces. Fish ectoparasites make initial contact with their hosts at body surfaces, such as skin and gills, which are covered with mucosa that are similar to those of mammalian guts. Fish are among the most primitive vertebrates with immune systems that are equivalent to those in mammals, and they produce and secrete IgM into mucus. In this study, we showed that the monogenean parasite Heterobothrium okamotoi utilizes IgM to recognize its host, fugu Takifugu rubripes Oncomiracidia are infective larvae of H. okamotoi that shed their cilia and metamorphose into juveniles when exposed to purified d-mannose - binding fractions from fugu mucus. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, proteins contained in the fraction were identified as d-mannose -specific IgM with two d-mannose -binding lectins. However, although deciliation was significantly induced by IgM and was inhibited by d-mannose or a specific Ab against fugu IgM, other lectins had no effect, and IgM without d-mannose affinity induced deciliation to a limited degree. Subsequent immunofluorescent staining experiments showed that fugu d-mannose -specific IgM binds ciliated epidermal cells of oncomiracidium. These observations suggest that deciliation is triggered by binding of fugu IgM to cell surface Ags via Ag binding sites. Moreover, concentrations of d-mannose - binding IgM in gill mucus were sufficient to induce deciliation in vitro, indicating that H. okamotoi parasites initially use host Abs to colonize host gills.

28404899|t|BALB/c mice immunized with a combination of virus-like particles incorporating Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) envelope glycoproteins gpK8.1, gB, and gH / gL induced comparable serum neutralizing antibody activity to UV - inactivated KSHV
28404899|a|Infection with Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is estimated to account for over 44,000 new cases of Kaposi sarcoma annually, with 84% occurring in Africa, where the virus is endemic. To date, there is no prophylactic vaccine against KSHV. KSHV gpK8.1, gB, and gH / gL glycoproteins, implicated in the virus entry into host cells, are attractive vaccine targets for eliciting potent neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against virus infection. We incorporated gpK8.1, gB, or gH / gL on the surface of virus-like particles (VLPs) and characterized these VLPs for their composition, size, and functionality. To determine which viral glycoprotein(s) elicit the most effective serum - nAbs, we immunized BALB/c mice with gpK8.1, gB, or gH / gL VLPs individually or in combination. Neutralizing antibody assay revealed that sera from mice immunized with the VLPs inhibited KSHV infection of HEK-293 cells in a dose-dependent manner. As a single immunogen, gpK8.1 VLPs stimulated comparable nAb activity to that of UV - inactivated KSHV (UV-KSHV). In contrast, UV-KSHV stimulated higher titers of nAb compared to gB (p = 0.0316) or gH / gL (p = 0.0486). Mice immunized with the combination of gB and gH / gL VLPs had a better nAb response than those immunized with either gB (p = 0.0268), or gH /gL (p = 0.0397) as single VLP immunogens. Immunization with any VLP combination stimulated comparable nAb activity to UV-KSHV serum. Our data provide the first evidence that KSHV gpK8.1, gB, and gH / gL glycoproteins can be incorporated onto the surface of VLPs and used as prophylactic vaccine candidates, with potential to prevent KSHV infection.

28405013|t|A missense variant, rs373863828-A (p.Arg457Gln), of CREBRF and body mass index in Oceanic populations
28405013|a|It has been suggested that a 'thrifty' genotype hypothesis can account for high prevalence of obesity in the island populations of Oceania. A recent genome-wide association study revealed that a missense variant, rs373863828-A (p.Arg457Gln), of the CREBRF gene (encoding CREB3 regulatory factor) was associated with an excessive increase in body mass index (BMI) in Samoans. In the present study, the association of rs373863828-A with an increase in BMI was examined in four Austronesian (AN)- speaking populations in Oceania. We found that rs373863828-A was frequently observed (frequency of 0.15) in Tongans (Polynesians), and was strongly associated with higher BMI (P=6.1 × 10(-4)). A single copy of the rs373863828-A allele increased BMI by 3.09 kg m(-2) after adjustment of age and sex. No significant association was detected in the other three AN - speaking populations (Melanesians and Micronesians) living in Solomon Islands. This was probably due to the low allele frequency (0.02-0.06) of rs373863828-A as well as small sample size. The rs373863828-A allele was not found in both AN - speaking and non- AN - speaking Melanesians living in Papua New Guinea.

28405450|t|Vaccination of piglets at 2 and 3 weeks of age with Ingelvac PRRSFLEX® EU provides protection against heterologous field challenge in the face of homologous maternally derived antibodies
28405450|a|Due to difficulties in eradicating porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) linked to biosecurity challenges, transmission of the virus and the lack of efficient DIVA vaccines, successful control of PRRS requires a combination of strict management measures and vaccination of both sows and piglets. The present study aimed to assess the efficacy of a recently developed MLV vaccine (Ingelvac PRRSFLEX® EU) in piglets at 2 and 3-weeks of age in the presence of homologous maternally derived antibodies as the dams were vaccinated with the same vaccine strain (ReproCyc® PRRS EU). The study was carried out on a Hungarian farrow to finish farm naturally infected with PRRSv. The study was designed as a blind, placebo controlled side by side trial. ORF5 sequence similarity of the vaccine strain and the resident field strain was 87.8 %. PRRS specific real-time quantitative PCR was performed from serum samples to measure both the viral load and the frequency of virus positive animals. At the time of the natural infection observed in the control group at 10-12 weeks of age, the number of viraemic animals did not increase significantly in the vaccinated group. To understand the infection dynamics, positive PCR samples with low Ct values were sequenced (ORF5) and the data analysis indicated the circulation of wild type virus in both groups, however wild type virus was only found in non-vaccinated animals. Our data indicate that piglets vaccinated at as early as 2 weeks of age with Ingelvac PRRSFLEX® EU were protected both in terms of proportion of viraemic animals and viraemia levels. It has to be highlighted that these results were achieved in piglets with high levels of homologous maternally derived antibodies (MDA) at the time of vaccination.

28407625|t|Comparison of Occlusive and Open Application in a Psoriasis Plaque Test Design, Exemplarily Using Investigations of Mapracorat 0.1% Ointment versus Vehicle and Reference Drugs
28407625|a|Psoriasis plaque tests (PPTs) are important tools in the early phases of antipsoriatic drug development. Two distinct PPT design variants (open vs. occluded drug application) are commonly used, but no previous work has aimed to directly compare and contrast their performance. We compared the antipsoriatic efficacy of mapracorat 0.1% ointment and reference drugs reported in 2 separate studies, representing open and occluded PPT designs. The drug effect size was measured by sonography (mean change in echo-poor band thickness), chromametry, and standardized clinical assessment. Antipsoriatic effects were detectable for the study drugs in both occluded and open PPTs. Differences between the potency of antipsoriatic drugs and vehicle were observable. The total antipsoriatic effect size appeared to be higher in the occluded PPT than the open PPT, despite the shorter treatment duration (2 vs. 4 weeks). Effect dynamics over time revealed greater differences between some study drugs in the open PPT compared to the occluded PPT. Taking the higher technical challenges for the open PPT into account, we recommend the occluded PPT as a standard screening setting in early drug development. In special cases, considering certain drug aspects or study objectives that would require procedural adaptations, an open PPT could be the better-suited design. Finally, both PPT models show clear advantages: classification as phase I studies, small number of psoriatic subjects, relatively short study duration, excellent discrimination between compounds and concentrations, parallel measurement of treatment response, and go/no go decisions very early in clinical development.

28407650|t|Insurance Coverage and Utilization at a Sexually Transmitted Disease Clinic in a Medicaid Expansion State
28407650|a|In Rhode Island, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has led to over 95% of the state's population being insured. We evaluated insurance coverage and barriers to insurance use among patients presenting for services at the Rhode Island sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic. We analyzed factors associated with insurance coverage and utilization among patients presenting for STD services between July and December 2015. A total of 692 patients had insurance information available; of those, 40% were uninsured. Patients without insurance were more likely than those with insurance to be nonwhite (50% among uninsured, compared with 40% among insured; P = 0.014) and Hispanic or Latino/a (25%, compared with 16%; P = 0.006), and less likely to be men who have sex with men (27%, compared with 39%; P = 0.001). Of those with health insurance, 26% obtained coverage as a result of the Affordable Care Act, and 56% of those were previously uninsured. Among uninsured individuals, barriers to obtaining health insurance included cost and unemployment. Among those with insurance, 43% reported willingness to use insurance for STD services. Barriers to insurance use included concerns about anonymity and out-of-pocket costs. Despite expanded insurance access, many individuals presenting to the Rhode Island STD Clinic were uninsured. Among those who were insured, significant barriers still existed to using insurance. STD clinics continue to play an important role in providing safety-net STD services in states with low uninsured rates. Both public and private insurers are needed to address financial barriers and optimize payment structures for services.

28410389|t|Molecular subtyping of Treponema pallidum and associated factors of serofast status in early syphilis patients: Identified novel genotype and cytokine marker
28410389|a|Serofast, a persistent nontreponemal serological response observed in early syphilis patients after conventional treatment, remains a concern of clinicians and syphilis patients. No consensus has been established, however, that defines an effective treatment strategy and clarifies the pathogenesis. In this study, 517 patients with early syphilis were enrolled and treated. Twelve months after treatment, 79.3% (410/517) of patients achieved serological cure, 20.1% (104/517) were serofast, and 0.6% (3/517) were serological failures. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that older age (>40 years) and lower baseline RPR titer (≤ 1:8) were associated with serofast status. We also identified 21 T. pallidum molecular subtypes among early syphilis patients and detected a new subtype, 14i/a. We found that the proportion of 14i/a type in serofast patients was significantly higher than that in patients with serological cure, predicting an increasing risk of serofast status. Levels of chemerin were higher in the serum of serofast cases than serological cure cases, potentially indicating a novel cytokine marker for serofast in early syphilis patients after therapy. We hope that these results contribute to improve guidelines for the management of syphilis patients who experience serofast.

28411311|t|Total Fluorescence Fingerprinting of Pesticides: A Reliable Approach for Continuous Monitoring of Soils and Waters
28411311|a|The present work relates to the creation / extension of a database of Total Excitation-Emission and Total Synchronous Fluorescence Matrices (TEEMs and TSFMs) along with optimal Synchronous Fluorescence Spectra (SFS) to fingerprint pesticides widely used in Morocco. This spectrometric multi-component fingerprinting may permit the direct detection of pesticides persisting in soil or water. The objective of the current investigation is to detect four pesticide remains in agricultural soils by applying the spectrometric fingerprinting results. They are the commercial: i) insecticide Axlera 5G (carbamate), ii) fungicide Orsalis 5% SC (triazole), iii) insecticide Force 0,5 G (pyrethrinoid) and iv) insecticide Proclaim 05 SG (non-assigned). The agricultural plantations monitored are located in the great agricultural Doukkala region at the western Atlantic side of Morocco, where these chemicals are in large sale and use.

28412969|t|Engagement of cellular prion protein with the co-chaperone Hsp70 / 90 organizing protein regulates the proliferation of glioblastoma stem-like cells
28412969|a|Glioblastoma (GBM), a highly aggressive brain tumor, contains a subpopulation of glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) that play roles in tumor maintenance, invasion, and therapeutic resistance. GSCs are therefore a promising target for GBM treatment. Our group identified the cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) and its partner, the co-chaperone Hsp70 / 90 organizing protein (HOP), as potential target candidates due to their role in GBM tumorigenesis and in neural stem cell maintenance. GSCs expressing different levels of PrP(C) were cultured as neurospheres with growth factors, and characterized with stem cells markers and adhesion molecules markers through immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. We than evaluated GSC self-renewal and proliferation by clonal density assays and BrdU incorporation, respectively, in front of recombinant HOP treatment, combined or not with a HOP peptide which mimics the PrP(C) binding site. Stable silencing of HOP was also performed in parental and/or PrP(C) -depleted cell populations, and proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo were evaluated. Migration assays were performed on laminin-1 pre-coated glass. We observed that, when GBM cells are cultured as neurospheres, they express specific stemness markers such as CD133, CD15, Oct4, and SOX2; PrP(C) is upregulated compared to monolayer culture and co-localizes with CD133. PrP(C) silencing downregulates the expression of molecules associated with cancer stem cells, upregulates markers of cell differentiation and affects GSC self-renewal, pointing to a pivotal role for PrP(C) in the maintenance of GSCs. Exogenous HOP treatment increases proliferation and self-renewal of GSCs in a PrP(C) -dependent manner while HOP knockdown disturbs the proliferation process. In vivo, PrP(C) and/or HOP knockdown potently inhibits the growth of subcutaneously implanted glioblastoma cells. In addition, disruption of the PrP(C) - HOP complex by a HOP peptide, which mimics the PrP(C) binding site, affects GSC self-renewal and proliferation indicating that the HOP - PrP(C) complex is required for GSC stemness. Furthermore, PrP(C) -depleted GSCs downregulate cell adhesion-related proteins and impair cell migration indicating a putative role for PrP(C) in the cell surface stability of cell adhesion molecules and GBM cell invasiveness, respectively. In conclusion, our results show that the modulation of HOP - PrP(C) engagement or the decrease of PrP(C) and HOP expression may represent a potential therapeutic intervention in GBM, regulating glioblastoma stem-like cell self-renewal, proliferation, and migration.

28413179|t|Cyclic thrombocytopenia synchronizing with the menstrual cycle showing periodic phases of thrombocytopenia and rebound thrombocytosis
28413179|a|A 37- year -old woman was admitted to our hospital for purpura involving the extremities and thrombocytopenia. Prednisolone (PSL) was administered based on a diagnosis of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), but was not effective for maintaining her platelet count within the normal range, which showed cyclic fluctuation corresponding to the menstrual cycle. Therefore, we discontinued PSL, and cyclic thrombocytopenia (CTP) was diagnosed. CTP is a rare disease which is usually treated as ITP but with no response. Although the exact cause of CTP is uncertain, in our case, a hormonal mechanism may be responsible for fluctuating platelet count.

28413794|t|Comparative evaluation of iodine-131 metaiodobenzylguanidine and 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in assessing neural crest tumors: Will they play a complementary role?
28413794|a|18-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) has established a role in the evaluation of several malignancies. However, its precise clinical role in the neural crest cell tumors continues to evolve. The purpose of this study was to compare iodine-131 metaiodobenzylguanidine ((131)I-MIBG) and FDG-PET of head to head in patients with neural crest tumors both qualitatively and semiquantitatively and to determine their clinical utility in disease status evaluation and further management. A total of 32 patients who had undergone (131)I-MIBG and FDG-PET prospectively were evaluated and clinicopathologically grouped into three categories: neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma, and medullary carcinoma thyroid. In 18 patients of neuroblastoma, FDG PET and (131)I-MIBG showed patient-specific sensitivity of 84% and 72%, respectively. The mean maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of primary lesions in patients with unfavorable histology was found to be relatively higher than those with favorable histology (5.18 ± 2.38 vs. 3.21 ± 1.69). The mean SUVmax of two common sites (posterior superior iliac spine [PSIS] and greater trochanter) was higher in patients with involved marrow than those with uninvolved one (2.36 and 2.75 vs. 1.26 and 1.34, respectively). The ratio of SUVmax of the involved/ contralateral normal sites was 2.16 ± 1.9. In equivocal bone marrow results, the uptake pattern with SUV estimation can depict metastatic involvement and help in redirecting the biopsy site. Among seven patients of pheochromocytoma, FDG-PET revealed 100% patient-specific sensitivity. FDG-PET detected more metastatic foci than (131)I-MIBG (18 vs. 13 sites). In seven patients of medullary carcinoma thyroid, FDG-PET localized residual, recurrent, or metastatic disease with much higher sensitivity (32 metastatic foci with 72% patient specific sensitivity) than (131)I-MIBG, trending along the higher serum calcitonin levels. FDG-PET is not only a good complementary modality in the management of neural crest cell tumors but also it can even be superior, especially in cases of (131)I-MIBG nonavid tumors.

28416410|t|Progressive Occlusion and Recanalization after Endovascular Treatment for 287 Unruptured Small Aneurysms (<5mm): A Single-Center 6-Year Experience
28416410|a|We aimed to investigate the effect of coiling for small unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs)﹤5mm) on progressive occlusio n and recanalization, and the dubious factors related to progressive occlusion and recanalization among UIAs without complete occlusion. A total of 264 patients with 287 small UIAs were coiled in our institute between June 2009 and December 2014. All UIAs enrolled were divided into small (3-5mm) and very small (<3mm) group s, and UIAs without initial complete occlusion were divided into progressive, stable and recanalization groups. Baseline characteristics, procedure -related complications, angiographic follow-up results, and clinical outcomes were statistically analyzed. Among 287 aneurysms, 211 aneurysms (73.5%) were completely coiled, three (1.2%) intraoperative ruptures and 12 (4.2%) perioperative thromboembolic events occurred. Angiographic follow-up was available for 174 patients (65.9%), the incidence of recanalization was 5.7%. Among 56 aneurysms without complete occlusion, 43 (76.8%) had progressive occlusion and 6(10.7%) had recanalization. Anatomic results of initial and follow-up between small and very small groups were similar in both groups. On logistic regression analysis, smaller size (<3mm) without complete occlusion related to recanalization (OR, 8.0, 95% CI, 1.3-50.0, P=0.026). Our study suggested that coil embolization of small UIAs can achieve a high rate of progressive occlusion and low rate of recanalization during follow-up. Anatomic results of initial and follow-up between small (3-5mm) and very small (<3mm) groups were similar in both groups. What's more, smaller size (<3mm) without complete occlusion may relate to recanalization.

28417422|t|Selection of an Artificial Diet for Laboratory Rearing of Opogona sacchari (Lepidoptera: Tineidae) (Bojer, 1856)
28417422|a|The banana moth Opogona sacchari (Bojer) (Lepidoptera: Tineidae) is a polyphagous pest that can cause serious damage, in particular to banana crops in southern Brazil. The insect is a quarantine pest in several countries, including Argentina, the main consumer market for bananas from southern Brazil. Little information is available about the biology and ecology of this moth, such as a suitable diet for laboratory rearing. In order to provide support for integrated pest management of the pest, this study furnished data for selecting two diets suitable for continuous laboratory rearing of O. sacchari, one based on dried beans, wheat germ, soy bran, brewer's yeast, and casein and another diet with wheat germ and casein as protein sources. With both diets, the viability of the egg - adult period exceeded 68%, with fertility over 338 eggs per female. A corrected biotic potential analysis gave similar values for the two diets.

28420538|t|The impact on productivity of a hypothetical tax on sugar-sweetened beverages
28420538|a|To quantify the potential impact of an additional 20% tax on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) on productivity in Australia. We used a multi-state lifetable Markov model to examine the potential impact of an additional 20% tax on SSBs on total lifetime productivity in the paid and unpaid sectors of the economy. The study population consisted of Australians aged 20 years or older in 2010, whose health and other relevant outcomes were modelled over their remaining lifetime. The SSBs tax was estimated to reduce the number of people with obesity by 1.96% of the entire population (437,000 fewer persons with obesity), and reduce the number of employees with obesity by 317,000 persons. These effects translated into productivity gains in the paid sector of AU$751 million for the working - age population (95% confidence interval: AU$565 million to AU$954 million), using the human capital approach. In the unpaid sector, the potential productivity gains amounted to AU$1172 million (AU$929 million to AU$1435 million) using the replacement cost method. These productivity benefits are in addition to the health benefits of 35,000 life years gained and a reduction in healthcare costs of AU$425 million. An additional 20% tax on SSBs not only improves health outcomes and reduces healthcare costs, but provides productivity gains in both the paid and unpaid sectors of the economy.

28421026|t|Keeping the Spirits Up: The Effect of Teachers' and Parents' Emotional Support on Children's Working Memory Performance
28421026|a|Working memory, used to temporarily store and mentally manipulate information, is important for children's learning. It is therefore valuable to understand which (contextual) factors promote or hinder working memory performance. Recent research shows positive associations between positive parent-child and teacher-student interactions and working memory performance and development. However, no study has yet experimentally investigated how parents and teachers affect working memory performance. Based on attachment theory, the current study investigated the role of parent and teacher emotional support in promoting working memory performance by buffering the negative effect of social stress. Questionnaires and an experimental session were completed by 170 children from grade 1 to 2 (Mage = 7 years 6 months, SD = 7 months). Questionnaires were used to assess children's perceptions of the teacher-student and parent-child relationship. During an experimental session, working memory was measured with the Corsi task backward (Milner, 1971) in a pre- and post-test design. In-between the tests stress was induced in the children using the Cyberball paradigm (Williams et al., 2000). Emotional support was manipulated (between-subjects) through an audio message (either a weather report, a supportive message of a stranger, a supportive message of a parent, or a supportive message of a teacher). Results of repeated measures ANOVA showed no clear effect of the stress induction. Nevertheless, an effect of parent and teacher support was found and depended on the quality of the parent-child relationship. When children had a positive relationship with their parent, support of parents and teachers had little effect on working memory performance. When children had a negative relationship with their parent, a supportive message of that parent decreased working memory performance, while a supportive message from the teacher increased performance. In sum, the current study suggests that parents and teachers can support working memory performance by being supportive for the child. Teacher support is most effective when the child has a negative relationship with the parent. These insights can give direction to specific measures aimed at preventing and resolving working memory problems and related issues.

28424445|t|Management of tachyarrhythmia during pregnancy
28424445|a|Maternal tachyarrhythmia is a common complication during pregnancy due to hormonal changes that enhance pre-existing arrhythmias or induce new arrhythmias in the presence of congenital heart defects in pregnant females. Presence of tachyarrhythmia during pregnancy poses risk to the mother and fetus, calling for proper treatment with medications. Use of antiarrhythmic drugs in cases of maternal tachyarrhythmia must give due consideration of potential teratogenic side effects. Utilization of antiarrhythmic drugs during pregnancy has been well studied; some result in minimal fetal harm or none at all. New techniques, such as cardiac ablation, have also been implemented with minimal or no radiation exposure to the fetus or mother. Pregnant women with tachyarrhythmia have been successfully treated with little to no impact on the developing fetus as result of increasing experience with antiarrhythmic drugs and progress of new procedural techniques.

28424584|t|Hif-1α Overexpression Improves Transplanted Bone Mesenchymal Stem Cells Survival in Rat MCAO Stroke Model
28424584|a|Bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) death after transplantation is a serious obstacle impacting on the outcome of cell therapy for cerebral infarction. This study was aimed to investigate whether modification of BMSCs with hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (Hif-1α) could enhance the survival of the implanted BMSCs. BMSCs were isolated from Wistar rats, and were infected with Hif-1α-GFP lentiviral vector or Hif-1α siRNA. The modified BMSCs were exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) condition, cellular viability and apoptosis were then assessed. An inhibitor of AMPK (compound C) was used to detect whether AMPK and mTOR were implicated in the functions of Hif-1α on BMSCs survival. Besides, ultrastructure of BMSCs was observed and the expression of autophagy markers was measured. The modified BMSCs were transplanted into middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of rats, and the cerebral infarction volume and neurological function was assessed. The results indicated that Hif-1α overexpression protected OGD induced injury by promoting cellular viability and inhibiting apoptosis. AMPK was activated while mTOR was inactivated by Hif-1α overexpression, and that might be through which Hif-1α functioned BMSCs survival. Hif-1α overexpression promoted autophagy; more important, compound C abolished the induction of Hif-1α on autophagy. Transplantation of the overexpressed Hif-1α of BMSCs into the MCAO rats reduced brain infarct volume and improved neurobehavioral outcome; besides, it inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokines generation while promoted neurotrophin secretion. In conclusion, Hif-1α might be contributed in the survival of BMSCs by regulating the activation of AMPK and mTOR, as well as by promoting autophagy.

28425183|t|Associations between major life events and adherence, glycemic control, and psychosocial characteristics in teens with type 1 diabetes
28425183|a|This cross-sectional study assessed the type of major life events occurring in a contemporary sample of teens with type 1 diabetes and the association between event frequency and demographic, diabetes management, and psychosocial characteristics. Parents of 178 teens completed the Life Events Checklist to report major events teens had experienced in the last year: 42% experienced 0 to 1 event (n = 75), 32% experienced 2 to 3 events (n = 57), and 26% experienced 4+ events (n = 46). Teens and parents completed validated measures of treatment adherence, diabetes -specific self-efficacy, quality of life, and diabetes -specific family conflict. Parent-youth interview and chart review provided demographics and diabetes management data. Mean number of events / teen was 2.6 ± 2.7 (range = 0-15). The most common events were " Hospitalization of a family member " (24%), " Getting a bad report card " (20%), "Serious arguments between parents " (19%), and " Serious illness / injury in a family member " (19%). Compared with teens experiencing 0 to 1 event, teens experiencing 4+ events were less likely to have married parents (P = .01) and a parent with a college degree (P = .006). Teen s with 4+ events had significantly poorer adherence (P = .002 teen, P = .02 parent), lower self-efficacy (P = .03 teen, P < .0001 parent), poorer quality of life (P < .0001 teen, P < .0001 parent), and more conflict (P = .006 teen, P = .02 parent) than teens with fewer events. In a multivariate model (R (2) = 0.21, P < .0001) controlling for demographic and diabetes management characteristics, fewer events was associated with lower A1c (P = .0009). Occurrence of more major life events was associated with poorer diabetes care and A1c and more negative psychosocial qualities in teens with type 1 diabetes.

28427537|t|Metabolomics, Nutrition, and Potential Biomarkers of Food Quality, Intake, and Health Status
28427537|a|Diet, dietary patterns, and other environmental factors such as exposure to toxins are playing an important role in the prevention / development of many diseases, like obesity, type 2 diabetes, and consequently on the health status of individuals. A major challenge nowadays is to identify novel biomarkers to detect as early as possible metabolic dysfunction and to predict evolution of health status in order to refine nutritional advices to specific population groups. Omics technologies such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics coupled with statistical and bioinformatics tools have already shown great potential in this research field even if so far only few biomarkers have been validated. For the past two decades, important analytical techniques have been developed to detect as many metabolites as possible in human biofluids such as urine, blood, and saliva. In the field of food science and nutrition, many studies have been carried out for food authenticity, quality, and safety, as well as for food processing. Furthermore, metabolomic investigations have been carried out to discover new early biomarkers of metabolic dysfunction and predictive biomarkers of developing pathologies (obesity, metabolic syndrome, type-2 diabetes, etc.). Great emphasis is also placed in the development of methodologies to identify and validate biomarkers of nutrients exposure.

28429154|t|Developing elite Neurospora crassa strains for cellulosic ethanol production using fungal breeding
28429154|a|The demand for renewable and sustainable energy has generated considerable interest in the conversion of cellulosic biomass into liquid fuels such as ethanol using a filamentous fungus. While attempts have been made to study cellulose metabolism through the use of knock-out mutants, there have been no systematic effort to characterize natural variation for cellulose metabolism in ecotypes adapted to different habitats. Here, we characterized natural variation in saccharification of cellulose and fermentation in 73 ecotypes and 89 laboratory strains of the model fungus Neurospora crassa. We observed significant variation in both traits among natural and laboratory generated populations, with some elite strains performing better than the reference strain. In the F1 population N345, 15% of the population outperformed both parents with the top performing strain having 10% improvement in ethanol production. These results suggest that natural alleles can be exploited through fungal breeding for developing elite industrial strains for bioethanol production.

28429354|t|The role of the hippocampus and the function of calcitonin gene-related peptide in the mechanism of traumatic brain injury accelerating fracture-healing
28429354|a|This research attempts to identify the part the hippocampus plays in accelerated fracture-healing after traumatic brain injury as well as to test functions of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) during this process. Experiments were carried out on Male Sprague-Dawley rats that were split into four groups at random: TBI - fracture group, fracture - only group, TBI - only group, and control group. In the first week, blood specimen would be drawn from rats among the groups except those of the control group at three-time points (24, 72 and 168 hours) post - damage. These rats would be assessed from the neurological perspective based on their grades of performance in a sequence of tests 24 hours before and 12 hours after brain injury. Blood samples were also taken from the control group 24 hours before the injury, and whole brain tissues in the injured groups were harvested at 72 and 168 hours post - injury. We compared the serum CGRP concentration, the distribution of CGRP, the CGRP expression, and the expression of CGRP in the hippocampus, the expression of CGRP in the hippocampus, the expression of CGRP in the hippocampus, and the expression of CGRP in the brain by immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, RT - Of CGRP RNA expression levels. Neurological examinations suggested that the functions of the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and brain stem showed significant differences pre - and post - injury (p < 0.001). ELISA analysis indicated a great density of CGRP in TBI - fracture group at different time points. Furthermore, in the TBI - fracture group, CGRP in both hippocampus and the whole brain showed a noticeable augment in RT-PCR and western blot analysis at 72 and 168 h post - injury, and only in this group, immunohistochemistry analysis indicated that CGRP was present in the hippocampus at 168 hours post - injury. We observed that the hippocampus and CGRP were responsible for quick bone-healing mechanisms. We suggest a role for the hippocampus in accelerated fracture healing. CGRP expression, as determined by IHC, cannot be observed in other groups, indicating that the hippocampus may be the specific component of the brain that responds to " big stress ".

28429412|t|Bone extracellular matrix hydrogel enhances osteogenic differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts and mouse primary calvarial cells
28429412|a|Hydrogel scaffolds derived from the extracellular matrix (ECM) of mammalian tissues have been successfully used to promote tissue repair in vitro and in vivo. The objective of this study was to evaluate the osteogenic potential of ECM hydrogels prepared from demineralized and decellularized bovine bone in the presence and absence of osteogenic medium. Culture of C2C12 and mouse primary calvarial cells (mPCs) on decellularized bone ECM (bECM) and demineralized bone matrix (DBM) gels resulted in increased expression of osteogenic gene markers, including a 3.6- and 13.4-fold increase in osteopontin and 15.7- and 27.1-fold increase in osteocalcin when mPCs were cultured upon bECM with basal and osteogenic media, respectively. bECM hydrogels stimulated the osteogenic differentiation of C2C12 and mPCs even in the absence of osteogenic medium. These results suggest that bECM hydrogel scaffolds may have great utility in future clinical applications for bone tissue engineering. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

28430341|t|Prostate-specific antigen increase during dutasteride to indicate the need for prostate biopsy: influence of prostatic inflammation
28430341|a|The aim of this study was to analyze the significance of an increase in total prostate-specific antigen (PSA) serum levels despite dutasteride treatment as a predictor of prostate cancer (PC) at biopsy. We focused our attention on the rate of the first PSA increase and on the influence of prostatic inflammation. From 2011 to 2016, 365 men with a previous negative prostate biopsy and persistent elevated PSA levels received dutasteride treatment. The population was followed for a range of 12-48 months. One hundred twelve cases with a confirmed PSA increase >0.5 ng/ml over the nadir value during the follow-up were included in Group A and underwent a new prostate biopsy. In Group A, the PSA increase was associated with PC at the re-biopsy in 66% of cases. The percentage of PSA reduction after 6 months of treatment was not a significant indicator of the risk for PC. The distribution of inflammatory infiltrates significantly (p<00.01) varied from positive to negative prostate biopsies. The relative risk for PC at biopsy significantly increase d according to PSA level during dutasteride. Treatment with dutasteride can help to analyze PSA kinetic. A persistent prostatic inflammation is a factor able to reduce the performance of PSA kinetic during dutasteride treatment.

28433844|t|Neurological Decline in an Elderly with Repaired Myelomeningocele Complicated with Lumbar Canal Stenosis: a case report
28433844|a|Tethered cord syndrome is a well-known complication after myelomeningocele (MMC) repair in childhood. However, late complications in adults with a repaired MMC are not well understood. In particular, the influence of a degenerative spinal deformity on a sustained tethered cord is still unclear. A 63-year-old man with a repaired MMC presented with a progressive gait disturbance and numbness in both lower limbs. Magnetic resonance images demonstrated that the tethered spinal cord was compressed by severe canal stenosis along the entire lumbar spine. After a multi-level lumbar decompression surgery, the patient recovered to baseline neurological status. In adults with a repaired MMC, lumbar canal stenosis should be investigated as a possible cause of late neurological decline. Clinical manifestations may be complicated by the coexistence of both the original and subsequent neurological disorders. Because these additional disorders result from compressive myelopathy, early surgical decompression is indicated to avoid irreversible spinal cord dysfunction.

28434980|t|Thaw -and-use target cells pre-labeled with calcein AM for antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity assays
28434980|a|In vitro antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) assays are routinely performed to support the research and development of therapeutic antibodies. In ADCC assays, target cells bound by the antibodies are lysed by activated effector cells following interactions between the Fc region of the bound antibody and Fcγ receptors on effector cells. Target cell lysis is typically measured by quantification of released endogenous enzymes, e.g., lactate dehydrogenase, or measurement of released exogenous labels, e.g., (51)Cr, europium or calcein. ADCC assays based on the detection of exogenous labels released from lysed target cells generally show higher sensitivity and require shorter incubation times. However, target cells are usually labeled immediately prior to assay, which inadvertently introduces additional assay variations due to differences in target cell conditions and labeling / handling processes. In this report, we describe the use of thaw -and-use pre-labeled target cells for ADCC assays. Thaw -and-use target cells in our experiments were pre-labeled with the fluorescent dye calcein AM, cryopreserved in single-use aliquots and used directly in assays after thawing. Upon thaw, the pre-labeled cells displayed viability and label retention comparable to freshly labeled cells, responded to ADCC mediated by both peripheral blood mononuclear cells and engineered natural killer cells, performed stably for at least 3 years and provided favorable precision and accuracy to ADCC assays. Implementation of thaw -and-use pre-labeled target cells in ADCC assays can help to alleviate both cell culture and dye labeling derived variability, increase the flexibility of assay scheduling and improve assay consistency and robustness.

28436433|t|Pathways and Genes Associated with Immune Dysfunction in Sheep Paratuberculosis
28436433|a|Multibacillary and paucibacillary paratuberculosis are both caused by Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis. Multibacillary lesions are composed largely of infected epithelioid macrophages and paucibacillary lesions contain T cells but few bacteria. Multibacillary disease is similar to human lepromatous leprosy, with variable/high levels of antibody and a dysfunctional immune response. Animals with paucibacillary disease have high cell-mediated immunity and variable levels of antibody. This study aims to characterize the immunological dysfunction using TruSeq analysis of the ileocaecal lymph node that drains disease lesions. Immune dysfunction is highlighted by repression of TCR / CD3 genes, T cell co-receptors / co-stimulators, T cell activation and signal-transduction genes. Inflammation was an acute phase response and chronic inflammation, with little evidence of acute inflammation. The high levels of immunoglobulin and plasma cell transcripts is consistent with the anti-MAP antibody responses in paratuberculosis sheep. Also notable was the overwhelming reduction in mast cell transcripts, potentially affecting DC activation of the immune response. This study also shows that there were no fundamental differences in the gene expression patterns in multibacillary and paucibacillary disease, no shift in T cell genes from Th1 to Th2 pattern but rather an incremental decline into immune dysfunction leading to multibacillary pathology.

28437582|t|Modified frailty index predicts postoperative outcomes in older gastrointestinal cancer patients
28437582|a|Frailty disproportionately impacts older patients with gastrointestinal cancer, rendering them at increased risk for poor outcomes. A frailty index may aid in preoperative risk stratification. We hypothesized that high modified frailty index (mFI) scores are associated with adverse outcomes after tumor resection in older, gastrointestinal cancer patients. Patients (60-90 years old) who underwent gastrointestinal tumor resection were identified in the 2005-2012 NSQIP Participant Use File. mFI was defined by 11 previously described, preoperative variables. Frailty was defined by an mFI score >0.27. The postoperative course was evaluated using univariate and multivariate analysis. 41 455 patients (mean age 72.4 years, 47.4% female) were identified. The most prevalent form of cancer was colorectal (69.3%, n = 28 708) and 2.8% of patients were frail (n = 1,164). Frail patients were significantly more likely to have increased length of stay (11.7 vs 9.0 days), major complications (29.1% vs 17.9%), and 30-day mortality (5.6% vs 2.5%), (all P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis identified mFI as an independent predictor of major complications (OR 1.52, 95%CI 1.39-1.65, P < 0.001) and 30-day mortality (OR 1.48, 95%CI 1.24-1.75, P < 0.001). mFI was associated with the incidence of postoperative complications and mortality in older surgical patients with gastrointestinal cancer.

28443376|t|Remote Ischemic Conditioning and Renal Protection
28443376|a|Over the course of the last 2 decades, the concept of remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) has attracted considerable research interest, because RIC, in most of its embodiments offers an inexpensive way of protecting tissues against ischemic damage inflicted by a number of medical conditions or procedures. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common side effect in the context of various medical procedures, and RIC has been suggested as a means of reducing its incidence. Outcomes regarding kidney function have been reported in numerous studies that evaluated the effects of RIC in a variety of settings (eg, cardiac surgery, interventions requiring intravenous administration of contrast media). Although several individual studies have implied a beneficial effect of RIC in preserving kidney function, 3 recently published randomized controlled trials evaluating more than 1000 patients each (Effect of Remote Ischemic Preconditioning in the Cardiac Surgery, Remote Ischaemic Preconditioning for Heart Surgery, and E RIC CA) were negative. However, AKI or any other index of renal function was not a stand-alone primary end point in any of these trials. On the other hand, a range of meta-analyses (each including thousands of participants) have reported mixed results, with the most recent among them showing benefit from RIC, pinpointing at the same time a number of shortcomings in published studies, adversely affecting the quality of available data. The present review provides a critical appraisal of the current state of this field of research. It is the opinion of the authors of this review that there is a clear need for a common clinical trial framework for ischemic conditioning studies. If the current babel of definitions, procedures, outcomes, and goals persists, it is most likely that soon ischemic conditioning will be "yesterday's news" with no definitive conclusions having been reached in terms of its real clinical utility.

28446912|t|Temporal and Spatial Variability of Fungal Structures and Host Responses in an Incompatible Rust-Wheat Interaction
28446912|a|Information about temporal and spatial variability of fungal structures and host responses is scarce in comparison to the vast amount of genetic, biochemical, and physiological studies of host-pathogen interactions. In this study, we used avirulent wild type and virulent mutant isolates of Puccinia striiformis to characterize the interactions in wheat carrying yellow rust Yr2 resistance. Both conventional and advanced microscopic techniques were used for a detailed study of morphology and growth of fungal colonies and associated host cell responses. The growth of the wild type isolates was highly restricted due to hypersensitive response (HR, plant cell death) indicated by autofluorescence and change in the shape of the affected plant cells. The host response appeared post - haustorial, but large variation in the time and stage of arrest was observed for individual fungal colonies, probably due to a delay between detection and response. Some colonies were stopped right after the formation of the primary infection hyphae whereas others formed highly branched mycelia. HR was first observed in host cells in direct contact with fungal structures, after which the defense responses spread to adjacent host cells, and eventually led to encasement of the fungal colony. Several cells with HR contained haustoria, which were small and underdeveloped, but some cells contained normal sized haustoria without signs of hypersensitivity. The growth of the virulent mutants in the resistant plants was similar to the growth in plants without Yr2 resistance, which is a strong indication that the incompatible phenotype was associated with Yr2. The interaction between P. striiformis and wheat with Yr2 resistance was highly variable in time and space, which demonstrate that histological studies are important for a deeper understanding of host-pathogen interactions and plant defense mechanisms in general.

28447924|t|The Effects of Messages about the Causes of Obesity on Disciplinary Action Decisions for Overweight Employees
28447924|a|We investigated the impact of messages about the causes of obesity (controllable or uncontrollable) on the disciplinary action consequences selected for obese employees in response to a work-related mistake. Participants read about either the controllable or uncontrollable causes of obesity before reviewing an ostensible employee file that included a description of an employee mistake. Depending on condition, the file contained a photo of the employee that either depicted them as obese or average weight. Participants were more willing to withhold a raise or promotion from an obese employee than from an average - weight employee. Further, there was little evidence that the messages about the causes of obesity affected participants ' perceived control and self-efficacy for healthy behaviors.

28447984|t|Experience is Instrumental in Tuning a Link Between Language and Cognition: Evidence from 6- to 7- Month-Old Infants ' Object Categorization
28447984|a|At birth, infants not only prefer listening to human vocalizations, but also have begun to link these vocalizations to cognition: For infants as young as three months of age, listening to human language supports object categorization, a core cognitive capacity. This precocious link is initially broad: At 3 and 4 months, vocalizations of both humans and nonhuman primates support categorization. But by 6 months, infants have narrowed the link: Only human vocalizations support object categorization. Here we ask what guides infants as they tune their initially broad link to a more precise one, engaged only by the vocalizations of our species. Across three studies, we use a novel exposure paradigm to examine the effects of experience. We document that merely exposing infants to nonhuman primate vocalizations enables infants to preserve the early - established link between this signal and categorization. In contrast, exposing infants to backward speech - a signal that fails to support categorization at any age - offers no such advantage. Our findings reveal the power of early experience as infants specify which signals, from an initially broad set, they will continue to link to cognition.

28448089|t|Bone Degeneration and Its Recovery in SMP30/GNL - Knockout Mice
28448089|a|Senescence marker protein-30 (SMP30) decreases androgen -independently with aging and is a lactone - hydrolyzing enzyme gluconolactonase (GNL) that is involved in vitamin C biosynthesis. In the present study, bone properties of SMP30/GNL knockout (KO) mice with deficiency in vitamin C synthesis were investigated to reveal the effects of SMP30/GNL and exogenous vitamin C supplementation on bone formation. Mineral content (BMC) and mineral density (BMD) of the mandible and femur of SMP30/GNL KO and wild-type mice at 2 and 3 months of age with or without vitamin C supplementation were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Body and bone weight of both age groups decreased and became significantly lower than those of wild-type mice. The bones of SMP30/GNL KO mice were rough and porous, with BMC and BMD significantly below wild-type. Oral supplementation with vitamin C eliminated differences in body weight, bone weight, BMC, and BMD between SMP30/GNL KO and wild-type mice at each age. These results indicate that bone degeneration in SMP30/GNL KO mice was caused by lack of vitamin C, and that this mouse strain is an appropriate model for bone metabolism in humans, which have no ability to synthesize vitamin C.

28449774|t|Utility of Post-Mortem Genetic Testing in Cases of Sudden Arrhythmic Death Syndrome
28449774|a|Sudden arrhythmic death syndrome (SADS) describes a sudden death with negative autopsy and toxicological analysis. Cardiac genetic disease is a likely etiology. This study investigated the clinical utility and combined yield of post-mortem genetic testing (molecular autopsy) in cases of SADS and comprehensive clinical evaluation of surviving relatives. We evaluated 302 expertly validated SADS cases with suitable DNA (median age: 24 years; 65% males) who underwent next-generation sequencing using an extended panel of 77 primary electrical disorder and cardiomyopathy genes. Pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants were classified using American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) consensus guidelines. The yield of combined molecular autopsy and clinical evaluation in 82 surviving families was evaluated. A gene-level rare variant association analysis was conducted in SADS cases versus controls. A clinically actionable pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant was identified in 40 of 302 cases (13%). The main etiologies established were catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and long QT syndrome (17 [6%] and 11 [4%], respectively). Gene-based rare variants association analysis showed enrichment of rare predicted deleterious variants in RYR2 (p = 5 × 10(-5)). Combining molecular autopsy with clinical evaluation in surviving families increased diagnostic yield from 26% to 39%. Molecular autopsy for electrical disorder and cardiomyopathy genes, using ACMG guidelines for variant classification, identified a modest but realistic yield in SADS. Our data highlighted the predominant role of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and long QT syndrome, especially the RYR2 gene, as well as the minimal yield from other genes. Furthermore, we showed the enhanced utility of combined clinical and genetic evaluation.

28450395|t|Binding of DEAD-box helicase Dhh1 to the 5'UTR of ASH1 mRNA represses localized translation of ASH1 in yeast cells
28450395|a|Local translation of specific mRNAs is regulated by dynamic changes in their subcellular localization, and these changes are due to complex mechanisms controlling cytoplasmic mRNA transport. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is well suited to studying these mechanisms because many of its transcripts are transported from the mother cell to the budding daughter cell. Here, we investigated the translational control of ASH1 mRNA after transport and localization. We show that although ASH1 transcripts were translated after they reached the bud-tip, some mRNAs were bound by the RNA-binding protein Puf6 and were non-polysomal. We also found that the DEAD-box helicase Dhh1 complexed with the untranslated ASH1 mRNA and Puf6. Loss of Dhh1 affected local translation of ASH1 mRNA and resulted in delocalization of ASH1 transcript in the bud. Forcibly shifting the non-polysomal ASH1 mRNA into polysomes was associated with Dhh1 dissociation. We further demonstrated that Dhh1 is not recruited to ASH1 mRNA co-transcriptionally, suggesting that it could bind to ASH1 mRNA within the cytoplasm. Of note, Dhh1 bound to the 5 UTR of ASH1 mRNA and inhibited its translation in vitro. These results suggest that after localization to the bud tip, a portion of the localized ASH1 mRNA becomes translationally inactive, because of binding of Dhh1 and Puf6 to the 5' and 3' UTRs of ASH1 mRNA.

28450855|t|The Abundance of Endofungal Bacterium Rhizobium radiobacter (syn. Agrobacterium tumefaciens) Increases in Its Fungal Host Piriformospora indica during the Tripartite Sebacinalean Symbiosis with Higher Plants
28450855|a|Rhizobium radiobacter (syn. Agrobacterium tumefaciens, syn. " Agrobacterium fabrum ") is an endofungal bacterium of the fungal mutualist Piriformospora (syn. Serendipita) indica (Basidiomycota), which together form a tripartite Sebacinalean symbiosis with a broad range of plants. R. radiobacter strain F4 (RrF4), isolated from P. indica DSM 11827, induces growth promotion and systemic resistance in cereal crops, including barley and wheat, suggesting that R. radiobacter contributes to a successful symbiosis. Here, we studied the impact of endobacteria on the morphology and the beneficial activity of P. indica during interactions with plants. Low numbers of endobacteria were detected in the axenically grown P. indica (long term lab-cultured, lcPiri) whereas mycelia colonizing the plant root contained increased numbers of bacteria. Higher numbers of endobacteria were also found in axenic cultures of P. indica that was freshly re-isolated (riPiri) from plant roots, though numbers dropped during repeated axenic re-cultivation. Prolonged treatments of P. indica cultures with various antibiotics could not completely eliminate the bacterium, though the number of detectable endobacteria decreased significantly, resulting in partial-cured P. indica (pcPiri). pcPiri showed reduced growth in axenic cultures and poor sporulation. Consistent with this, pcPiri also showed reduced plant growth promotion and reduced systemic resistanc e against powdery mildew infection as compared with riPiri and lcPiri. These results are consistent with the assumption that the endobacterium R. radiobacter improves P. indica's fitness and thus contributes to the success of the tripartite Sebacinalean symbiosis.

28451446|t|Stem cell registry programme for patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting: what benefits does it derive?
28451446|a|Standardization of stem cell therapy requires application of appropriate methods to evaluate safety and efficac y, including long-term pharmacovigilance. To accomplish this objective, a long-term registry programme was installed. We analysed 150 patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, who received intramyocardial CD133+ bone marrow mononuclear stem cell treatment combined with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or CABG alone. The mortality rate, major adverse cerebral and cardiac events, and functional outcome parameters were evaluated for the time period up to 14 years follow-up. As a result, we have stratified the patient population (96 patients) into responders and non-responders. Furthermore, the analysis of relevant predictors of good response to CD133+ bone marrow mononuclear stem cell treatment was performed. Several positive tendencies related to stem cells transplantation were demonstrated. First, no significant difference in major adverse cardiovascular and cerebral events was observed between stem cell and control group up to 14 years follow-up. Second, an improvement of left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) in stem cell group retained for 5 years in contrast with CABG - only group, where no significant changes in LVEF after 2 years were observed. In addition, LVEF under 30% and left ventricle end diastolic diameter above 60 mm were independent predictors of functional response to CD133+ cell therapy. Participants with overt heart failure benefit most from CABG combined with intramyocardial injection of CD133+ bone marrow mononuclear cell within the group. An improvement LVEF in stem cell group remained for 5 years in contrast with the CABG - only group. The patients, in whom the improvement of both LVEF and LVED was observed, have benefited by increased life expectancy.

28454482|t|Effects of Environmental Factors and Metallic Electrodes on AC Electrical Conduction Through DNA Molecule
28454482|a|Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is one of the best candidate materials for various device applications such as in electrodes for rechargeable batteries, biosensors, molecular electronics, medical - and biomedical - applications etc. Hence, it is worthwhile to examine the mechanism of charge transport in the DNA molecule, however, still a question without a clear answer is DNA a molecular conducting material (wire), semiconductor, or insulator? The answer, after the published data, is still ambiguous without any confirmed and clear scientific answer. DNA is found to be always surrounded with different electric charges, ions, and dipoles. These surrounding charges and electric barrier(s) due to metallic electrodes (as environmental factors (EFs)) play a substantial role when measuring the electrical conductivity through λ-double helix (DNA) molecule suspended between metallic electrodes. We found that strong frequency dependence of AC - complex conductivity comes from the electrical conduction of EFs. This leads to superimposing serious incorrect experimental data to measured ones. At 1 MHz, we carried out a first control experiment on electrical conductivity with and without the presence of DNA molecule. If there are possible electrical conduction due to stray ions and contribution of substrate, we will detected them. This control experiment revealed that there is an important role played by the environmental - charges around DNA molecule and any experiment should consider this role. We have succeeded to measure both electrical conductivity due to EFs (σ ENV) and electrical conductivity due to DNA molecule (σ DNA) independently by carrying the measurements at different DNA - lengths and subtracting the data. We carried out measurements as a function of frequency (f) and temperature (T) in the ranges 0.1 Hz < f < 1 MHz and 288 K < T < 343 K. The measured conductivity (σ MES) portrays a metal -like behavior at high frequencies near 1 MHz. However, we found that σ DNA was far from this behavior because the conduction due to EFs superimposes σ DNA, in particular at low frequencies. By measuring the electrical conductivity at different lengths: 40, 60, 80, and 100 nm, we have succeeded not only to separate the electrical conduction of the DNA molecule from all EFs effects that surround the molecule, but also to present accurate values of σ DNA and the dielectric constant of the molecule ε'DNA as a function of temperature and frequency. Furthermore, in order to explain these data, we present a model describing the electrical conduction through DNA molecule: DNA is a classical semiconductor with charges, dipoles and ions that result in creation of localized energy - states (LESs) in the extended bands and in the energy gap of the DNA molecule. This model explains clearly the mechanism of charge transfer mechanism in the DNA, and it sheds light on why the charge transfer through the DNA can lead to insulating, semiconducting, or metallic behavior on the same time. The model considers charges on DNA, in the extended bands, either could be free to move under electric field or localized in potential wells/hills. Localization of charges in DNA is an intrinsic structural - property of this solitaire molecule. At all temperatures, the expected increase in thermal - induced charge is attributed to the delocalization of holes (or/and electrons) in potential hills (or/and potential wells) which accurately accounts for the total electric and dielectric behavior through DNA molecule. We succeeded to fit the experiment al data to the proposed model with reasonable magnitudes of potential hills/wells that are in the energy range from 0.068 eV.

28456987|t|Next-Generation Sequencing Approaches to Define the Role of the Autophagy Lysosomal Pathway in Human Disease: The Example of LysoPlex
28456987|a|Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies have deeply changed the throughput of genetic testing allowing analyzing millions of DNA fragments in parallel. One key application is the understanding of genetically heterogeneous and complex diseases where 50-100 different genes may converge to control the same pathways. These disorders cannot be studied using traditional approaches, based on gene-by-gene Sanger sequencing. We have set up an NGS protocol based on a specific selection of DNA regions belonging to about 900 genes of the autophagy-lysosomal (ALP) pathway. We here specify all the technical steps and challenges of our protocol, named LysoPlex. This is based on the Haloplex technology and together with high-coverage sequencing empowers a high and uniform coverage of ALP genes. LysoPlex outplays other NGS applications in sensitivity and specificity, providing an accurate picture of all variations in ALP genes.

28457143|t|Typical Skin Injuries in Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder
28457143|a|Pediatric skin injuries have primarily been described in typically developing children. Our objectives were to describe the prevalence and pattern of skin injuries of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), to describe how this compared with previously demonstrated skin injury locations in typically developing children, and to identify differences in skin injury frequency and locations between autistic children with and without self-injurious behaviors (SIBs). Children with ASD were recruited between September of 2011 and September of 2014. Demographic information was obtained from the caregiver. All skin injuries and their locations were documented. Of the 41 children enrolled, half were reported to have SIBs. The most identified skin injury locations were the legs, knees, and back. Children with autism (1) obtain skin injuries frequently and in similar locations as typically developing children and (2) rarely obtain skin injuries to locations that are considered uncommon for accidental injuries despite reports of SIBs.

28459420|t|Is Total Elbow Arthroplasty Safe as an Outpatient Procedure?
28459420|a|Ambulatory surgery centers are the preferred setting for many procedures formerly performed in a hospital setting. This study sought to determine whether outpatient total elbow arthroplasty (TEA) is as safe as inpatient TEA. A retrospective analysis was performed of inpatient (IP) versus outpatient (OP) TEA by a single surgeon over a period of 18 years. Demographic, social, and comorbidity measures as well as complication rates were analyzed and stratified by IP or OP status. Bivariate comparison showed increased prevalence of coronary artery disease in the OP group (32% vs. 7%) and increased age in the IP group (68 years vs. 58 years). All other demographic, social, and comorbidity factors were comparable between the IP and OP groups, although more infections were seen in the IP group. The surgeons' initial learning curve occurred mostly within the IP group. Most important, no difference in complication rate was observed between the IP and OP groups.

28459654|t|Developmental Hypoxia Has Negligible Effects on Long-Term Hypoxia Tolerance and Aerobic Metabolism of Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar)
28459654|a|Exposure to developmental hypoxia can have long-term impacts on the physiological performance of fish because of irreversible plasticity. Wild and captive-reared Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) can be exposed to hypoxic conditions during development and continue to experience fluctuating oxygen levels as juveniles and adults. Here, we examine whether developmental hypoxia impacts subsequent hypoxia tolerance and aerobic performance of Atlantic salmon. Individuals at 8°C were exposed to 50% (hypoxia) or 100% (normoxia) dissolved oxygen (DO) saturation (as percent of air saturation) from fertilization for ∼100 d (800 degree days) and then raised in normoxic conditions for a further 15 mo. At 18 mo after fertilization, aerobic scope was calculated in normoxia (100% DO) and acute (18 h) hypoxia (50% DO) from the difference between the minimum and maximum oxygen consumption rates ([Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], respectively) at 10°C. Hypoxia tolerance was determined as the DO at which loss of equilibrium (LOE) occurred in a constantly decreasing DO environment. There was no difference in [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], or aerobic scope between fish raised in hypoxia or normoxia. There was some evidence that hypoxia tolerance was lower (higher DO at LOE) in hypoxia - raised fish compared with those raised in normoxia, but the magnitude of the effect was small (12.52% DO vs. 11.73% DO at LOE). Acute hypoxia significantly reduced aerobic scope by reducing [Formula: see text], while [Formula: see text] remained unchanged. Interestingly, acute hypoxia uncovered individual -level relationships between DO at LOE and [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and aerobic scope. We discuss our findings in the context of developmental trajectories and the role of aerobic performance in hypoxia tolerance.

28460374|t|LDL particle number and size and cardiovascular risk: anything new under the sun?
28460374|a|We provide here an up-to-date perspective on the potential use of LDL particle number and size as complementary risk factors to predict and manage cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in the clinical realm. Studies show that a significant proportion of the population has discordant LDL particle number and cholesterol indices [non-HDL cholesterol (HDL-C)]. Data also show that risk prediction may be improved when using information on LDL particle number in patients with discordant particle number and cholesterol data. Yet, most of the current CVD guidelines conclude that LDL particle number is not superior to cholesterol indices, including non-HDL-C concentrations, in predicting CVD risk. LDL particle size, on the other hand, has not been independently associated with CVD risk after adjustment for other risk factors such as LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and HDL-C and that routine use of information pertaining to particle size to determine and manage patients' risk is not yet justified. Additional studies are required to settle the debate on which of cholesterol indices and LDL particle number is the best predictor of CVD risk, and if such measures should be integrated in clinical practice.

28462032|t|The emerging contribution of social wasps to grape rot disease ecology
28462032|a|Grape sour (bunch) rot is a polymicrobial disease of vineyards that causes millions of dollars in lost revenue per year due to decreased quality of grapes and resultant wine. The disease is associated with damaged berries infected with a community of acetic acid bacteria, yeasts, and filamentous fungi that results in rotting berries with high amounts of undesirable volatile acidity. Many insect species cause the initial grape berry damage that can lead to this disease, but most studies have focused on the role of fruit flies in facilitating symptoms and vectoring the microorganisms of this disease complex. Like fruit flies, social wasps are abundant in vineyards where they feed on ripe berries and cause significant damage, while also dispersing yeasts involved in wine fermentation. Despite this, their possible role in disease facilitation and dispersal of grape rots has not been explored. We tested the hypothesis that the paper wasp Polistes dominulus could facilitate grape sour rot in the absence of other insect vectors. Using marker gene sequencing we characterized the bacterial and fungal community of wild-caught adults. We used a sterilized foraging arena to determine if these wasps transfer viable microorganisms when foraging. We then tested if wasps harboring their native microbial community, or those inoculated with sour rot, had an effect on grape sour rot incidence and severity using a laboratory foraging arena. We found that all wasps harbor some portion of the sour rot microbial community and that they have the ability to transfer viable microorganisms when foraging. Foraging by inoculated and uninoculated wasps led to an increase in berry rot disease symptom severity and incidence. Our results indicate that paper wasps can facilitate sour rot diseases in the absence of other vectors and that the mechanism of this facilitation may include both increasing host susceptibility and transmitting these microbial communities to the grapes. Social wasps are understudied but relevant players in the sour rot ecology of vineyards.

28463085|t|Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound reduces periodontal atrophy in occlusal hypofunctional teeth
28463085|a|To clarify whether low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) exposure has recovery effects on the hypofunctional periodontal ligament (PDL) and interradicular alveolar bone (IRAB). Twelve- week -old male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups (n = 5 each): a normal occlusion (C) group, an occlusal hypofunction (H) group, and an occlusal hypofunction group subjected to LIPUS (HL) treatment. Hypofunctional occlusion of the maxillary first molar (M1) of the H and HL groups was induced by the bite-raising technique. Only the HL group was irradiated with LIPUS for 5 days. The IRAB and PDL of M1 were examined by microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) analysis. To quantify mRNA expression of cytokines involved in PDL proliferation and development, real-time reverse transcription quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed for twist family bHLH transcription factor 1 (Twist1), periostin, and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in the PDL samples. Micro-CT analysis showed that the PDL volume was decreased in the H group compared with that of the C and HL groups. Both bone volume per tissue volume (BV / TV) of IRAB was decreased in the H group compared with that in the C group. LIPUS exposure restored BV / TV in the IRAB of the HL group. qRT-PCR analysis showed that Twist1, periostin, and CTGF mRNA levels were decreased in the H group and increased in the HL group. LIPUS exposure reduced the atrophic changes of alveolar bone by inducing the upregulation of periostin and CTGF expression to promote PDL healing after induction of occlusal hypofunction.

28464019|t|Radiologic assessment of quality of root canal fillings and periapical status in an Austrian subpopulation - An observational study
28464019|a|Progress in endodontic techniques and methodological advances have altered root canal therapy over the last decades. These techniques and methods need periodical documentation. This observational study determined the current prevalence of endodontic treatments, and investigated the relationship of various factors with the periapical status in a Lower Austrian subpopulation. One thousand orthopantomograms of first-time university adult patients radiographed at an outpatient clinic were evaluated. For each tooth, the presence of periradicular pathosis and/or endodontic treatment was recorded, as was the quality of (post-) endodontic treatment (homogeneity and length of root canal fillings; preparation failures; posts / screws; apicoectomies; coronal restorations). Two evaluators, blinded to each other, scored all teeth. In cases of disagreement, they joined for a consensus score. In all, 22,586 teeth were counted. Of these, 2,907 teeth (12.9%) had periapical pathosis, while 2,504 teeth had undergone root canal treatment. Of the endodontically treated teeth, 52% showed no radiographic signs of apical periodontitis, while 44.9% had overt apical lesions, and 3,1% revealed widened periodontal ligament space. The majority of the root canal fillings was inhomogeneous (70.4%); 75.4% were rated too short, and 3.8% too long. The presence of apical pathosis was significantly correlated (odds ratio (OR) 2.556 [confidence interval (CI) 2.076-3.146]; P<0.0001) with poor root canal fillings (length and homogeneity). Posts or screws positively affected periapical status (OR 1.853 [CI 1.219-2.819]; P = 0.004), but endodontically treated posterior teeth were infrequently restored (posts, 7.5%; screws, 2.7%). Best results were found for teeth with both appropriate endodontic treatment and adequate coronal restoration. A high prevalence of periradicular radiolucencies was observed with root canal filled teeth, along with high numbers of unmet treatment needs. Periapical health was associated with adequate root canal obturation and high-grade postendodontic restorations, and quality regarding these latter aspects is considered mandatory to promote periapical health.

28464071|t|Chemical composition and amino acid digestibility of soybean meal produced in the United States, China, Argentina, Brazil, or India
28464071|a|An experiment was conducted to compare nutritional composition of soybean meal (SBM) produced in China, Argentina, Brazil, the U.S ., or India and the apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and the standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of CP and AA in these SBM when fed to growing pigs. Five sources of SBM from China, Argentina, Brazil, and the U.S ., and 4 sources from India were collected for a total of 24 sources of SBM. All samples were analyzed for energy, DM, and nutrients, and each source was included in a cornstarch based diet in which SBM was the only AA contributing ingredient. An N-free diet was also formulated. Twenty-five barrows (initial BW: 30.53 ± 1.73 kg) were equipped with a T-cannula in the distal ileum and randomly allotted to a 25 × 8 Youden square design with 25 diets and 8 periods. Results indicate that the concentration of CP was greater (< 0.05) in SBM from Brazil and India (49.3 and 49.5%, respectively) than in SBM from China, Argentina, or the U.S. (45.1, 46.7, and 47.3%, respectively, as-fed basis). The concentration of most indispensable AA followed the same pattern as CP with the exception that SBM from the U.S. contained more (< 0.05) indispensable AA than SBM from China or Argentina. However, SBM from India contained more (< 0.05) trypsin inhibitors than SBM from the other countries. A greater (< 0.05) AID and SID of CP and most AA was observed in SBM from the U.S. compared with SBM from Brazil, Argentina, and India, but there were no differences between SBM from the U.S. and SBM from China. However, because of the lower concentration of AA in SBM from China, the concentration of standardized ileal digestible AA in SBM from China was less (< 0.05) than in SBM from the U.S. Soybean meal from the U.S. or Brazil had less (< 0.05) variability in SID values than SBM from Argentina, China, or India. In conclusion, the SID of CP and AA is dependent on the country where the SBM is produced. This difference and the variability within each country should be evaluated when formulating diets for pigs.

28464291|t|Developing understanding of object fall: Going beyond inhibitory processes
28464291|a|A study is reported where 118 participants aged between 10 years and early 20s drew the trajectories they expected objects to follow as they fell. The younger participants typically anticipated backward trajectories during fall from moving carriers while forward but non-parabolic trajectories were relatively more frequent amongst the older participants. Both patterns suggest strong sociocultural influences, with implications for models that regard development in this area as purely the inhibition of principles established in infancy. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Research with infants demonstrates an early - established belief that dropped objects fall straight down. The erroneous expectations that pre-schoolers hold about object fall are consistent with failure to inhibit the presumption of straight - down fall, in contexts where it is inappropriate. What does this study add? The research replicates and extends research with older participants, which indicates errors that cannot be explained via failed inhibition of straight - down fall. It is the first study to trace patterns of errors across late childhood, adolescence and early adulthood. A consequence of the findings is that adequate modelling in developmental psychology must consider multilayered interactions between prior representations and sociocultural experiences.

28464602|t|Attenuation of High Glucose - Induced Rat Cardiomyocyte Apoptosis by Exendin-4 via Intervention of HO-1 / Nrf-2 and the PI3K/AKT Signaling Pathway
28464602|a|Exendin-4, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, demonstrated cytoprotective actions beyond glycemic control in recent studies. The aims of the present study were to investigate the effects of exendin-4 on high glucose (HG)- induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and the possible mechanisms. Rat cardiomyocytes were divided into 3 groups: normal glucose group (NG group), HG group and HG + exendin-4 group (HG + Ex Group). Cardiomyocyte apoptosis was evaluated by double-staining with annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/ propidium iodide (PI) and flow cytometry. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was detected by 2’,7’-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCHF-DA) incubation and fluorescence microscopy. LY294002 (LY), a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway inhibitor, was added to the medium of the HG + Ex + LY Group for further western blot analysis. The proteins analyzed involved oxidative stress - associated proteins, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2), and apoptosis - associated proteins, caspase-3, Bax/B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and p-AKT / AKT. HG treatment induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis (P = 0.00) and clearly upregulated ROS production (P = 0.00); exendin-4 co-incubation also ameliorated cardiomyocyte apoptosis (P = 0.004) and decreased ROS (P = 0.00) level significantly. HO-1 and Nrf-2 protein expression levels decreased significantly in the HG group (P < 0.05), but the levels were elevated by exendin-4 intervention (P < 0.05). Furthermore, exendin-4 attenuated HG - induced higher protein expression, including cleaved caspase-3 and Bax, increased the expression of Bcl-2 protein (P < 0.05). However, these impacts of exendin-4 were counteracted significantly by co-incubation with LY294002. In addition, exendin-4 ameliorated HG - induced p-AKT / AKT lower expression, and this impact was also suppressed by LY294002. Exendin-4 ameliorates HG - induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and the mechanisms may involve anti-oxidative stress via the HO-1 / Nrf-2 system, as well as intervention of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.

28465793|t|KMAP-O framework for care management research of patients with type 2 diabetes
28465793|a|To review impacts of interventions involving self-management education, health coaching, and motivational interviewing for type 2 diabetes. A thorough review of the scientific literature on diabetes care and management was executed by a research team. This article summarizes important findings in regard to the validity of developing a comprehensive behavioral system as a framework for empirical investigation. The behavioral system framework consists of patients ' knowledge (K), motivation (M), attitude (A), and practice (P) as predictor variables for diabetes care outcomes (O). Care management strategies or health education programs serve as the intervention variable that directly influences K, M, A, and P and then indirectly affects the variability in patient care outcomes of patients with type 2 diabetes. This review contributes to the understanding of the KMAP-O framework and how it can guide the care management of patients with type 2 diabetes. It will allow the tailoring of interventions to be more effective through knowledge enhancement, increased motivation, attitudinal changes, and improved preventive practice to reduce the progression of type 2 diabetes and comorbidities. Furthermore, the use of health information technology for enhancing changes in KMAP and communications is advocated in health promotion and development.

28466379|t|Bayesian and Phylogenic Approaches for Studying Relationships among Table Olive Cultivars
28466379|a|To enhance table olive tree authentication, relationship, and productivity, we consider the analysis of 18 worldwide table olive cultivars (Olea europaea L.) based on morphological, biological, and physicochemical markers analyzed by bioinformatic and biostatistic tools. Accordingly, we assess the relationships between the studied varieties, on the one hand, and the potential productivity - quantitative parameter links on the other hand. The bioinformatic analysis based on the graphical representation of the matrix of Euclidean distances, the principal components analysis, unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean, and principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) revealed three major clusters which were not correlated with the geographic origin. The statistical analysis based on Kendall's and Spearman correlation coefficients suggests two highly significant associations with both fruit color and pollinization and the productivity character. These results are confirmed by the multiple linear regression prediction models. In fact, based on the coefficient of determination (R (2)) value, the best model demonstrated the power of the pollinization on the tree productivity (R (2) = 0.846). Moreover, the derived directed acyclic graph showed that only two direct influences are detected: effect of tolerance on fruit and stone symmetry on side and effect of tolerance on stone form and oil content on the other side. This work provides better understanding of the diversity available in worldwide table olive cultivars and supplies an important contribution for olive breeding and authenticity.

28468714|t|The Indications for Laparoscopic Pancreatectomy
28468714|a|Laparoscopic pancreatectomy is not yet established as a routine procedure everywhere in Germany or in other countries. Few data are available on its short- and long-term outcomes. From 2008 onward, a working group initiated by 10 centers and currently comprising 34 centers has gathered data on all cases of laparoscopic pancreatectomy. Procedures in which laparoscopy was converted to open surgery are also included. The registry now contains 550 data sets representing 267 cases of benign disease, 244 malignancies, and 39 borderline tumors. The most common procedure was laparoscopic left pancreatectomy, followed by resection of the head of the pancreas and tumor enucleation. The most common intraoperative complication was hemorrhage, with a frequency of 3%. The rate of conversion to open surgery was 35%; if minilaparotomies are excluded, the conversion rate was only 16%. 39% of patients developed a pancreatic fistula after surgery (usually grade A or B, with 1.5% grade C) and 3% underwent reoperation because of postoperative hemorrhage. The procedure-related mortality was 1.3%. 91% of the patients reported only very mild postoperative pain. 6.7% newly developed diabetes mellitus after the procedure. The patient cohort in the registry consists of persons who were selected to undergo laparoscopic pancreatectomy by the participating hospital teams, and the data are thus inherently affected by selection bias. The operative procedures that they underwent reflect the current practice of laparoscopic pancreatectomy in Germany. The complication rates are similar to those of open surgery. Selection bias can be avoided only by a randomized trial.

28470106|t|Associations of NEUROD2 polymorphisms and change of cognitive dysfunctions in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder after eight weeks of antipsychotic treatment
28470106|a|NEUROD2 is a neurospecific helix-loop-helix transcription factor which has an impact on the regulation of glutamatergic and GABAergic genes. We investigated an association of NEUROD2 with neurocognitive dysfunctions in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder patients before and during treatment with different second-generation antipsychotics. Patients were genotyped for four different polymorphisms of the NEUROD2 gene ((rs9889354(A/G), rs1877032(C/T), rs12453682(C/T) and rs11078918(C/G)). Cognitive function was assessed at baseline and week 8. Results of individual neuropsychological tests were assigned to six cognitive domains (reaction time and quality; executive function; working, verbal and visual memory) and a general cognitive index. 167 patients were included in the study. The NEUROD2 exonic polymorphism rs11078918 showed significant associations with verbal memory and executive functions, whereas the NEUROD2 polymorphism rs12453682 was significantly associated with working and verbal memory, executive functions and with a cognitive index. Significant associations were found at baseline and after eight weeks. Moreover, significant associations between the change in neuropsychological test results during antipsychotic treatment and the NEUROD2 polymorphisms rs11078918 and rs12453682 were observed. Our findings suggest that the NEUROD2 gene could play a role in the pathophysiology of neurocognitive dysfunctions as well as in the change of cognitive symptoms under antipsychotic treatment in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.

28470753|t|Stalk versus base invasion in pT1 papillary cancers of the bladder: improved substaging system predicting risk of progression
28470753|a|Pathologic stage T1 (pT1) bladder cancers are a clinically heterogeneous group. However, current staging guidelines for superficially invasive cancers do not acknowledge the variability in type and extent of lamina propria invasion in papillary urothelial carcinomas (PUC), and historically proposed substaging systems showed either high inter-observer variation or limited value in predicting patient outcomes. Herein we reappraise pT1 PUC substaging, aiming to identify a novel scheme which is reproducible and prognostically meaningful. Stage pT1 PUC diagnosed during years 1999-2015 were retrospectively reviewed and characterized as focal invasion confined to papillary stalk, focal invasion of tumor base, or extensive invasion of tumor base. Cases with concurrent flat carcinoma in-situ, angiolymphatic invasion, absent muscularis propria, or clinically advanced disease were excluded. We calculated cumulative incidence of recurrence, progression, and death by tumor subtype and evaluated differential risks using log-rank tests and Kaplan-Meier curves stratified by type and extent of invasion. Among 62 patients satisfying inclusion criteria, 22 of 29 patients with base extensive invasion progressed while 4 of 13 with base focal and 0 of 20 with stalk only invasion progressed. There was strong evidence that base extensive patients had higher risk of progression and death due to bladder cancer than base focal or stalk only counterparts (P<0.0001). However, tumor subtype was not significantly associated with risk of recurrence (P=0.21). We propose an innovative substaging approach for reporting site and extent of lamina propria invasion in patients with pT1 PUC allowing patient stratification for risk of progression.

28471941|t|Basic science and pathogenesis of ageing with HIV: potential mechanisms and biomarkers
28471941|a|: The increased prevalence of age -related comorbidities and mortality is worrisome in ageing HIV-infected patients. Here, we aim to analyse the different ageing mechanisms with regard to HIV infection. Ageing results from the time - dependent accumulation of random cellular damage. Epigenetic modifications and mitochondrial DNA haplogroups modulate ageing. In antiretroviral treatment -controlled patients, epigenetic clock appears to be advanced, and some haplogroups are associated with HIV infection severity. Telomere shortening is enhanced in HIV-infected patients because of HIV and some nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Mitochondria -related oxidative stress and mitochondrial DNA mutations are increased during ageing and also by some nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Overall, increased inflammation or ' inflammageing ' is a major driver of ageing and could result from cell senescence with secreted proinflammatory mediators, altered gut microbiota, and coinfections. In HIV-infected patients, the level of inflammation and innate immunity activation is enhanced and related to most comorbidities and to mortality. This status could result, in addition to age, from the virus itself or viral protein released from reservoirs, from HIV -enhanced gut permeability and dysbiosis, from antiretroviral treatment, from frequent cytomegalovirus and hepatitis C virus coinfections, and also from personal and environmental factors, as central fat accumulation or smoking. Adaptive immune activation and immunosenescence are associated with comorbidities and mortality in the general population but are less predictive in HIV-infected patients. Biomarkers to evaluate ageing in HIV-infected patients are required. Numerous systemic or cellular inflammatory, immune activation, oxidative stress, or senescence markers can be tested in serum or peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The novel European Study to Establish Biomarkers of Human Ageing MARK-AGE algorithm, evaluating the biological age, is currently assessed in HIV-infected patients and reveals an advanced biological age. Some enhanced inflammatory or innate immune activation markers are interesting but still not validated for the patient's follow-up. To be able to assess patients ' biological age is an important objective to improve their healthspan.

28473015|t|MESOTHELIAL CELL ADHERENCE TO VASCULAR PROSTHESES AND THEIR SUBSEQUENT GROWTH IN VITRO
28473015|a|Cell seeding may decrease the thrombogenicity of implanted vascular grafts, but its application is hampered by the limited availability of autologous endothelial cells. Human peritoneal mesothelial cells have blood flow supporting qualities and are readily available. This study investigated the adherence of mesothelial cells to vascular prostheses and their subsequent growth in vitro. Circular pieces of various vascular prosthetic materials were seeded with 51Chromium-labeled mesothelial and endothelial cells and left for either 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 minutes. The unattached cells were removed and the degree of cell attachment was measured. The number of mesothelial cells to Dacron increased during the first 60 min up to 35.2 % of the seeded inoculum where after a plateau was reached. Scanning electron microscopy showed spreaded mesothelial cells adherent to the Dacron fibers. A significant increase in adherence was observed after preincubation of Dacron with 10 μg/mL fibronectin, but no improvement was found after preincubation with human serum albumin or gelatin. Mesothelial cells adhered better to Gelcoated than to Gelsealed or plain Dacron. The adherence of mesothelial cells to ePTFE (Teflon) was significantly poorer. No significant differences in adherence were found between mesothelial and endothelial cells. Mesothelial cell growth on Dacron resulted in a modest increase in the number of viable cells during 27 days, which implies biocompatibility of Dacron and mesothelial cells in vitro.

28473640|a|Recent functional imaging studies have proposed that the human entorhinal cortex is subdivided into functionally distinct anterolateral (alERC) and posteromedial (pmERC) subregions. The alERC overlaps with regions that are affected earliest by Alzheimer's disease pathology, yet its cognitive function remains poorly understood. Previous human fMRI studies have focused on its role in object memory, but rodent studies on the putatively homologous lateral entorhinal cortex suggest that it also plays an important role in representing spatial properties of objects. In order to investigate the cognitive effects of human alERC volume differences, we developed an eyetracking-based task to evaluate intra-item configural processing (i.e., processing the arrangement of an object's features), and used manual segmentation based on a recently- developed protocol to delineate the alERC / pmERC as well as other medial temporal lobe (MTL) subregions. In a group of older adult men and women at varying stages of brain atrophy and cognitive decline, we found that intra-item configural processing - regardless of an object's novelty - was strongly predicted by alERC volume, but not by the volume of any other MTL subregion. These results provide the first evidence that the human alERC plays a role in supporting a distinct aspect of object processing, namely attending to the arrangement of an object's component features.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Alzheimer's disease pathology appears earliest in brain regions that overlap with the anterolateral entorhinal cortex (alERC). However, the cognitive role of the alERC is poorly understood. Previous human studies treat the alERC as an extension of the neighboring perirhinal cortex, supporting object memory. Animal studies suggest that the alERC may support the spatial properties of objects. In a group of older adult humans at the earliest stages of cognitive decline, we show that alERC volume selectively predicted configural processing (attention to the spatial arrangement of an object's parts). This is the first study to demonstrate a cognitive role related to alERC volume in humans. This task can be adapted to serve as an early detection method for Alzheimer's disease pathology.

28476271|t|Alcohol brief intervention in primary care: Blood pressure outcomes in hypertensive patients
28476271|a|In clinical trials alcohol brief intervention (BI) in adult primary care has been efficacious in reducing alcohol consumption, but we know little about its impact on health outcomes. Hypertension is a prevalent and costly chronic condition in the U.S. and worldwide, and alcohol use is a modifiable hypertension risk factor. To evaluate the effect of receiving BI for unhealthy drinking on blood pressure (BP) control among adult hypertensive patients by analyzing secondary data from a clustered, randomized controlled trial on alcohol screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment (SBIRT) implementation by primary care physicians (PCP intervention arm) and non-physician providers and medical assistants (NPP & MA intervention arm) in a large, integrated health care delivery system. Observational, prospective cohort study. 3811 adult hypertensive primary care patients screening positive for past-year heavy drinking at baseline, of which 1422 (37%) had an electronic health record BP measure at baseline and 18-month follow-up. Change in BP and controlled BP (systolic/diastolic BP <140/90 mmHg). Overall no significant associations were found between alcohol BI and BP change at 18-month follow-up when analyzing the combined sample of subjects in both intervention arms. However, moderation analyses found that receiving BI for positive past-year unhealthy drinking was positively associated with better BP control at 18months in the PCP intervention arm, and for those with lower heavy drinking frequency and poor BP control at the index screening. Our findings suggest that hypertensive patients may benefit from receiving physician brief intervention for unhealthy alcohol use in primary care. Findings also highlight potential population-level benefits of alcohol BI if widely applied, suggesting a need for the development of innovative strategies to facilitate SBIRT delivery in primary care settings.

28476381|t|Unusual asymptomatic presentation of bladder cancer metastatic to the penis
28476381|a|Penile metastasis is an extremely rare event and mainly originate from primary pelvic tumor sites such us urinary bladder, gastro-intestinal tract and prostate and more rarely from respiratory system, bone tumors and melanoma. Here we describe the unusual presentation of two bladder urothelial cancer metastatic to the penis with no relevant clinical symptoms. Namely, a 69 years-old man with a warthy lesions of the foreskin and the glans misunderstood for a condylomata that at histological and immunohistochemical analysis showed a bladder urothelial carcinoma; and a 71 years-old man with reddish skin lesion of the glans, a previous history of bladder and urethral carcinoma and histological pagetoid spread of urothelial cancer to the glans. Recurrent bladder urothelial carcinoma is usually a visceral disease that rarely presents as a superficial asymptomatic skin lesion. The two reported cases were asymptomatic superficial penis metastases with a relatively slow growth and a fairy good prognosis after conservative surgical approach. Accurate clinical examination of the penis is mandatory for males with history of bladder cancer.

28478321|t|The bachelorette: Female Siamese fighting fish avoid males exposed to an estrogen mimic
28478321|a|Due to improper disposal and a lack of removal during the wastewater treatment process, endocrine disrupting chemicals enter aquatic ecosystems where they exert detrimental effects on fish behavior and physiology. Perhaps the most well-studied and prevalent EDC is 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2), an active ingredient in oral contraceptives, which is known to cause dramatic reductions in male -typical behaviors. While it is likely that alterations in male courtship behavior decrease reproductive fitness, this is rarely explicitly examined. To this end, whether EE2 exposure reduces male attractiveness to female Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendens, was investigated by showing females video images of exposed and unexposed males. Females were randomly assigned to one of two exposure conditions (exposed to EE2, control) and each subject then viewed four different video combinations of male conspecifics (courting exposed + exposed; courting unexposed + unexposed; courting unexposed + exposed; swimming unexposed + exposed). Females, regardless of whether or not they were exposed to EE2, directed markedly less behavior towards exposed males, especially when they viewed an exposed male and an unexposed male simultaneously. These findings demonstrate that EE2 can have significant individual - and population-level consequences on fitness by disrupting sexual selection and, ultimately, the success of exposed males.

28478867|t|Targeting accuracy of single-isocenter intensity-modulated radiosurgery for multiple lesions
28478867|a|To investigate the targeting accuracy of intensity-modulated SRS (IMRS) plans designed to simultaneously treat multiple brain metastases with a single isocenter. A home-made acrylic phantom able to support a film (EBT3) in its coronal plane was used. The phantom was CT scanned and three coplanar small targets (a central and two peripheral) were outlined in the Eclipse system. Peripheral targets were 6 cm apart from the central one. A reference IMRS plan was designed to simultaneously treat the three targets, but only a single isocenter located at the center of the central target was used. After positioning the phantom on the linac using the room lasers, a CBCT scan was acquired and the reference plan were mapped on it, by placing the planned isocenter at the intersection of the landmarks used in the film showing the linac isocenter. The mapped plan was then recalculated and delivered. The film dose distribution was derived using a cloud computing application (www.radiochromic.com) that uses a triple-channel dosimetry algorithm. Comparison of dose distributions using the gamma index (5%/1 mm) were performed over a 5 × 5 cm(2) region centered over each target. 2D shifts required to get the best gamma passing rates on the peripheral target regions were compared with the reported ones for the central target. The experiment was repeated ten times in different sessions. Average 2D shifts required to achieve optimal gamma passing rates (99%, 97%, 99%) were 0.7 mm (SD: 0.3 mm), 0.8 mm (SD: 0.4 mm) and 0.8 mm (SD: 0.3 mm), for the central and the two peripheral targets, respectively. No statistical differences (p > 0.05) were found for targeting accuracy between the central and the two peripheral targets. The study revealed a targeting accuracy within 1 mm for off- isocenter targets within 6 cm of the linac isocenter, when a single-isocenter IMRS plan is designed.

28479259|t|Physical activity limits the effects of age and Alzheimer's disease on postural control
28479259|a|The aim was to study the possible influence of physical activity on the postural performance of subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The postural performance (i.e. surface area of the center of foot pressure displacement) of 3 groups was compared: Alzheimer active group (AA), Alzheimer non-active group (ANA) and healthy non-active group (HNA). The AA group's postural performance was superior to that of the ANA and HNA groups. AD disturbed postural performance but participation in regular physical activity made it possible to limit the disturbing effects of AD to a surprising extent, since the postural performance of active AD subjects was also superior to that of healthy subjects.

28483530|t|LAMP-2 mediates oxidative stress -dependent cell death in Zn(2+) - treated lung epithelium cells
28483530|a|Zinc is an essential element for the biological system. However, excessive exogenous Zn(2+) would disrupt cellular Zn(2+) homeostasis and cause toxicity. In particular, Zinc salts or ZnO nanoparticles exposure could induce respiratory injury. Although previous studies have indicated that organelle damage (including mitochondria or lysosomes) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production are involved in Zn(2+) -induced toxicity, the interplay between mitochondria / lysosomes damage and ROS production is obscure. Herein, we demonstrated that Zn(2+) could induce deglycosylation of lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 and 2 (LAMP-1 and LAMP-2), which primarily locate in late endosomes / lysosomes, in A549 lung epithelium cells. Intriguingly, LAMP-2 knockdown further aggravated Zn(2+) -mediated ROS production and cell death, indicating LAMP-2 (not LAMP-1) was involved in Zn(2+) -induced toxicity. Our results provide a new insight that LAMP-2 contributes to the ROS clearance and cell death induced by Zn(2+) treatment, which would help us to get a better understanding of Zn(2+) -induced toxicity in respiratory system.

28485130|t|Fluorescence hyperspectral imaging (fHSI) using a spectrally resolved detector array
28485130|a|The ability to resolve multiple fluorescent emissions from different biological targets in video rate applications, such as endoscopy and intraoperative imaging, has traditionally been limited by the use of filter-based imaging systems. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) facilitates the detection of both spatial and spectral information in a single data acquisition, however, instrumentation for HSI is typically complex, bulky and expensive. We sought to overcome these limitations using a novel robust and low cost HSI camera based on a spectrally resolved detector array (SRDA). We integrated this HSI camera into a wide-field reflectance-based imaging system operating in the near-infrared range to assess the suitability for in vivo imaging of exogenous fluorescent contrast agents. Using this fluorescence HSI (fHSI) system, we were able to accurately resolve the presence and concentration of at least 7 fluorescent dyes in solution. We also demonstrate high spectral unmixing precision, signal linearity with dye concentration and at depth in tissue mimicking phantoms, and delineate 4 fluorescent dyes in vivo. Our approach, including statistical background removal, could be directly generalised to broader spectral ranges, for example, to resolve tissue reflectance or autofluorescence and in future be tailored to video rate applications requiring snapshot HSI data acquisition.

28485268|t|Biochemical studies of amylase, lipase and protease in Callosobruchus maculatus (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) populations fed with Vigna unguiculata grain cultivated with diazotrophic bacteria strains
28485268|a|The objective of this study was to evaluate the enzymatic activity of homogenates of insects fed on grain of cowpea, Vigna unguiculata (L.), cultivars grown with different nitrogen sources. For the experiment we used aliquots of the homogenate of 100 unsexed adult insects, emerged from 10 g of grain obtained from four cowpea cultivars: ' BRS Acauã ', ' BRS Carijó ', ' BRS Pujante ', and ' BRS Tapaihum ' grown under different regimes of nitrogen sources: mineral fertilizer, inoculation with strains of diazotrophs (BR 3267, BR 3262, BR 3299; INPA 03-11B, 03-84 UFLA, as well as the control (with soil nitrogen). The parameters evaluated were enzymatic activities of insect protease, amylase and lipase and the starch content of the grains. There were differences in the enzymatic activity of amylase, lipase and protease of insect homogenate according to the food source. A lower activity of the enzyme amylase from C. maculatus homogenate was observed when insects were fed grain of the cultivar BRS Carijó. A lower activity of lipase enzyme from C. maculatus homogenate was observed when the insects fed on grain from the interaction of the cultivar Tapaihum inoculated with BR 3262 diazotrophs. The lowest proteolytic activity was observed in homogenate of insects fed on interaction of ' BRS Carijó ' inoculated with BR 3262 diazotroph s. Starch content correlated positively with the amylase activity of C. maculatus homogenate. The cultivar BRS Carijó had a different behavior from the other cultivars, according to the cluster analysis.

28485296|t|The correlation of the results of the survey SNOT-20 of objective studies of nasal obstruction and the geometry of the nasal cavities
28485296|a|In this paper were verified the correlation between the results of the survey SNOT-20 and the results of the objective tests of nasal obstruction which are rhinomanometry and acoustic rhinometry before and after surgical treatment, such as septoplasty, septoconchoplasty, ethmoidectomy and septoethmoidectomy. The material used in this study was 233 patients diagnosed routinely in the Rhinomanometry Laboratory of the Department of Otolaryngology at the Medical University of Warsaw, reporting rhinological problems. Data were obtained from 70 women (31,4%) ranging in ages from 18 to 81 years of age and 153 men (68,6%) ranging in ages from 16 to 81 years of age. The researches presented in the study were made using the device RhinoMetrics SRE 2100 which combines the Rhinomanometer (RhinoStream) and Acoustic Rhinometer (RhinoScan) Interacoustics AS (Denmark). Survey SNOT-20 (Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-20) in Polish was completed by patients before surgery and during the postoperative control visits. The calculated correlations between the objective parameter, which was the resistance to the flow of air through the nasal cavity, and the subjective feelings of respondents expressed in the survey SNOT-20 were generally weak, and statistical significance was achieved with respect to the first question survey (the severity of the nose obstruction) for all components of resistance flow. The feeling of nasal obstruction is the most reproducible and reliable complaint reported by the patient with rhinological problems.

28486935|t|Emergency department use and barriers to wellness: a survey of emergency department frequent users
28486935|a|There is no common understanding of how needs of emergency department (ED) frequent users differ from other patients. This study sought to examine how to best serve this population. Examinations of why ED frequent users present to the ED, what barriers to care exist, and what service offerings may help these patients achieve an optimal level of health were conducted. We performed a prospective study of frequent ED users in an adult only, level 1 trauma center with approximately 90,000 visits per year. Frequent ED users were defined as those who make four or more ED visits in a 12 month period. Participants were administered a piloted structured interview by a trained researcher querying demographics, ED usage, perceived barriers to care, and potential aids to maintaining health. Of 1,523 screened patients, 297 were identified as frequent ED users. One hundred frequent ED users were enrolled. The mean age was 48 years (95% CI 45-51). The majority of subjects were female (64%, 64/100, 95% CI 55-73%), white (61%, 60/98, 95% CI 52-71%) and insured by Medicaid (55%, 47/86, 95% CI 44-65%) or Medicare (23%, 20/86, 95% CI 14-32%). Subjects had a median of 6 ED visits, and 2 inpatient admissions in the past 12 months at this hospital. Most frequent ED users (61%, 59/96, 95% CI 52-71%) stated the primary reason for their visit was that they felt that their health problem could only be treated in an ED. Transportation presented as a major barrier to few patients (7%, 7/95, 95% CI 3-14%). Subjects stated that " after-hours options, besides the ED for minor health issues " (63%, 60/95, 95% CI 53-73%) and having "a nurse to work with you one-on-one to help manage health care needs " (53%, 50/95, 95% CI 43-63%) would be most helpful in achieving optimal health. This study characterized ED frequent users and identified several opportunities to better serve this population. By understanding barriers to care from the patient perspective, health systems can potentially address unmet needs that prevent wellness in this population.

28490164|t|Contralateral Superior Cerebellar Artery Syndrome: A Consequence of Brain Herniation
28490164|a|Vascular compromise is a well-known consequence of brain herniation syndromes. Transtentorial brain herniation most often involves posterior cerebral arteries. However, isolated involvement of contralateral superior cerebellar artery (SCA) during unilateral impending brain herniation is reported only once and we present another case of this exceedingly rare entity. A 24-year-old man was referred to us with impending herniation due to a multiloculated hydrocephalus, and during the course of illness, he developed an isolated SCA ischemia in the opposite side of the most dilated entrapped horn. In the current article we discuss the probable pathophysiologic mechanisms of this phenomenon, as well as recommending more inclusive brain studies in cases suspected of Kernohan-Woltman notch phenomenon in unilateral brain herniation. The rationale for this commentary is that contralateral SCA transient ischemia or infarct might be the underdiagnosed underlying pathomechanism of ipsilateral hemiparesis occurring in many cases of this somehow vague phenomenon.

28490376|t|The effects of clinical supervision on supervisees and patients in cognitive-behavioral therapy: a study protocol for a systematic review
28490376|a|Clinical supervision by a senior therapist is a very common practice in psychotherapist training and psychiatric care settings. Though clinical supervision is advocated by most educational and governing institutions, the effects of clinical supervision on the supervisees ' competence, e.g., attitudes, behaviors, and skills, as well as on treatment outcomes and other patient variables are debated and largely unknown. Evidence-based practice is advocated in clinical settings but has not yet been fully implemented in educational or clinical training settings. The aim of this systematic review is to synthesize and present the empirical literature regarding effects of clinical supervision in cognitive-behavioral therapy. This study will include a systematic review of the literature to identify studies that have empirically investigated the effects of supervision on supervised psychotherapists and/or the supervisees' patients. A comprehensive search strategy will be conducted to identify published controlled studies indexed in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library databases. Data on supervision outcomes in both psychotherapists and their patients will be extracted, synthesized, and reported. Risk of bias and quality of the included studies will be assessed systematically. This systematic review will rigorously follow established guidelines for systematic reviews in order to summarize and present the evidence base for clinical supervision in cognitive-behavioral therapy and may aid further research and discussion in this area.

28492106|t|Higher risk of revision for infection using systemic clindamycin prophylaxis than with cloxacillin
28492106|a|Background and purpose - Clindamycin has not been compared with other antibiotics for prophylaxis in arthroplasty. Since 2009, the Swedish Knee Arthroplasty Register (SKAR) has been collecting information on the prophylactic antibiotic regime used at every individual operation. In Sweden, when there is allergy to penicillin, clindamycin has been the recommended alternative. We examined whether there were differences in the rate of revision due to infection depending on which antibiotic was used as systemic prophylaxis. Patients and methods - Patients who had a total knee arthroplasty (TKA) performed due to osteoarthritis (OA) during the years 2009-2015 were included in the study. Information on which antibiotic was used was available for 80,018 operations (55,530 patients). Survival statistics were used to calculate the rate of revision due to infection until the end of 2015, comparing the group of patients who received cloxacillin with those who received clindamycin as systemic prophylaxis. Results - Cloxacillin was used in 90% of the cases, clindamycin in 7%, and cephalosporins in 2%. The risk of being revised due to infection was higher when clindamycin was used than when cloxacillin was used (RR =1.5, 95% CI: 1.2-2.0; p = 0.001). There was no significant difference in the revision rate for other causes (p = 0.2). Interpretation - We advise that patients reporting allergic reaction to penicillin should have their allergic history explored. In the absence of a clear history of type-I allergic reaction (e.g. urticaria, anaphylaxis, or bronchospasm), we suggest the use of a third-generation cephalosporin instead of clindamycin as perioperative prophylaxis when undergoing a TKR. No recommendation can be given regarding patients with type-1 allergy.

28492483|t|PCVMZM: Using the Probabilistic Classification Vector Machines Model Combined with a Zernike Moments Descriptor to Predict Protein-Protein Interactions from Protein Sequences
28492483|a|Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are essential for most living organisms ' process. Thus, detecting PPIs is extremely important to understand the molecular mechanisms of biological systems. Although many PPIs data have been generated by high-throughput technologies for a variety of organisms, the whole interatom is still far from complete. In addition, the high-throughput technologies for detecting PPIs has some unavoidable defects, including time consumption, high cost, and high error rate. In recent years, with the development of machine learning, computational methods have been broadly used to predict PPIs, and can achieve good prediction rate. In this paper, we present here PCVMZM, a computational method based on a Probabilistic Classification Vector Machines (PCVM) model and Zernike moments (ZM) descriptor for predicting the PPIs from protein amino acids sequences. Specifically, a Zernike moments (ZM) descriptor is used to extract protein evolutionary information from Position-Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM) generated by Position-Specific Iterated Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (PSI-BLAST). Then, PCVM classifier is used to infer the interactions among protein. When performed on PPIs datasets of Yeast and H. Pylori, the proposed method can achieve the average prediction accuracy of 94.48% and 91.25%, respectively. In order to further evaluate the performance of the proposed method, the state-of-the-art support vector machines (SVM) classifier is used and compares with the PCVM model. Experimental results on the Yeast dataset show that the performance of PCVM classifier is better than that of SVM classifier. The experimental results indicate that our proposed method is robust, powerful and feasible, which can be used as a helpful tool for proteomics research.

28493125|t|Conditional Knockdown of Endogenous MicroRNAs in CHO Cells Using TET-ON-SanDI Sponge Vectors
28493125|a|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNAs of about 22 nucleotides in length and have proven to be useful targets for genetic modifications for desirable phenotype in the biotech industry. The use of constitutively expressed " miRNA sponge" vectors in which multiple, tandem miRNA binding sites containing transcripts are transcriptionally regulated by a constitutive promoter for down regulating the levels of endogenous microRNAs in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells has shown to be more advantageous than using synthetic antisense oligonucleotides. The application of miRNA sponges in biotechnological processes, however, could be more effective, if expression of miRNA sponges could be tuned. In this chapter, we present a method for the generation of stable CHO cell lines expressing a TET-ON-SanDI-miRNA-sponge that is in theory expressed only in the presence of an inducer.

28494421|t|Forest protected areas governance in Zimbabwe: Shift needed away from a long history of local community exclusion
28494421|a|In this literature review based paper we explored the concept of exclusion of local communities from accessing resources in forest protected areas (FPAs) in Zimbabwe. We discussed the colonial and post - colonial forms, causes and mechanisms of exclusion and their social, economic and ecological outcomes. We examined the range of powers embodied in and exercised through various mechanisms, processes and social relations and their impact on local communities ' access to FPA resources and associated benefits along the historical trajectory of forest governance in Zimbabwe. Results showed that the forms and extent of exclusion changed over time in tandem with the shifting political and economic landscape. During the colonial period, it was total exclusion whereby people were evicted from forest land as well as being denied access to basic resources for their livelihoods. Local communities ' access to low value FPA resources improved during the post-colonial period but access to high value resources like commercial timber as well as sharing income benefits derived from FPA commercial activities remained a pipe dream. Regulation, legitimation, force and markets constituted the mixture of the power elements that FPA governing authorities used to exclude local communities. These powers remained intact despite attempts at collaborative governance in the 1990s. However, from the year 2000, local communities expressed their dissatisfaction with the centralised exclusionary governance system by invading the FPAs rendering them ungovernable. There is therefore a need for policy reform within the FPA sector to improve the current dire situation.

28495504|t|Renal arterial mycotic aneurysm after kidney transplantation
28495504|a|Mycotic aneurysm is a rare condition mostly attributable to Candida or Aspergillus species. About 20 cases of Candida -related arteritis have been reported in kidney transplant patients. Herein, we report the case of a 40-year- old man who received a kidney from a deceased donor in whom an accidental digestive wound was made during organ retrieval. He presented with sudden anuria 47 days after renal transplantation revealing a large mycotic aneurysm of the kidney graft renal artery. Organs derived from donors in whom a digestive breach is noticed should be used with caution.

28496002|t|Risk of cancer in patients with heart failure who use digoxin: a 10-year follow-up study and cell -based verification
28496002|a|Heart failure (HF) is the leading cause of death in the world and digoxin remains one of the oldest therapies for HF. However, its safety and efficacy have been controversial since its initial use and there is uncertainty about its long-term efficacy and safety. Recently, the repositioning of cardiac glycosides is to function in anti-tumor activity via multiple working pathways. It is interesting to compare the potential effects of digoxin in clinical patients and cell lines. First, we analyze patient information retrieved from the National Health Insurance Research database of Taiwan between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2000. This retrospective study included a study cohort (1,219 patients) and a comparison cohort. Our analytical data suggested that patients taking digoxin are at an increased risk of cancers, including breast, liver, and lung cancers, during the 10-year follow-up period. In contrast to the anti-tumor function of digoxin, we further examined the potential pathway of digoxin via the cell -based strategy using several breast cancer cell lines, including MCF-7, BT-474, MAD-MB-231, and ZR-75-1. Digoxin consistently exerted its cytotoxicity to these four cell lines with various range of concentration. However, the proliferation of ZR-75-1 cells was the only cell lines induced by digoxin and the others were dramatically suppressed by digoxin. The responsiveness of SRSF3 to digoxin might be involved with cell-type differences. In summary, we combined a cohort study for digoxin treatment for HF patients with a cell -based strategy that addresses the translation issue, which revealed the complexity of personalized medicine.

28496419|t|Comparison and Outcome Analysis of Patients with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Triggered by Emotional Stress or Physical Stress
28496419|a|Background: Previous studies revealed that takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) is triggered by physical and emotional stresses. This study was performed to determine the short- and long-term prognostic impact of emotional- and physical stress associated with TTC. Methods and results: Our institutional database constituted a collective of 84 patients diagnosed with TTC between 2003 and 2015. The patients were divided into two groups as per the presence of emotional stress (n = 24, 21%) or physical stress (n = 60, 52.6%). The endpoint was a composite of in-hospital events (thromboembolic events and life-threatening arrhythmias), myocardial infarction, all- cause of mortality, re-hospitalization due to heart failure, stroke, and recurrence of TTC. A Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated a significantly lower event-free survival rate over a mean follow-up of 5 years in the emotional group than the physical stress group (log-rank, p < 0.01). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed only emotional stress (HR 0.4, 95% CI: 0.2-0.9, p < 0.05) as a negative independent predictor of the primary endpoint. Conclusion: Rates of in-hospital events and short- as well as long-term events were significantly lower in TTC patients suffering from emotional stress as compared to patients with physical stress.

28497887|t|Surviving moment to moment: The experience of living in a state of ambivalence for those with recurrent suicide attempts
28497887|a|This qualitative study aimed to capture the experience of living in the ambivalent space between life and death for adults with recurrent suicide attempts (RSA). It sought to expand upon an earlier study that explored the processes involved in transitioning away from RSA among adults, which revealed that occupying this ambivalent space is a crucial part of this process. Interpretive phenomenological analysis (IPA) was used. This methodology was designed to explore the lived experiences and meaning making and enabled interpretation of the multidimensional subjective experiences of RSA participants. In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight adult women with a history of RSA who had participated in a therapeutic intervention at the research site (Skills for Safer Living: A Psychosocial / Psychoeducational Intervention for People with Recurrent Suicide Attempts [SfSL / PISA]). The six stages of IPA were followed to analyse the interview data. Analysis revealed the superordinate theme, ' surviving moment to moment ', which refers to a precarious state of making decisions about one's life and destiny on a moment -to- moment basis without clear commitment to either life or death. Two subordinate themes were identified: ' deciding not to die in the moment ' when the participants were more invested in dying than living and ' deciding to live in the moment ' when they were more invested in living than dying. The study illuminated the complex process of making decisions about ones' destiny on a moment -to- moment basis. It revealed the torment experienced when occupying this state, while paradoxically, also revealing how indecision about life and death provided a lifeline opportunity for those with RSA. Clinicians who recognize the subtle distinctions associated with this in-between state can tailor their interventions accordingly. Surviving moment to moment is characterized by a state of emotional flux and uncertainty about one's destiny, where the person has not fully committed to either life or death. Within this state, there are two interlinked subprocesses, whereby the person is leaning more towards death or life. A critical feature in working with this client group is to recognize their ambiguity and the fragility and temporality of their decisions about their destiny. The practitioner has an opportunity to be a catalyst in the momentum towards life by demonstrating understanding of this survival struggle and tailoring intervention to fit with the nuanced processes within this state.

28500997|t|Does a policy of earlier induction affect labour outcomes in women induced for postmaturity? A retrospective analysis in a tertiary hospital in the North of England
28500997|a|to investigate whether a change in the management of postmature pregnancy to earlier induction affects the length of labour and the induction process. Secondly, to assess the feasibility of the research process to inform a future larger study. a change in management of postmature pregnancy in an NHS hospital in October 2013, from induction at 42 weeks gestation to induction between 41-42 weeks, provided an opportunity to conduct a retrospective analysis. Pre-existing data from the maternity database and casenotes were collected and primary outcomes analysed using the Mann-Whitney test and the Hodges-Lehman confidence interval for differences in medians. a large city based tertiary referral hospital in the North of England. 125 women induced before the change in policy were compared with 309 women induced after the change. primary outcomes were length of 1st and 2nd stage of labour, overall length of labour, length of induction to established labour and length of induction to birth. the median overall length of labour for women induced at 42 weeks was 6.5 hours, while for women induced at 41-42 weeks this was 5.2 hours. The difference was not statistically significant (p=0.15, 95% CI for median difference -0.27 to 1.93 hours) with a small effect size (Pearson's r=-0.08). The median length of induction to birth was 13.6 hours for women induced at 42 weeks and 16.5 hours for women induced at 41-42 weeks. This difference was also not statistically significant (p=0.14, 95% CI for median difference -7.25 to 1.20 hours) with a small effect size (Pearson's r=-0.13). This study demonstrated no statistically significant difference s in length of labour and induction following a change in the management of postmature pregnancy to earlier induction. A large study is needed to establish definitively the effects of earlier induction on labour outcomes.

28501006|t|Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry -based quantitative proteomics analysis reveals chondroprotective effects of astragaloside IV in interleukin-1β - induced SW1353 chondrocyte-like cells
28501006|a|Chondrocyte apoptosis played a key role on the progression of Osteoarthritis (OA). Safe and effective drugs are urgently needed for the treatment of OA. Previous study reported that Astragaloside IV (ASG-IV) had exerted a protective effect against articular cartilage degeneration by promoting rapid proliferation of chondrocyte. Therefore, the aim of our study is to explore the effects and mechanisms of ASG-IV in chondrocyte apoptosis. Isobaric Tags For Relative And Absolute Quantitation (iTRAQ)-based quantitative proteomics was used to quantitatively detect and map proteins in SW1353 chondrocyte-like cells pre-treated with ASG-IV or interleukin-1β (IL-1β) or ASG-IV + IL-1β. The iTRAQ-labeled peptides were fractionated by high-accuracy liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Cell apoptosis and differentially expressed proteins was detected by flow cytometry (FCM), quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and western blotting, respectively. The apoptosis of the IL-1β - induced SW1353 cells treated with ASG-IV was greatly inhibited. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that gamma actin 1 (ACTG1) and Yes Associated Protein 1 (YAP1), participating in the Hippo signaling pathway and Vitronectin (VTN) and Collagen Type I Alpha 1 Chain (COL1A1), involving in the extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction signaling pathway, were all significantly up-regulated in the IL-1β - induced SW1353 cells after treatment with ASG-IV. The qRT-PCR and Western blotting results confirmed the up-regulation of these four genes. ASG-IV played a positive role in human osteoarthritic chondrocyte apoptosis, possibly through modulation of the Hippo signaling pathway by up-regulating YAP1 and ACTG1 expression, and also by up-regulating VTN and COL1A1, which are involved in the ECM-receptor interaction pathway. Taken together, all the results suggested that ASG-IV had a novel therapeutic potential for the treatment of OA.

28501764|t|Open-label, multicentre safety study of vemurafenib in 3219 patients with BRAF(V600) mutation - positive metastatic melanoma: 2-year follow-up data and long-term responders' analysis
28501764|a|The orally available BRAF kinase inhibitor vemurafenib is an effective and tolerable treatment option for patients with metastatic melanoma harbouring BRAF(V600) mutations. We assessed the safety of vemurafenib in a large population of patients with few alternative treatment options; we report updated 2-year safety. This was an open-label, multicentre study of vemurafenib (960 mg bid) in patients with previously treated or untreated BRAF mutation - positive metastatic melanoma (cobas(®) 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test). The primary end-point was safety; efficacy end-points were secondary. An exploratory analysis was performed to assess safety outcomes in patients with long duration of response (DOR) (≥12 or ≥24 months). After a median follow-up of 32.2 months (95% CI, 31.1-33.2 months), 3079/3219 patients (96%) had discontinued treatment. Adverse events (AEs) were largely consistent with previous reports; the most common all-grade treatment -related AEs were arthralgia (37%), alopecia (25%) and hyperkeratosis (23%); the most common grade 3/4 treatment -related AEs were squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (8%) and keratoacanthoma (8%). In the exploratory analysis, patients with DOR ≥12 months (n = 287) or ≥24 months (n = 133) were more likely to experience grade 3/4 AEs than the overall population. No new specific safety signals were observed with longer vemurafenib exposure. After 2 years' follow-up, safety was maintained in this large group of patients with BRAF(V600) mutation - positive metastatic melanoma who are more representative of routine clinical practice than typical clinical trial populations. These data suggest that long-term vemurafenib treatment is effective and tolerable without the development of new safety signals.

28502812|t|Collecting and Reporting Safety Data and Monitoring Trial Conduct In Pragmatic Trials
28502812|a|Pragmatic trials offer the opportunity to obtain real-life data on the relative effectiveness and safety of a treatment before or after market authorisation. This is the penultimate paper in a series of eight, describing the impact of design choices on the practical implementation of pragmatic trials. This paper focuses on the practical challenges of collecting and reporting safety data and of monitoring trial conduct while maintaining routine clinical care practice. Current ICH guidance recommends that, all serious adverse events (SAEs) and all drug -related events must be reported in an interventional trial. In line with current guidance, we propose a risk based approach to the collection of non - drug related non-serious AEs, and even serious events not related to treatment based on the risk profile of the medicine /class in the patient population of interest. Different options available to support the collection and reporting of safety data whilst minimizing study -related follow-up visits are discussed. A risk -based approach to monitoring trial conduct is also discussed, highlighting the difference in the balance of risks likely to occur in a pragmatic trial compared to traditional clinical trials, and the careful consideration that must be given to the mitigation and management of these risks in order to maintain routine care.

28503431|t|A pilot study of intraocular lens explantation in 69 eyes in Chinese patients
28503431|a|To study the effects of intraocular lens (IOL) explantation and demographic characteristics. Retrospective non-comparative case series. Clinical data recorded from patient charts included the following: demographic, preoperative and postoperative characteristics; complications; surgical methods, and changes in visual acuity. A total of 69 eyes in 67 Chinese patients who received IOL explants were studied. The patients ' mean age at the time of explantation was 46.1 years old [SD 22.5 (6-85)], and 37 patients were female (55.2%). Regarding employment, 47.8% were farmers, 23.9% were retired, 16.4% were students, 4.5% were unemployed, 3% were workers, and 4.5% were other (including staff members, teachers and officers). The main reasons for explantation were dislocation / decentration in 41 cases (59.4%) and retinal detachment in 10 cases (14.5%). The third most prevalent cause was incorrect lens power in 7 eyes (10.1%). The remaining reasons were endophthalmitis in 6 cases (8.7%), posterior capsular opacity in 3 eyes (4.3%), and impacting retinal surgery operation in 2 cases (2.9%). The main comorbidities were high myopia in 18 eyes (26.1%), trauma in 8 eyes (11.6%), retinal detachment in 6 eyes (8.7%), congenital cataracts in 8 eyes (11.6%), and Marfan's syndrome in 2 eyes (2.9%). The mean time from implantation to explantation was 4.0y [SD 4.2 (0.005-15)]. Treatment after explantation included posterior chamber IOL implantation in 44 eyes (63.8%) and aphakia in 25 eyes (36.2%). After surgery, the best corrected visual ability (BCVA) was improved in 50 cases (72.5%), including 28 patients (40.6%) in whom visual ability was improved by more than two lines. Dislocation / decentration is the main cause for explantation, and high myopia is a main risk factor. Posterior chamber IOL implantation remains the most elected treatment after explantation.

28505472|t|Improvement of older - person - specific QOL after hearing aid fitting and its relation to social interaction
28505472|a|This study aimed to investigate whether hearing aids use is associated with improvement of older - person - specific QOL and whether social interactions modify the association. The WHOQOL-OLD questionnaire was answered by 105 older adults aged 60 to 90 years who were newly fitted hearing aids on the day of fitting and at 2 - 6 months afterward. The associations between the daily hours of hearing aid usage and social relations with changes in the WHOQOL-OLD total score after hearing aids fitting were estimated adjusting for possible confounders. Older persons with hearing loss experienced significant increases in WHOQOL-OLD total score after hearing aid fitting. Regular use of hearing aid was associated with a greater increase in the total score. The combined categorical variable of social relations and hearing aid usage revealed no separate effects of these two variables, but a combined effect; only those with frequent social interactions who used their hearing aid regularly had a significantly greater increase in WHOQOL-OLD total score. This study's findings indicate that hearing aid fitting may be associated with a subsequent improvement in older - person - specific QOL by improvements in hearing due to the hearing aid, and possibly enhanced communication opportunities.

28506958|t|Enhancing Comparative Effectiveness Research With Automated Pediatric Pneumonia Detection in a Multi-Institutional Clinical Repository: A PHIS + Pilot Study
28506958|a|Community-acquired pneumonia is a leading cause of pediatric morbidity. Administrative data are often used to conduct comparative effectiveness research (CER) with sufficient sample sizes to enhance detection of important outcomes. However, such studies are prone to misclassification errors because of the variable accuracy of discharge diagnosis codes. The aim of this study was to develop an automated, scalable, and accurate method to determine the presence or absence of pneumonia in children using chest imaging reports. The multi-institutional PHIS + clinical repository was developed to support pediatric CER by expanding an administrative database of children's hospitals with detailed clinical data. To develop a scalable approach to find patients with bacterial pneumonia more accurately, we developed a Natural Language Processing (NLP) application to extract relevant information from chest diagnostic imaging reports. Domain experts established a reference standard by manually annotating 282 reports to train and then test the NLP application. Findings of pleural effusion, pulmonary infiltrate, and pneumonia were automatically extracted from the reports and then used to automatically classify whether a report was consistent with bacterial pneumonia. Compared with the annotated diagnostic imaging reports reference standard, the most accurate implementation of machine learning algorithms in our NLP application allowed extracting relevant findings with a sensitivity of .939 and a positive predictive value of .925. It allowed classifying reports with a sensitivity of .71, a positive predictive value of .86, and a specificity of .962. When compared with each of the domain experts manually annotating these reports, the NLP application allowed for significantly higher sensitivity (.71 vs .527) and similar positive predictive value and specificity. NLP -based pneumonia information extraction of pediatric diagnostic imaging reports performed better than domain experts in this pilot study. NLP is an efficient method to extract information from a large collection of imaging reports to facilitate CER.

28507202|t|Determination of volatile organic compounds exhaled by cell lines derived from hematological malignancies
28507202|a|Background: The gas human exhaled contains many volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which is related to the health status of body. Analysis of VOCs has been proposed as a noninvasive diagnostic tool for certain cancers. Detailed research on the VOCs in gas exhaled by cell can characterize cell type specific metabolites and may be helpful to detect the cancer markers in clinical practice. Methods: Solid phase microextraction - gas chromatography - mass spectrometry was used to detect VOCs in the headspace of tissue culture flask in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cell line JEKO and acute mononuclear leukemia cell line SHI-1, to elaborate the characteristic gaseous biomarkers of hematological malignancies. While macrophage cells and lymphocytic cells were acted as control. The blank group was only the RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum that without cells. Results: Comparing to control group, the concentration of dimethyl sulphide, 2,4-dimethyl-heptane, methylbenzene, o-xylene, dodecane and 1,3-ditert-butylbenzene in JEKO cells were relatively higher, while the concentration of ethanol, hexanal and benzaldehyde was lower. In SHI-1 cells, the levels of 2,4-dimethyl-heptane, benzene, 4-methyldecane, chloroform, 3,7-dimethyl dodecane and hexadecane were significantly elevated, but the levels of hexanol and cyclohexanol were distinctly reduced. Conclusions: This pilot study revealed that the malignant hematological cells could change the components of VOCs in the cell culture flask in a cell type specific pattern. The traits of VOCs in our setting offered new strategy for hematological malignancies tracing, and would act as potential biomarkers in diagnosis of malignant hematological diseases.

28511890|t|Intratympanic steroid delivery by an indwelling catheter in refractory severe sudden sensorineural hearing loss
28511890|a|Many studies over the last decade showed favorable outcomes with intratympanic (IT) steroid treatment, alone as salvage treatment or in combination with conventional systemic therapy (ST). However, in severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss resistant to ST, the optimal infusion mode, the type and concentration of the solution, the preferable drug, its total amount, and the duration and fractionation of the treatment are still debated. Aim of the study was to investigate the feasibility and the outcomes of a direct and constant IT delivery of dexamethasone (DEX) by means of a new indwelling catheter. A prospective case-control study in a tertiary referral university hospital. Ninety-nine subjects treated with ST only and 28 with additional IT DEX have been included in the study. A 4 Fr catheter inserted in a sub-annular fashion with a minimal postero-inferior tympanotomy through and endocanalar approach under local anesthesia. DEX 4mg/ml delivered daily, up to 7 days. Daily bone and air-conducted pure tone and speech audiometry were performed with a follow-up at 1, 3, 6 months after treatment. Twenty-one out of 28 patients (75%) refractory to ST gained on average 24.0dB±20.5dB HL after IT - DEX, compared to 35.4% (average 6.7dB±16.6dB HL) of those receiving only medical ST (p<0.001). No significant side effects were noted. In severe to profound sudden deafness refractory to conventional ST, the daily perfusion of 4mg/ml DEX through an intratympanic catheter is an easy, well accepted procedure that enables patients to receive a drug in the middle ear in a repeatable or sustained form, with minimal discomfort and a partial rescue (67.86%) and a speech recognition gain of 39%.

28511906|t|Design, synthesis and anti-tumor activity study of novel histone deacetylase inhibitors containing isatin -based caps and o-phenylenediamine -based zinc binding groups
28511906|a|As a hot topic of epigenetic studies, histone deacetylases (HDACs) are related to lots of diseases, especially cancer. Further researches indicated that different HDAC isoforms played various roles in a wide range of tumor types. Herein a novel series of HDAC inhibitors with isatin -based caps and o-phenylenediamine -based zinc binding groups have been designed and synthesized through scaffold hopping strategy. Among these compounds, the most potent compound 9n exhibited similar if not better HDAC inhibition and antiproliferative activities against multiple tumor cell lines compared with the positive control entinostat (MS-275). Additionally, compared with MS-275 (IC50 values for HDAC1, 2 and 3 were 0.163, 0.396 and 0.605µM, respectively), compound 9n with IC50 values of 0.032, 0.256 and 0.311µM for HDAC1, 2 and 3 respectively, showed a moderate HDAC1 selectivity.

28514486|t|Efficacy of 42 Pharmacologic Cotreatment Strategies Added to Antipsychotic Monotherapy in Schizophrenia: Systematic Overview and Quality Appraisal of the Meta-analytic Evidence
28514486|a|Limited treatment responses in schizophrenia prompted the testing of combining an antipsychotic drug treatment with a second psychotropic medication. A comprehensive evaluation of the efficacy of multiple medication combinations is missing. To summarize and compare the meta-analytically determined efficacy of pharmacologic combination strategies of antipsychotic drugs in adults with schizophrenia. Systematic search of PubMed and PsycInfo until May 13, 2016. Meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials comparing the efficacy of antipsychotic drugs combined with other antipsychotic or nonantipsychotic medications vs placebos or antipsychotic monotherapy among adults with schizophrenia. Independent reviewers extracted the data and assessed the quality of the methods of the included meta-analyses using A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR), adding 6 new items to rate their quality. Effect sizes, expressed as standardized mean difference /Hedges g or risk ratio, were compared separately for combinations with any antipsychotic drug and for combinations with clozapine. The primary outcome was total symptom reduction. Secondary outcomes included positive and negative symptoms, treatment recommendations by authors, study-defined inefficacies, cognitive and depressive symptoms, discontinuation of treatment because of any cause, and inefficacies or intolerabilities. Of 3397 publications, 29 meta-analyses testing 42 combination strategies in 381 individual trials and among 19 833 participants were included. For total symptom reductions, 32 strategies that augmented any antipsychotic drug and 5 strategies that augmented clozapine were examined. Fourteen combination treatments outperformed controls (standard mean difference /Hedges g, -1.27 [95% CI, -2.35 to -0.19] to -0.23 [95% CI, -0.44 to -0.02]; P = .05). No combination strategies with clozapine outperformed controls. The quality of the methods of the meta-analyses was generally high (mean score, 9 of a maximum score of 11) but the quality of the meta-analyzed studies was low (mean score, 2.8 of a maximum score of 8). Treatment recommendations correlated with the effect size (correlation coefficient, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.35-0.10; P < .001), yet effect sizes were inversely correlated with study quality (correlation coefficient, -0.06; 95% CI, 0.01 to -0.12; P = .02). Meta-analyses of 21 interventions fully or partially recommended their use, with recommendations being positively correlated with the effect sizes of the pooled intervention. However, the effect sizes were inversely correlated with meta-analyzed study quality, reducing confidence in these recommendations. Higher - quality trials and patient -based meta-analyses are needed to determine whether subpopulations might benefit from combination treatment, as no single strategy can be recommended for patients with schizophrenia based on the current meta-analytic literature.

28515448|t|Involvement Of Vascular Aldosterone Synthase In Phosphate - Induced Osteogenic Transformation Of Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells
28515448|a|Vascular calcification resulting from hyperphosphatemia is a major determinant of mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Vascular calcification is driven by aldosterone -sensitive osteogenic transformation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). We show that even in absence of exogenous aldosterone, silencing and pharmacological inhibition (spironolactone, eplerenone) of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) ameliorated phosphate - induced osteo- / chondrogenic transformation of primary human aortic smooth muscle cells (HAoSMCs). High phosphate concentrations up-regulated aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) expression in HAoSMCs. Silencing and deficiency of CYP11B2 in VSMCs ameliorated phosphate - induced osteogenic reprogramming and calcification. Phosphate treatment was followed by nuclear export of APEX1, a CYP11B2 transcriptional repressor. APEX1 silencing up-regulated CYP11B2 expression and stimulated osteo- / chondrogenic transformation. APEX1 overexpression blunted the phosphate - induced osteo- / chondrogenic transformation and calcification of HAoSMCs. Cyp11b2 expression was higher in aortic tissue of hyperphosphatemic klotho-hypomorphic (kl/kl) mice than in wild-type mice. In adrenalectomized kl/kl mice, spironolactone treatment still significantly ameliorated aortic osteoinductive reprogramming. Our findings suggest that VSMCs express aldosterone synthase, which is up-regulated by phosphate - induced disruption of APEX1 -dependent gene suppression. Vascular CYP11B2 may contribute to stimulation of VSMCs osteo- / chondrogenic transformation during hyperphosphatemia.

28516341|t|Fairness: the hidden challenge for competency-based postgraduate medical education programs
28516341|a|Competency-based medical education systems allow institutions to individualize teaching practices to meet the needs of diverse learners. Yet, the focus on continuous improvement and individualization of curricula does not exempt programs from treating learners in a fair manner. When learners fail to meet key competencies and are placed on probation or dismissed from training programs, issues of fairness may form the basis of their legal claims. In a literature search, we found no in-depth examination of fairness. In this paper, we utilize a systems lens to examine fairness within postgraduate medical education contexts, focusing on educational opportunities, assessment practices, decision-making processes, fairness from a legal standpoint, and fairness in the context of the learning environment. While we provide examples of fairness issues within US training programs, concerns regarding fairness are relevant in any medical education system which utilizes a competency-based education framework. Assessment oversight committees and annual programmatic evaluations, while recommended, will not guarantee fairness within postgraduate medical education programs, but they can provide a window into 'hidden' threats to fairness, as everything from training experiences to assessment practices may be examined by these committees. One of the first steps programs can take is to recognize that threats to fairness may exist in any educational program, including their own, and begin conversations about how to address these issues.

28516841|t|Us3 and Us9 proteins contribute to the stromal invasion of bovine herpesvirus 1 in the respiratory mucosa
28516841|a|Bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1) infection may lead to conjunctivitis, upper respiratory tract problems, pneumonia, genital disorders and abortion. BHV-1 is able to spread quickly in a plaque -wise manner and invade by breaching the basement membrane (BM) barrier in the respiratory mucosa. BHV-1 Us3, a serine/threonine kinase, induces a dramatic cytoskeletal reorganization and BHV-1 Us9, a tail-anchored membrane protein, is required for axonal transport of viruses in neurons. In this study, we investigated the role of Us3 and Us9 during BHV-1 infection in the respiratory mucosa. First, we constructed and characterized BHV-1 Us3 null, Us9 null and revertant viruses. Then, we analysed the viral replication and plaque size (latitude) in Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells and the respiratory mucosa as well as viral penetration depth underneath the BM of the respiratory mucosa when inoculated with these recombinant viruses. Knockout of Us3 resulted in a 1 log10 reduction in viral titre and plaque size (latitude) in MDBK cells and the trachea mucosa. There were no defects in the cell-to-cell spread observed for BHV-1 Us9 null virus. Both BHV-1 Us3 null and Us9 null viruses showed a significant reduction of plaque penetration underneath the BM; however, penetration was not completely inhibited. In conclusion, the current findings demonstrated that Us3 and Us9 play an important role in the invasion of BHV-1 through the BM of the respiratory mucosa, which shows the way forward for research -based attenuation of viruses in order to make safer and better - performing vaccines.

28520661|t|Traumatic Brain Injury and Depression in a Community - Based Sample: A Cohort Study Across the Adult Life Span
28520661|a|To determine whether self-reported traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) are associated with " cases " of clinically significant depression in the general community. To examine interactions between variables previously linked to depression after a TBI. Population -based community study (Canberra and Queanbeyan, Australia). Three age cohorts: young, middle-aged, and older adults (aged 20-24, 40-44, and 60-64 years at baseline) randomly selected from the electoral roll and followed across 3 waves (4 years apart). A total of 7397, 6621, and 6042 people provided their TBI history in waves 1 to 3. Lifetime (TBIlifetime: sustained at any time since birth), recent (TBIrecent: in the preceding 4 years), and multiple (TBImultiple: more than 1) TBIs, current depression, and known risk factors for depression (age, sex, marital / employment status, prior history of depression, medical conditions, recent life events, alcohol consumption, social support, physical activity). Generalized estimating equations demonstrated a significant association between sustaining a TBI and experiencing clinically significant depression (cases), even after controlling for multiple demographic and health / lifestyle factors. There is an enduring association between depression and TBI, suggesting that, following a TBI, individuals should be monitored and supported to optimize their long-term psychological health.

28521254|t|CS - PEG decorated PLGA nano-prototype for delivery of bioactive compounds: A novel approach for induction of apoptosis in HepG2 cell line
28521254|a|Polymer - based nanoparticles are used as vectors for cancer drug delivery. The bioactive compounds (quercetin, ellagic acid and gallic acid) are well known to be not only antioxidants but also chemopreventive candidates against various types of cancers. To circumvent the low bioavailability and the short half-life time obstacles, we hypothesized a novel PLGA nano-platform functionalized with CS and PEG to encapsulate these phytochemicals. This encapsulation will protect the compounds from the phagocytic uptake and deliver PLGA-CS-PEG nano-prototype with high biodegradability and biosafety. Three consequent types of PLGA-based nanocomposites were prepared and characterized. Furthermore, we investigated the newly synthesized nano-formulations against human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) and colorectal cancer (HCT 116) cell lines using cell growth inhibition assays, followed by apoptosis and necrosis assays using flow cytometry to detect the underlying mechanism of HepG2 cell death. Through Malvern Zeta Sizer, we recorded that the average diameters of the nano-prototypes ranged from 150 to 300nm. The cytotoxic activity of quercetin, ellagic acid, and gallic acid - encapsulated PLGA, PLGA-CS, and PLGA-CS-PEG nano-prototypes it has been found that they reduce the IC50s of the HepG2 cells values by 2.2, 2.9, 2.8- folds, 1, 1.5, 2.7- folds, and 0.9, 0.7, 1.5- folds, respectively. Mechanistically, the nano-platforms of quercetin seem to be dependent on both apoptosis and necrosis, while those of ellagic acid and gallic acid are mainly dependent on apoptosis. CS - PEG -blended PLGA nano-delivery system of quercetin, ellagic acid and gallic acid can potentiate apoptosis-mediated cell death in HepG2 cell line.

28521617|t|Fingerprint -based background checks for personal care workers: Stakeholder views of policy criteria
28521617|a|Decision makers face difficult choices when tasked with identifying and implementing appropriate mechanisms for protecting the elderly and other vulnerable adults from abuse. A pilot project involving fingerprint -based criminal history background checks for personal care workers in Michigan has supplied an opportunity to examine one such mechanism. In conjunction with the pilot project, we have conducted a stakeholder analysis with the aim of informing decision makers about stakeholder perceptions of standard policy criteria like effectiveness, efficiency, and equity. We employed focus groups and a web-based survey to collect data from stakeholders. While stakeholders generally see fingerprint -based background checks for personal care workers as potentially effective and as a net benefit, they also point to a variety of contingencies. They also recognize difficulties and constraints for government involvement. This preliminary analysis provides solid foundational information for decision makers and for more extensive benefit-cost analysis.

28523090|t|Penetrating Craniomaxillofacial Injury Caused by a Pneumatic Nail Gun
28523090|a|Craniomaxillofacial injuries can be complex, requiring a multidisciplinary approach. The primary survey is always the first step in trauma management prior to proceeding with further evaluation and treatment. A 26- year -old man presented with a penetrating nail gun injury through the oral and nasal cavities. He did not present in extremis but required elective endotracheal intubation for intraoperative assessment and treatment. Airway management was enhanced by the use of lingual nerve and inferior alveolar nerve blocks via the Vazirani-Akinosi technique to maintain spontaneous respiration while the tongue was distracted from the palate. The nail was removed and rapid sequence induction initiated for orotracheal intubation. Local nerve blocks can be an effective tool in the armamentarium of the craniomaxillofacial trauma surgeon in managing blunt and penetrating injuries. We demonstrate its utility in airway management when a penetrating foreign body in the upper airway precludes orotracheal or nasotracheal intubation.

28523722|t|Design of a candidate vibrational signal for mating disruption against the glassy-winged sharpshooter, Homalodisca vitripennis
28523722|a|The glassy-winged sharpshooter (GWSS), Homalodisca vitripennis, is an important pest of grapevines due to its ability to transmit Xylella fastidiosa, the causal agent of Pierce's disease. GWSS mating communication is based on vibrational signals; therefore, vibrational mating disruption could be an alternative to insecticides for suppression of GWSS population. Our objectives were to identify spectral features of female signal that elicit male signaling, design disruptive signals able to alter male perception and acceptance of a female, and determine the signal intensity required for future field applications. Results showed that male responses to playback of modified female signals were significantly reduced by 60-75%when part of the female signal spectral components above or below 400 Hz were deleted. Playback bioassays showed that transmission of an 80 Hz pure frequency tone to plants completely suppressed male signaling to female signal playback, even if the disruptive signal amplitude was 10 dB lower than the female signal playback. Although the mechanism underlying cessation of male signaling activity in the presence of disruption is not yet understood, results suggest that an 80 Hz vibrational signal should be tested in laboratory and field experiments to assess its efficacy in disrupting mating of GWSS.

28526000|t|Barriers and facilitators to smoking cessation in a cancer context: A qualitative study of patient, family and professional views
28526000|a|Continued smoking after cancer adversely affects quality of life and survival, but one fifth of cancer survivors still smoke. Despite its demands, cancer presents an opportunity for positive behaviour change. Smoking often occurs in social groups, therefore interventions which target families and individuals may be more successful. This qualitative study explored patients, family members and health professionals ' views and experiences of smoking and smoking cessation after cancer, in order to inform future interventions. In-depth qualitative interviews (n = 67) with 29 patients, 14 family members and 24 health professionals. Data were analysed using the 'Framework' method. Few patient s and family members had used National Health Service (NHS) smoking cessation services and more than half still smoked. Most recalled little ' smoking -related' discussion with clinicians but were receptive to talking openly. Clinicians revealed several barriers to discussion. Participants ' continued smoking was explained by the stress of diagnosis; desire to maintain personal control; and lack of connection between smoking, cancer and health. A range of barriers to smoking cessation exist for patients and family members. These are insufficiently assessed and considered by clinicians. Interventions must be more effectively integrated into routine practice.

28526485|t|Improving the Sexual Health of Young People With Mobility Impairments: Challenges and Recommendations
28526485|a|This mixed-method study (a) describes challenges to providing sexual health services to youth with mobility impairments from the perspective of health care providers and experts and (b) describes and compares sexual health -related experiences of youth with mobility impairments. Secondary data analysis of My Path, a study focused on the transition to adulthood for youth with mobility impairments. Using an exploratory sequential design, qualitative data (n = 10) were analyzed using systematic content analysis followed by quantitative analysis of survey data (N = 337). Challenges included not talking about sex, managing sexual development, adaptation and instruction, parent roles, and safety. Survey data showed that youth with mobility impairments are diverse in their experiences with sexual behavior and sources of sexual health information. Although connected with primary care providers, few received information about sexual health. Interventions to improve youths ' well-being should include comprehensive care and education that promotes and supports healthy sexual development.

28526692|t|Understanding the interrelationship between the synthesis of urea and gluconeogenesis by formulating an overall balanced equation
28526692|a|It is well known that a strong metabolic interrelationship exists between ureagenesis and gluconeogenesis. In this paper, we present a detailed, overall equation, describing a possible metabolic link between ureagenesis and gluconeogenesis. We adopted a guided approach in which we strongly suggest that students, when faced with the problem of obtaining the overall equation of a metabolic pathway, carefully account for all atoms and charges of the single reactions, as well as the cellular localizations of the substrates, and the related transport systems. If this suggestion is always taken into account, a balanced, overall equation of a metabolic pathway will be obtained, which strongly facilitates the discussion of its physiological role. Unfortunately, textbooks often report unbalanced overall equations of metabolic pathways, including ureagenesis and gluconeogenesis. Most likely the reason is that metabolism and enzymology have been neglected for about three decades, owing to the remarkable advances of molecular biology and molecular genetics. In this paper, we strongly suggest that students, when faced with the problem of obtaining the overall reaction of a metabolic pathway, carefully control if the single reactions are properly balanced for atoms and charges. Following this suggestion, we were able to obtain an overall equation describing the metabolic interrelationship between ureagenesis and gluconeogenesis, in which urea and glucose are the final products. The aim is to better rationalize this topic and to convince students and teachers that metabolism is an important and rewarding chapter of human physiology.

28526816|t|Delineation of B-cell Epitopes of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi Hemolysin E: Potential antibody therapeutic target
28526816|a|Hemolysin E (HlyE) is an immunogenic novel pore -forming toxin involved in the pathogenesis of typhoid fever. Thus, mapping of B-cell epitopes of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) is critical to identify key immunogenic regions of HlyE. A random 20-mer peptide library was used for biopanning with enriched anti-HlyE polyclonal antibodies from typhoid patient sera. Bioinformatic tools were used to refine, analyze and map the enriched peptide sequences against the protein to identify the epitopes. The analysis identified both linear and conformational epitopes on the HlyE protein. The predicted linear GAAAGIVAG and conformational epitope PYSQESVLSADSQNQK were further validated against the pooled sera. The identified epitopes were then used to isolate epitope specific monoclonal antibodies by antibody phage display. Monoclonal scFv antibodies were enriched for both linear and conformational epitopes. Molecular docking was performed to elucidate the antigen-antibody interaction of the monoclonal antibodies against the epitopes on the HlyE monomer and oligomer structure. An in-depth view of the mechanistic and positional characteristics of the antibodies and epitope for HlyE was successfully accomplished by a combination of phage display and bioinformatic analysis. The predicted function and structure of the antibodies highlights the possibility of utilizing the antibodies as neutralizing agents for typhoid fever.

28532107|t|Comparison of electrospun and solvent cast polylactic acid (PLA)/ poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) inserts as potential ocular drug delivery vehicles
28532107|a|The purpose of this work was to develop, characterize and compare electrospun nanofiber inserts (ENIs) and solvent cast polymeric inserts (SCIs) for ocular drug delivery. ENI and SCI of 1%, 5% and 10% w/w dexamethasone were fabricated using a blend of poly-lactic acid (PLA) and poly-vinyl alcohol (PVA). Inserts were characterized for morphology, thickness, pH, drug content, drug crystallinity, in vitro drug release, sterility, dimethylformamide (DMF) and chloroform content, and cytotoxicity. The thickness of 1%, 5%, and 10% dexamethasone -loaded ENIs were found to be 50μm, 62.5μm, and 93.3μm, respectively, with good folding endurance. SCIs were brittle, with thickness values >200μm. Drug release rates from 1%, 5% and 10% ENIs were found to be 0.62μg/h, 1.46μg/h, and 2.30μg/h, respectively, while those from SCIs were erratic. DMF content in ENIs and SCIs were 0.007% w/w and 0.123% w/w, respectively, while chloroform was not detected. No cytotoxicity was observed from ENIs in cultured bovine corneal endothelial cells for up to 24h. We conclude that ENIs are better than SCIs and could be utilized as a potential delivery system for treating anterior segment ocular diseases.

28532323|t|Quantitative regulation of histone variant H2A.Z during cell cycle by ubiquitin proteasome system and SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligases
28532323|a|Quantitative control of histones and histone variants during cell cycle is relevant to their epigenetic functions. We found that the level of yeast histone variant H2A.Z in the G2/M-phase is actively kept low by the ubiquitin proteasome system and SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligases. Overexpression of H2A.Z induced defects in mitotic progression, suggesting functional importance of this quantitative control.

28532624|t|Tyrphostin AG-related compounds attenuate H2O2 - induced TRPM2 - dependent and - independent cellular responses
28532624|a|TRPM2 is a Ca(2+)-permeable channel that is activated by H2O2. TRPM2 -mediated Ca(2+) signaling has been implicated in the aggravation of inflammatory diseases. Therefore, the development of TRPM2 inhibitors to prevent the aggravation of these diseases is expected. We recently reported that some Tyrphostin AG-related compounds inhibited the H2O2 - induced activation of TRPM2 by scavenging the intracellular hydroxyl radical. In the present study, we examined the effects of AG-related compounds on H2O2 - induced cellular responses in human monocytic U937 cells, which functionally express TRPM2. The effects of AG-related compounds on H2O2 - induced changes in intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation, and CXCL8 secretion were assessed using U937 cells. Ca(2+) influxes via TRPM2 in response to H2O2 were blocked by AG-related compounds. AG-related compounds also inhibited the H2O2 - induced activation of ERK, and subsequent secretion of CXCL8 mediated by TRPM2 - dependent and - independent mechanisms. Our results show that AG-related compounds inhibit H2O2 - induced CXCL8 secretion following ERK activation, which is mediated by TRPM2 - dependent and - independent mechanisms in U937 cells. We previously reported that AG-related compounds blocked H2O2 - induced TRPM2 activation by scavenging the hydroxyl radical. The inhibitory effects of AG-related compounds on TRPM2 - independent responses may be due to scavenging of the hydroxyl radical.

28532629|t|Shared decision making in the UK: Moving towards wider uptake
28532629|a|Shared decision making (SDM) is firmly on the policy agenda in the UK and a recent legal ruling has confirmed its importance. Policymakers, ethicists, professional regulators and societies, patient organisations and now the courts are committed to ensuring that SDM becomes the norm throughout the NHS, but an unfavourable economic climate makes this especially challenging. Considerable progress has been made over the last few years, with new learning from demonstration sites, various initiatives in capacity building and training, wider availability of patient decision aids, and important leadership initiatives. Enthusiasm for this way of working is growing among clinicians, patients and managers, but it could be undermined if SDM comes to be seen primarily as a means of cost control.

28536031|t|Lactate induces osteoblast differentiation by stabilization of HIF1α
28536031|a|Aerobic glycolysis is involved in osteoblast differentiation induced by Wnt signaling or PTH treatment. However, it is still unclear whether lactate, the end product of aerobic glycolysis, plays any role in osteoblast differentiation. Herein we report that in cultures of osteoblast-lineage cells, lactate promoted alkaline phosphatase -positive cell formation, increased the activity of alkaline phosphatase, and induced the expression of osteocalcin. This osteoblast differentiation -inducing effect of lactate can be inhibited by blocking its entry into cells with MCT1 siRNA or inhibitors, and by interfering with its metabolism by using specific siRNAs for LDHB and PDH. Moreover, lactate stabilized HIF1α expression and inhibited HIF1α activity, with BAY87-2243 lowering the osteoblast differentiation -inducing effect of lactate. Thus, these findings reveal an unrecognized role for aerobic glycolysis in osteoblast differentiation via its end product, lactate.

28538491|t|Committee Opinion No. 701 Summary: Choosing The Route Of Hysterectomy For Benign Disease
28538491|a|Hysterectomy is one of the most frequently performed surgical procedures in the United States. Selection of the route of hysterectomy for benign causes can be influenced by the size and shape of the vagina and uterus; accessibility to the uterus; extent of extrauterine disease; the need for concurrent procedures; surgeon training and experience; average case volume; available hospital technology, devices, and support; whether the case is emergent or scheduled; and preference of the informed patient. Vaginal and laparoscopic procedures are considered " minimally invasive " surgical approaches because they do not require a large abdominal incision and, thus, typically are associated with shortened hospitalization and postoperative recovery times compared with open abdominal hysterectomy. Minimally invasive approaches to hysterectomy should be performed, whenever feasible, based on their well-documented advantages over abdominal hysterectomy. The vaginal approach is preferred among the minimally invasive approaches. Laparoscopic hysterectomy is a preferable alternative to open abdominal hysterectomy for those patients in whom a vaginal hysterectomy is not indicated or feasible. Although minimally invasive approaches to hysterectomy are the preferred route, open abdominal hysterectomy remains an important surgical option for some patients. The obstetrician - gynecologist should discuss the options with patients and make clear recommendations on which route of hysterectomy will maximize benefits and minimize risks given the specific clinical situation. The relative advantages and disadvantages of the approaches to hysterectomy should be discussed in the context of the patient 's values and preferences, and the patient and health care provider should together determine the best course of action after this discussion.

28538990|t|Measuring nonlinear signal combination using EEG
28538990|a|Relatively little is known about the processes, both linear and nonlinear, by which signals are combined beyond V1. By presenting two stimulus components simultaneously, flickering at different temporal frequencies (frequency tagging) while measuring steady-state visual evoked potentials, we can assess responses to the individual components, including direct measurements of suppression on each other, and various nonlinear responses to their combination found at intermodulation frequencies. The result is a rather rich dataset of frequencies at which responses can be found. We presented pairs of sinusoidal gratings at different temporal frequencies, forming plaid patterns that were " coherent " (looking like a checkerboar d) and " noncoherent " (looking like a pair of transparently overlaid gratings), and found clear intermodulation responses to compound stimuli, indicating nonlinear summation. This might have been attributed to cross-orientation suppression except that the pattern of intermodulation responses differed for coherent and noncoherent patterns, whereas the effects of suppression (measured at the component frequencies) did not. A two-stage model of nonlinear summation involving conjunction detection with a logical AND gate described the data well, capturing the difference between coherent and noncoherent plaids over a wide array of possible response frequencies. Multistimulus frequency -tagged EEG in combination with computational modeling may be a very valuable tool in studying the conjunction of these signals. In the current study the results suggest a second-order mechanism responding selectively to coherent plaid patterns.

28539349|t|Sleep Loss Promotes Astrocytic Phagocytosis and Microglial Activation in Mouse Cerebral Cortex
28539349|a|We previously found that Mertk and its ligand Gas6, astrocytic genes involved in phagocytosis, are upregulated after acute sleep deprivation. These results suggested that astrocytes may engage in phagocytic activity during extended wake, but direct evidence was lacking. Studies in humans and rodents also found that sleep loss increases peripheral markers of inflammation, but whether these changes are associated with neuroinflammation and/or activation of microglia, the brain's resident innate immune cells, was unknown. Here we used serial block-face scanning electron microscopy to obtain 3D volume measurements of synapses and surrounding astrocytic processes in mouse frontal cortex after 6-8 h of sleep, spontaneous wake, or sleep deprivation (SD) and after chronic (∼5 d) sleep restriction (CSR). Astrocytic phagocytosis, mainly of presynaptic components of large synapses, increased after both acute and chronic sleep loss relative to sleep and wake. MERTK expression and lipid peroxidation in synaptoneurosomes also increased to a similar extent after short and long sleep loss, suggesting that astrocytic phagocytosis may represent the brain's response to the increase in synaptic activity associated with prolonged wake, clearing worn components of heavily used synapses. Using confocal microscopy, we then found that CSR but not SD mice show morphological signs of microglial activation and enhanced microglial phagocytosis of synaptic elements, without obvious signs of neuroinflammation in the CSF. Because low - level sustained microglia activation can lead to abnormal responses to a secondary insult, these results suggest that chronic sleep loss, through microglia priming, may predispose the brain to further damage .SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We find that astrocytic phagocytosis of synaptic elements, mostly of presynaptic origin and in large synapses, is upregulated already after a few hours of sleep deprivation and shows a further significant increase after prolonged and severe sleep loss, suggesting that it may promote the housekeeping of heavily used and strong synapses in response to the increased neuronal activity of extended wake. By contrast, chronic sleep restriction but not acute sleep loss activates microglia, promotes their phagocytic activity, and does so in the absence of overt signs of neuroinflammation, suggesting that like many other stressors, extended sleep disruption may lead to a state of sustained microglia activation, perhaps increasing the brain's susceptibility to other forms of damage.

28540341|t|Reflections on Hip Fracture Recovery From Older Adults Enrolled in a Clinical Trial
28540341|a|This study describes patients' perspectives on recovery during participation in a randomized controlled trial that tested a postoperative hip fracture management program (B4 Clinic), compared with usual care, on mobility. Semistructured qualitative interviews were conducted with 50 older adults with hip fracture (from both groups) twice over 12 months. A total of 32 women (64%) and 18 men (36%) participated in the study with a mean age at baseline of 82 (range = 65-98) years. A total of 40 participants reported recovery goals at some point during their recovery from hip fracture but only 18 participants realized their goals within 12 months. Recovering mobility, returning to prefracture activities, and obtaining stable health were the most commonly reported goals. Participants described good social support, access to physiotherapy, and positive perspective as most important to recovery. These factors were influenced by participants ' knowledge, resources, and monthly contact with study staff (perceived as a form of social support). The most frequently reported barriers to participants ' recovery were the onset of complications, pain, and limited access to physiotherapy. Potential implications of these findings include design and modification of new or preexisting fracture programs, prioritizing patient engagement and enhanced knowledge for future clinical research in hip fracture recovery.

28542333|t|It takes biking to learn: Physical activity improves learning a second language
28542333|a|Recent studies have shown that concurrent physical activity enhances learning a completely unfamiliar L2 vocabulary as compared to learning it in a static condition. In this paper we report a study whose aim is twofold: to test for possible positive effects of physical activity when L2 learning has already reached some level of proficiency, and to test whether the assumed better performance when engaged in physical activity is limited to the linguistic level probed at training (i.e. L2 vocabulary tested by means of a Word-Picture Verification task), or whether it extends also to the sentence level (which was tested by means of a Sentence Semantic Judgment Task). The results show that Chinese speakers with basic knowledge of English benefited from physical activity while learning a set of new words. Furthermore, their better performance emerged also at the sentential level, as shown by their performance in a Semantic Judgment task. Finally, an interesting temporal asymmetry between the lexical and the sentential level emerges, with the difference between the experimental and control group emerging from the 1st testing session at the lexical level but after several weeks at the sentential level.

28543041|t|The added value of cardiac index and pulse pressure variation monitoring to mean arterial pressure - guided volume therapy in moderate-risk abdominal surgery (COGUIDE): a pragmatic multicentre randomised controlled trial
28543041|a|There is disagreement regarding the benefits of goal-directed therapy in moderate-risk abdominal surgery. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that the addition of non-invasive cardiac index and pulse pressure variation monitoring to mean arterial pressure -based goal-directed therapy would reduce the incidence of postoperative complications in patients having moderate-risk abdominal surgery. In this pragmatic multicentre randomised controlled trial, we randomly allocated 244 patients by envelope drawing in a 1:1 fashion, stratified per centre. All patients had mean arterial pressure, cardiac index and pulse pressure variation measured continuously. In one group, healthcare professionals were blinded to cardiac index and pulse pressure variation values and were asked to guide haemodynamic therapy only based on mean arterial pressure (control group). In the second group, cardiac index and pulse pressure variation values were displayed and kept within target ranges following a pre-defined algorithm (CI-PPV group). The primary endpoint was the incidence of postoperative complications within 30 days. One hundred and seventy-five patients were eligible for final analysis. Overall complication rates were similar (42/94 (44.7%) vs. 38/81 (46.9%) in the control and CI-PPV groups, respectively; p = 0.95). The CI-PPV group had lower mean (SD) pulse pressure variation values (9.5 (2.0)% vs. 11.9 (4.6)%; p = 0.003) and higher mean (SD) cardiac indices (2.76 (0.62) l min(-1) .m(-2) vs. 2.53 (0.66) l min(-1) .m(-2); p = 0.004) than the control group. In moderate-risk abdominal surgery, we observed no additional value of cardiac index and pulse pressure variation - guided haemodynamic therapy to mean arterial pressure - guided volume therapy with regard to postoperative complications.

28544215|t|Anterior single implants with different neck designs: 5 Year results of a randomized clinical trial
28544215|a|The design of the implant neck might be significant for preservation of marginal bone. To compare the 5-year radiographic and clinical outcome of single anterior implants provided with a smooth neck, a rough neck or a scalloped rough neck. 93 Patients with a missing anterior tooth in the maxilla were included. At random, patients received an implant with a 1.5 mm smooth neck (" smooth group "), a rough neck with grooves (" rough group ") or a scalloped rough neck with grooves (" scalloped group "). Implants were installed in healed sites. Follow-up visits were conducted after final crown delivery and 1 year and 5 years later. Scalloped implants showed significantly more initial marginal bone resorption. The total amount of bone loss was 1.26 ± 0.90 mm in the smooth group, 1.20 ± 1.1 mm in the rough group and 2.28 ± 0.97 mm in the scalloped group (P < .05). Survival rates were 96.2% for the smooth and scalloped group and 100% for the rough group. Scalloped implants showed deeper pocket depths, more bleeding and more technical complications. There were no differences in esthetic outcome nor in patient satisfaction. For anterior single tooth replacements, scalloped implants show less favorable radiographic and clinical outcome compared to regular implants with a smooth neck or rough neck.

28544275|t|Recessive mutations in MSTO1 cause mitochondrial dynamics impairment, leading to myopathy and ataxia
28544275|a|We report here the first families carrying recessive variants in the MSTO1 gene: compound heterozygous mutations were identified in two sisters and in an unrelated singleton case, who presented a multisystem complex phenotype mainly characterized by myopathy and cerebellar ataxia. Human MSTO1 is a poorly studied protein, suggested to have mitochondrial localization and to regulate morphology and distribution of mitochondria. As for other mutations affecting genes involved in mitochondrial dynamics, no biochemical defects typical of mitochondrial disorders were reported. Studies in patients ' fibroblasts revealed that MSTO1 protein levels were strongly reduced, the mitochondrial network was fragmented and the fusion events among mitochondria were decreased, confirming the deleterious effect of the identified variants and the role of MSTO1 in modulating mitochondrial dynamics. We also found that MSTO1 is mainly a cytosolic protein. These findings indicate recessive mutations in MSTO1 as a new cause for inherited neuromuscular disorders with multisystem features.

28545217|t|A miniature bird -borne passive air sampler for monitoring halogenated flame retardants
28545217|a|Birds have been used intensively as biomonitors of halogenated flame retardants (HFRs), and several studies have reported elevated tissue concentrations and inter- individual variability for these contaminants. While diet is known to be an important exposure pathway for HFRs in birds, it has been suggested that exposure through air may represent an underestimated source of HFRs for certain species. However, a method was not available for measuring the atmospheric exposure of individual birds to HFRs or other semi-volatile contaminants. The goal of this study was to develop a bird -borne passive air sampler (PAS) enabling the determination of individual atmospheric exposure to gas - and particle-phase HFRs using the ring-billed gull (Larus delawarensis) nesting in the Montreal area (QC, Canada). The new miniaturized elliptical-shaped PAS (mean weight: 2.72g) was tested using two sorbent types during three exposure periods (one, two and three weeks). Results showed that PAS using polyurethane foam (PUF) combined with a glass fiber filter collected all major polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and exhibited better performance for collecting highly hydrophobic DecaBDE mixture congeners compared to the PAS using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Emerging HFRs including hexabromobenzene, Dechlorane 604 Component B, and Dechlorane plus (DP) isomers also were sampled by the PUF -based PAS. Sampling rates for most HFRs were comparable between the three exposure periods. This novel bird -borne PAS provides valuable information on the non-dietary exposure of free-ranging birds to HFRs.

28545437|t|Post endodontic pain following single-visit root canal preparation with rotary vs reciprocating instruments: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials
28545437|a|In endodontic therapy, continuous rotary instrumentation reduced debris compared to reciprocal instrumentation, which might affect the incidence of post-endodontic pain (PP). The aim of our study was to assess whether PP incidence and levels were influenced by the choice of rotary or reciprocal instruments. In this meta-analysis the Pubmed and EM databases were searched for prospective clinical randomized trials published before April 20, 2016, using combinations of the keywords: root canal preparation / instrumentation / treatment / therapy; post-operative / endodontic pain; reciprocal and rotary instruments. Three studies were included, involving a total of 1,317 patients, 659 treated with reciprocating instruments and 658 treated with rotary instruments. PP was reported in 139 patients in the reciprocating group and 172 in the rotary group. The PP incidence odds ratio was 1.27 with 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.25, 6.52) favoring rotary instruments. The mild, moderate and severe PP levels odds ratios were 0.31 (0.11, 0.84), 2.24 (0.66, 7.59) and 11.71 (0.63, 218.15), respectively. No evidence of publication bias was found. Rotary instrument choice in endodontic therapy is associated with a lower incidence of PP than reciprocating instruments, while reciprocating instruments are associated with less mild PP incidence.

28546554|t|High throughput resistance profiling of Plasmodium falciparum infections based on custom dual indexing and Illumina next generation sequencing-technology
28546554|a|Genetic polymorphisms in P. falciparum can be used to indicate the parasite's susceptibility to antimalarial drugs as well as its geographical origin. Both of these factors are key to monitoring development and spread of antimalarial drug resistance. In this study, we combine multiplex PCR, custom designed dual indexing and Miseq sequencing for high throughput SNP - profiling of 457 malaria infections from Guinea-Bissau, at the cost of 10 USD per sample. By amplifying and sequencing 15 genetic fragments, we cover 20 resistance -conferring SNPs occurring in pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhfr, pfdhps, as well as the entire length of pfK13, and the mitochondrial barcode for parasite origin. SNPs of interest were sequenced with an average depth of 2,043 reads, and bases were called for the various SNP - positions with a p-value below 0.05, for 89.8-100% of samples. The SNP data indicates that artemisinin resistance -conferring SNPs in pfK13 are absent from the studied area of Guinea-Bissau, while the pfmdr1 86 N allele is found at a high prevalence. The mitochondrial barcodes are unanimous and accommodate a West African origin of the parasites. With this method, very reliable high throughput surveillance of antimalarial drug resistance becomes more affordable than ever before.

28549399|t|A systematic review investigating psychosocial aspects of egg sharing in the United Kingdom and their potential effects on egg donation numbers
28549399|a|This review aims to provide an up-to-date knowledge of the psychosocial aspects of egg donation from the perspectives of the egg share donor and their recipient. It explores the motives, experiences and attitudes of egg sharers and their views towards donor anonymity and disclosure. Conclusions are made on how these findings can guide clinical practice and improve egg sharing numbers. A systematic search of peer-reviewed journals of four computerized databases was undertaken. Eleven studies were included in the review. Psychosocial aspects towards donation were positive from the egg share donor and recipient. Concerns raised were whether participating in the egg sharing scheme would impact on their success rates, as well as frustration expressed by a minority regarding the lack of knowledge of egg sharing outside of fertility clinics. The 2005 legislative changes in the UK have not caused the anticipated dramatic decrease in egg donation; however, oocyte donation still falls short of demand. Egg sharing provides a practical option for more patients to access IVF, whilst also providing more donor oocytes. Improved information provision will result in greater awareness of egg sharing, with the potential to recruit more donors and meet the needs of recipients currently on long waiting lists.

28550348|t|Medication regimen complexity and prevalence of potentially inappropriate medicines in older patients after hospitalisation
28550348|a|Background There is a relative paucity of information to characterise potential changes in medication regimen complexity and prevalence of prescribing of potentially inappropriate medications after hospitalisation, both in Australia and elsewhere. Objective To evaluate medication regimen complexity and the prevalence of potentially inappropriate medications before and after admission to hospital. Setting General medical units of a tertiary care hospital in Australia. Methods Retrospective cohort study of patients aged 65 years and above. Medication complexity was measured by using the Medication Regimen Complexity Index (MRCI). Main outcome measure The primary outcome was the change in the Medication Regimen Complexity Index for all prescribed medications after hospitalization. Results A convenience sample of 100 patients was included in the study. There was a significant change in the mean medication complexity score (as measured using the MRCI), increasing from 29 at the time of admission to 32 at the time of discharge (p < 0.05). Factors such as baseline medication regimen complexity (pre-admission MRCI) and length of stay in the hospitals appear to influence the change in medication complexity. However, the proportion of patients prescribed at least one potentially inappropriate medicine (PIM) decreased significantly, from 52% pre-hospitalization to 42% at discharge (p = 0.04). Conclusions Relative to the time of admission, overall medication complexity increased and the proportion of patients who were prescribed PIMs decreased after hospitalisation.
