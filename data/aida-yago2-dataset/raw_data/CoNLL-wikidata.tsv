Rangarajan	B	Rangarajan	--OOKBE--	PERSON
explained
that
the

was
an
instrument
that

could
use
to
regulate

supply
by
reducing

increasing
the
ratio

But
in

the

the

barter

25-30

able

handle

"
Before

was

I
always
felt
I
had
to
be
in

by
9:30

10
o'clock

I
had
to
be
up
at

against
someone
you
have
never

"
he
said

"
I
got
more
aggressive
in
the

third

the
wind
picked
up

He

"
Volatility

longer-dated

now
perhaps

buy

"
he

"
Long

volatility
has

low

it

three

size
and
what
its
owner
planned
to
do
with
it
.

Trading
sources
generally
agreed
it
would
be
cost-effective
to
take
the
copper
back
into
a
depleted
central
reserve
as
it
had
already
served
its
purpose
in
taking
advantage
of
long-term
backwardation
on
the
London	B	London Metal Exchange	Q952937	ORGANIZATION
Metal	I	London Metal Exchange	Q952937	ORGANIZATION
Exchange	I	London Metal Exchange	Q952937	ORGANIZATION
(
LME	B	LME	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
)
.

A
backwardation
occurs
when
the
spot
price
of
a
metal
is
higher
than
the
forward
price
.

CNIEC	B	CNIEC	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
lent
around
85,000
tonnes
of
copper
onto
the
LME	B	LME	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
between
April
and
June
1995
on
behalf
of
the
state
reserve
,
running
the
state
stockpile
down
to
115,000
tonnes
from
200,000
tonnes
previously
.

Traders
in
Asia	B	Asia	Q48	LOCATION
said
CNIEC	B	CNIEC	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
could
well
have
lent
it
to
the
market
at
around
US$	B	US$	Q4917	MISC
2,700
a
tonne
,
and
then
paid
somewhere
between
$
2,200
and
$
2,400
a
tonne
when
it
started
taking
the
metal
back
earlier
this
year
.

This
would
have
cleared
CNIEC	B	CNIEC	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
a
healthy
profit
,
which
could
then
have
been
used
to
finance
storage
and
other
costs
.

Word
that
CNIEC	B	CNIEC	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
had
offered
the
copper
to
European	B	European	Q46	MISC
trading
houses
in
a
series
of
secret
meetings
unnerved
an
already
jittery
market
.

Economics	I	Bloomsbury Minerals Economics	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
(
BME	B	BME	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
)
said
on
Wednesday
the
motivation
of
the
owners
of
the
85,000
tonnes
,
"
whoever
they
are
,
is
the
most
important
short-term
fundamental
"
in
an
already
tight
world
market
.

BME	B	BME	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
repeated
in
its

rumours
of
involvement
by
Sumitomo	B	Sumitomo Corp	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
Corp	I	Sumitomo Corp	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
,
with
CNIEC	B	CNIEC	--NME--	ORGANIZATION

unload
its
copper
positions
after
it
revealed
in
June
losses
of
$
1.8
billion
in
a
decade
of
unauthorised
deals
.

Sumitomo	B	Sumitomo	Q4671036	ORGANIZATION
and
CNIEC	B	CNIEC	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
have
made
no
comments
on
the
talk
and
Chinese	B	Chinese	Q148	MISC
traders
said
they
know
nothing
of
such
an
arrangement
.

Traders
in
Shanghai	B	Shanghai	Q8686	LOCATION
said
on
Thursday
they
were
unaware
of
movements
out
of
the
Shanghai	B	Shanghai	Q8686	LOCATION
bonded
warehouses
.

They
reported
more
arrivals
that
were
probably
spot
purchases
.

They
also
expressed
concern
that
the
tonnage
in
bonded
warehouses
would
move
onto
the
domestic
market
.

But
these
concerns
were
irrelevant
,
a
Singapore	B	Singapore	Q334	LOCATION
trader
said
,
despite
a
forecast
that
domestic
Chinese	B	Chinese	Q148	MISC
copper
demand
could
hit
one
million
tonnes
this
year
.

As
with
many
commodities
,
"
there
is
a
desire
(
by
the
Chinese	B	Chinese	Q148	MISC
government
)
to
keep
a
stockpile
of
the
metal
,
"
he
said
.
"

You
do
n't
keep
it
to
help
industry
,
you
keep
it
in
case
of
emergency
.

the

dropped
as
a
disciplinary
measure
after
arriving
only
35
minutes
before
the

provided
the

spot

as
the
touring

batted
on
to
reach
413

Lewis	B	Lewis	--NME--	PERSON

There

offered
apologies
for
any
mistakes
they
had
made
and
accepted
broad

for
the

But
none
named
those
guilty
of
ordering
or
carrying
out
any
of
the
gross
violations
of
human
rights
which
Tutu	B	Tutu	Q43033	PERSON

investigating
.

Human
rights
lawyer
Brian	B	Brian Currin	Q3755412	PERSON
Currin	I	Brian Currin	Q3755412	PERSON
said
the
hearings
last
week
were
not
intended
as
a
form
of
confessional
and
that
those
who
personally
committed
crimes
during
apartheid
would
testify
only
before
a
separate
arm
of
the
commission
,
the
amnesty
committee
.

"
I
do
n't
think
one
should
have
expected
more
than
what
one
got
,
"
he
said
.
"

That
was
not
the
amnesty
committee
where
perpetrators
are
expected
to
open
their
hearts
and
souls
and
to
tell
it
all
.
"

The
commission
,
which
has
the
power
to
grant
amnesty
to
those
who
confess
to
abuses
,
has
begun
hearing
the
testimony
from
people
already
in
jail
for
their
deeds
.

But
others
,
such
as
self-confessed
secret
police
hit-squad
leader
Dirk	B	Dirk Coetzee	Q1227804	PERSON
Coetzee	I	Dirk Coetzee	Q1227804	PERSON

have

testify
.

Tutu	B	Tutu	Q43033	PERSON
's
deputy
chairman
,
Alex	B	Alex Boraine	--NME--	PERSON
Boraine	I	Alex Boraine	--NME--	PERSON
,
told
reporters
the
commission
would
begin
issuing
subpoenas
to
suspects
who
refused
to
appear
voluntarily
some
time
this
week
.

He
added
that
former
hardline
apartheid
president
P.W.	B	P.W. Botha	Q212286	PERSON
Botha	I	P.W. Botha	Q212286	PERSON
could
be
among
those
called
.

But
Currin	B	Currin	Q3755412	PERSON
,
who
is
advising
several
people
regarded
as
perpetrators
,
said
this
was
not
the
best
way
to
achieve
the
commission
's
aims
.

"
A
person
can
be
forced
to
appear
,
but
the
only
way
one
is
going
to
get
to
the
truth
in
its
totality
is
if
people
feel
it
is
a
good
idea
to
go
to
the
amnesty
committee
.

At
the
moment
this
is
not
the
case
.
"

He
cited
Coetzee	B	Coetzee	Q1227804	PERSON
,
who
was
charged
with
murder
after
confessing
in
media
interviews
to
dirty
tricks
.

His
trial
is
due
to
start
in
December
but
the
truth
commission
intends
to
decide
on
his
amnesty
application
before
that
.

Currin	B	Currin	Q3755412	PERSON
said
the
law
had
to
be
changed
so
all
judicial
prosecutions
were
automatically
suspended
for
those
who
approached
the
truth
commission
.

Boraine	B	Boraine	--NME--	PERSON
said
the
picture
was
incomplete
because
officers
of
the
apartheid-era
security
forces
had
yet
to
make
their
scheduled
,
separate
submission
,
but
one
black
caller
to
a
radio
talk
show
declared
:

"
This
whole
thing
is
utterly
useless
,
it
does
n't
help
us
at
all
.

What
the
people
expect
is
to
have
houses
,
to
have
jobs
.
"

Political
scientist
Jannie	B	Jannie Gagiano	--NME--	PERSON
Gagiano	I	Jannie Gagiano	--NME--	PERSON
said
he
doubted
that
the

Party	I	National Party	Q740718	ORGANIZATION
,
which
implemented
apartheid
in
1948
and
began
dismantling
it
in
1990
,
felt
it
carried
a
burden
of
guilt
and
needed
to
be
exculpated
through
the
commission
.

"
Therefore
I
have
some
doubts
about
achieving
some
form
of
reconciliation
.

One
has
to
feel
a
bit
guilty
to
feel
the
need
for
reconciling
yourself
to
a
historical
adversary
,

is
planning
major
changes
in
employee
compensation
in
the
next
few
years
,
according
to
a
recent
study
.

What
it
comes
down
to
is
this
:
If
you
're
highly
skilled
,
you
'll
benefit
nicely
.

But
if
you
're
not
and
cannot
contribute
to
your
employer
's
goals
,
you
'll
be
paid
less
.

The
survey
,
conducted
in
late
1995
and
the
early
part
of
this
year
by
management
consulting
firm
Towers	B	Towers Perrin	Q3535944	ORGANIZATION
Perrin	I	Towers Perrin	Q3535944	ORGANIZATION
,
showed
that
the
focus
will
be
on
an
employee
's
overall
value
to
the
company
's
bottom
line
--
rather
than
how
well
an
employee
performs
a
specific
task
.

Presently
,
for
example
,
if
an
accountant
's
job
involves
doing
five
specific
tasks
,
he
or
she
can
expect
a
certain
salary
,
said

O'Neal	I	Sandra O'Neal	--NME--	PERSON
,
a
Towers	B	Towers Perrin	Q3535944	ORGANIZATION
Perrin	I	Towers Perrin	Q3535944	ORGANIZATION
principal
.

In
the
future
,
the
accountant
will
be
evaluated
solely
on
"
knowledge
,
skill
and
abilities
,
"
she
said
.

In
addition
to
using
accounting
skills
,
the
accountant
will
also
have
to
be
creative
,
work
well
in
a
team
,
be
sensitive
to
customer
needs
and
set
productivity
goals
.

"
The
good
news
is
,
if
you
're
highly
skilled
and
have
many
abilities
,
you
'll
be
paid
more
,
"
said
O'Neal	B	O'Neal	--NME--	PERSON
.

"
The
bad
news
is
,
if
you
're
not
skilled
and
ca
n't
contribute
to
a
team
,
to
customer
service
and
the
organisation
's
goals
,
you
'll
be
paid
less
.
"

Of
the
750
mid-to-large
size
corporations
surveyed
,
81
percent
had
undergone
a
major
restructuring
in
the
last
three
years
,
and
more
than
two-thirds
reported
that
productivity
and
profits
were
up
as
result
.

Next
on
the
agenda
for
these
firms
is
developing
a
new
compensation
structure
,
and
78
percent
report
that
they
are
considering
a
new
,
skills-based
plan
for
both
management
and
non-management
employees
.

This
coming
shift
,
O'Neal	B	O'Neal	--NME--	PERSON
said
,
"
is
not
just
isolated
or
a
fad
.

It
's
an
inexorable
change
.
"

After
World	B	World War II	Q362	MISC
War	I	World War II	Q362	MISC
II	I	World War II	Q362	MISC
,
corporations
adopted
a
"
military
model
"
creating
hierarchical
organisations
where
"
the
concept
of
defined
tasks
worked
great
,
"
she
said
.

But
as
the
economy
became
global
,
customers
were
more
demanding
and
problems
became
more
complex
.

"
Multi-layers
kept
management
at
a
distance
from
its
customers
,
"
O'Neal	B	O'Neal	--NME--	PERSON
said
.

Now
organisations
must
change
to
stay
competitive
.

O'Neal	B	O'Neal	--NME--	PERSON
says
firms
will
place
a
greater
emphasis
on
teams
and
team
performance
in
giving
raises
.

If
your
team
does
well
,
you
'll
do
well
.

If
it
does
n't
do
well
,
do
n't
expect
a
raise
.

Is
this
fair
to
an
employee
who
can
go
the
distance
but
is
on
a
team
that
ca
n't
keep
up
?

"
That
's
an
important
question
we
used
to
ask
a
lot
,
"
said
O'Neal	B	O'Neal	--NME--	PERSON
.
"

It
's
not
a
question
we
ask
any
more
.

The
more
important
question
is
--
'
Do
we
have
results
?
'

"

To
get
those
results
,
27
percent
of
the
companies
surveyed
plan
to
eliminate
base
pay
increases
in
favour
of
cash
bonuses
and
incentives
,
such
as
employee
and
team
award
programmes
and
education
.

Companies
that
can
change
their
culture
and
view
employees
as
business
partners
will
do
well
,
O'Neal	B	O'Neal	--NME--	PERSON
said
.

For
example
,
the
survey
rated
some
participants
in
the
survey
as
"
high-performing
"
companies
,
based
on
their
return
on
equity
above
16
percent
.

Those
companies
also
said
they
already
offer
employees
variable
pay
and
business
education
,
give
their
managers
more
control
over
pay
decisions
and
celebrate
employee
and
team
success
.

"
They
respect
employees
more
,
they
trust
employees
more
and
they
value
their
employees
more
,
"
O'Neal	B	O'Neal	--NME--	PERSON
said
.

"
The
key
to
success
at
high-performance
companies
is
engaging
employees
in
a
business
partnership
.

It
will
improve
a
company
's
bottom
line
.

the

Planted

early

the

traditionally
grows
better
than

wheat

Further
plans

he

called

"
If

Borkus	B	Borkus	--NME--	PERSON

The

phase
out
huge
subsidies
to
the
farm
sector
,
and
in
a
move
back
to
pre-Soviet	B	pre-Soviet	--NME--	MISC

some
36,000
private
farmers
willing
to
go
it
alone
.

Collective
farms
will
last
for
the
next
few
years
,
because
most
private

now
only
produce
enough
to
feed
themselves
with

a

extra
to
sell

said

"
In

maybe

it

"
Collectivisation

Citing
the

of
Gencor	B	Gencor	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
's
stake
in
industrial
holdings
group
Malbak	B	Malbak Ltd	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
Ltd	I	Malbak Ltd	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
for
one
billion
rand
among
other
smaller
disposals
,
Gilbertson	B	Gilbertson	--NME--	PERSON
said
Gencor	B	Gencor	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
had
pruned
its
portfolio
to
concentrate
on
core
assets
.

"
We
've
tried
to
clean
up
our
overall
portfolio
by
disposing
of
non-core
assets
.

The
biggest
of
those
was
Malbak	B	Malbak	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
.

Overall
a
very
substantial
pruning
...

leaving
Gencor	B	Gencor	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
clearly
structured
along
commodity
lines
,
"
Gilbertson	B	Gilbertson	--NME--	PERSON
said
.

He
added
that
the
group
still
had
about
85
million
rand
after
tax
invested
in
various
shares
,
which
were
market
for
disposal
when
required
.

Referring
to
Gencor	B	Gencor	--NME--	ORGANIZATION

increased
41.5
percent
stake
in
Ingwe	B	Ingwe	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
,
Gilbertson	B	Gilbertson	--NME--	PERSON
said
the
group
would
wait
for
coal
shares
to
be
cheaper
before
considering
snapping
up
more
.

"
I
think
we
would
have
liked
to
have
more
of
Ingwe	B	Ingwe	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
but
it
's
the
question
of
adding
value
.

When
we
bought
the
shares
we
bought
...

at
quite
a
bit
lower
than
the
price
is
now
...

maybe
if
we
just
wait
another
few
years
for
the
next
downturn
in
coal
.
"

Finally
,
Gilbertson	B	Gilbertson	--NME--	PERSON
said
a
growing
proportion
of
Gencor	B	Gencor	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
's
income
was
coming
from
offshore

Indeed

a

glass
of

white
zinfandel
was
going
for

while
an
imported

was
just
a

more
than

Maybe
they
want
us

be
alcoholics

"
Perry	B	Perry	--NME--	PERSON

before
lifting
her
glass
of
wine

Fans
will
be
shelling
out
$

for
a

a
large
french

And
that
little
snack
is
guaranteed
to
make

Make
that
$

Even
a
sandwich
as
pedestrian
as
a
ham
and
swiss
cheese
is
going
for
a
whopping
$
8.00
.

Of
course
,
it
is
served
on

It
must
be
the
cost

instead
taking

The
way

But
once
the

The
suspicion

lingers

's
mind
that

did
tamper
with
the

benefit

"
I
get
the
feeling
that
everything
is
done
here

they
forget
about

centre

engulfed

tournament

The

was
bumped
up
two
spots
from
his
ATP	B	ATP	Q744089	ORGANIZATION
ranking
of
eight
to
a
seeding

six

"
He
(
Agassi	B	Agassi	Q7407	PERSON

should
be
seeded
the
way
he
is
playing
tennis
right
now

"
said
Stich	B	Stich	Q60109	PERSON
about
the
unfairness
of
moving
up
Agassi	B	Agassi	Q7407	PERSON

who
made

exits
from
the
French	B	French Open	Q43605	MISC

Stich	B	Stich	Q60109	PERSON
,
not
seeded
here
for
the
first
time
since
1990
,
might
have
benefitted
from
some
fiddling
with
the
seedings
himself
after
Kafelnikov	B	Kafelnikov	Q207705	PERSON
withdrew
.

Ranked
18th
in

originally
.

But
Stich	B	Stich	Q60109	PERSON
did
n't
want
to
play
that
game

"
I
think
he
deserves

everybody
else

top
16
deserves

Yeltsin	I	Boris Yeltsin	Q34453	PERSON
on

in
the
region
when
he
was
forced
to
abandon
plans
to
sign
a
new
political

with
the

It
could
be
a
sobering
experience
for
the
Kremlin	B	Kremlin	Q133274	LOCATION
security
chief
who
,
just
two
months
after
being
appointed
by
the
president
and
two
heady
weeks
after
taking
charge

the
Chechen	B	Chechen	Q5187	MISC

,
had
promised
to
wrap
up
the
20-month

by
the
weekend
.

Despite
a
mood
of
compromise
in
the
region
after
some
of
the
worst
fighting
of
the
war
,
Lebed	B	Lebed	Q295898	PERSON
may
be

finding
out
that
concluding

long-term

somewhere
between
rebel

's
insistence
that
Chechnya	B	Chechnya	Q5187	LOCATION
remain
part

Russia	B	Russia	Q159	LOCATION

will
be
no

A

former
paratroop
general
with
a
sharp
line
in
deadpan
putdowns
and
a
soldier
's
knack
for
making
life
sound
simple
,
Lebed	B	Lebed	Q295898	PERSON
managed
to
arrange
an
ambitious

in

last

,
days
after
the

bomb
its
way
back

rebel-held
Chechen	B	Chechen	Q5187	MISC

Grozny	B	Grozny	Q5196	LOCATION

He
returned

the
weekend
,
pledging
to
conclude
a
political
settlement
that
would
make
this
truce
work
where
all
others
have
failed
.

But
then
he
apparently
thought
better
of
it

he
needed
to
tidy
up
legal

on
the

--
and
also
cover

could
meet
Yeltsin	B	Yeltsin	Q34453	PERSON
on

It
was
not
clear
if
the
start
of
Yeltsin	B	Yeltsin	Q34453	PERSON
's

,
announced
later
,
would
affect
plans

It
is
not
known
what
caused
the
delay

Speculation
mounted
last

that
Lebed	B	Lebed	Q295898	PERSON
was
operating
out
on
a
limb
in
Chechnya	B	Chechnya	Q5187	LOCATION
as
Yeltsin	B	Yeltsin	Q34453	PERSON
,
hardly
seen

kept
out

and
then
gave
an
interview
criticising
his

just
as
he
clinched
a

But
Chernomyrdin	B	Chernomyrdin	Q190884	PERSON
took
pains
at
the
weekend
to
insist
Lebed	B	Lebed	Q295898	PERSON
was
playing

took

Maskhadov	I	Aslan Maskhadov	Q193354	PERSON
had
been
agreed
by
Yeltsin	B	Yeltsin	Q34453	PERSON
.

If
that
were
the
case
,
it
was
unclear
why
Lebed	B	Lebed	Q295898	PERSON
suddenly
found
it
necessary
to
have
the
deal
verified
in
Moscow	B	Moscow	Q649	LOCATION
.

Lebed	B	Lebed	Q295898	PERSON
himself
said
he
was
concerned
that
powerful
interests
in
Moscow	B	Moscow	Q649	LOCATION
,
who
have
profited
from
the
war
and
want
it
to
go
on
,
would
seize
on
any
inadequacy
in
the
deal
to
remove
him
.

Maskhadov	B	Maskhadov	Q193354	PERSON
warned
that
Lebed	B	Lebed	Q295898	PERSON
risked
the
same
fate
as
a
former
Russian	B	Russian	Q159	MISC
army
commander
in
the

who
sought
a
compromise
and
was
blown
up
last
year
by

Maskhadov	B	Maskhadov	Q193354	PERSON
may
also
have
made
new
demands
on
Lebed	B	Lebed	Q295898	PERSON
,
forcing
him
to
check
back
with
the
Kremlin	B	Kremlin	Q1140115	LOCATION
on
what
he
could
offer
.

A
rebel
spokesman
said
the
two
military
men
had
come
close
to
agreement
on
a
face-saving
formula
acceptable
to
both
sides
and
involving
a
referendum
on
independence
at
some
future
date
.

Chernomyrdin	B	Chernomyrdin	Q190884	PERSON
said
voters
should
decide
Chechnya	B	Chechnya	Q5187	LOCATION

while

Both
will
have
their
impact
on
Cofinec	B	Cofinec	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
's
figures
,
the
analysts
said
.

Despite
the
current
difficulties
,
however
,
analysts
were
convinced
that
Cofinec	B	Cofinec	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
's
outlook
was
strong
.

"
The
eastern
European	B	European	Q46	MISC

offers
good

"

Just
like

,
Cofinec	B	Cofinec	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
has
big

opportunities
.
"

"
At
the

time
,
it
's
an
advantage
for
Cofinec	B	Cofinec	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
that
it
has
a
foreign
management
which
perhaps
understands
the

better
,
"
Erdei	B	Erdei	--NME--	PERSON
added
.

"
Cofinec	B	Cofinec	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
is
a
very
good
story
in
the
long-term
as
the
per
capita
packaging
consumption
is
still
so
low
in
east
Europe	B	Europe	Q46	LOCATION
that
a
very
strong
increase
can
be
expected
(
long-term
)
,
"
Sitanyi	B	Sitanyi	--NME--	PERSON
said
,
saying
that
several
recent
moves
by
Cofinec	B	Cofinec	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
boosted
its
position
.

Among
them
,
he
noted
that
Cofinec	B	Cofinec	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
had
acquired
the
outstanding
stake
in
its
Czech	B	Czech	Q213	MISC
folding
company
Krpaco	B	Krpaco a.s.	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
a.s.	I	Krpaco a.s.	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
,
increasing
its
ownership
to
100
percent
,
so
in
the
second
half
the
whole
of
Krpaco	B	Krpaco	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
's
figures
will
be
consolidated
.

The
company
also
repaid
some
$
21
million
of
debt
,
well
above
the
originally
planned
$
8
million
to
$
9
million
.

In
addition
,
its
Polish	B	Polish	Q36	MISC
operation
began
with
some
six
weeks
of
delay
due
to
cold
winter
weather
and
the
test
run
was
also
longer
than
planned
.

Yeltsin	B	Yeltsin	Q34453	PERSON
,

has
kept
a
low
profile
since
he
was
reelected
in
July
,
prompting
new
speculation
that
the
two
heart
attacks
he
suffered
last
year

a
rumoured
drinking
problem
could
be
taking
their
toll

weakening
his

dismissed
such
speculation

insisting
that
he
simply
needs
a

appears
to

His

not
been
spelled

Under

constitution
agreed
in

the

no

only
political
role

smoothe

functioning

But
Meri	B	Meri	Q153149	PERSON

67

has
been
accused
in
parliament
of
taking
too
much
power
and
not
always
consulting
parliamentarians
before
making
decisions
.

His
relations
with
a
leftist-led
government
have
sometimes
been
tense

His
support
in
the
first
round
of
voting
on
Monday
was
much
lower
than
expected
,
scoring
only
45
votes
,
which
political
analysts
put
down
as
a
vote
of
no
confidence
in
his
performance
.

This
support
only
inched
up
to
49

the
second
vote

Support
for
Ruutel	B	Ruutel	Q194000	PERSON
,
68

remained
constant

give
either
Meri	B	Meri	Q153149	PERSON

Commission	I	Securities and Exchange Commission	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
Wednesday
approved
rules
designed
to
give
stock
market
investors
a
better
chance
at
getting
the
best
price
available
for
their
orders
.

The
so-called
order
handling
rules
,
which
were
proposed
last
September
,
were
approved
in
a
4-0
vote
.

The
new
rules
will
require
specialists
at
stock
exchanges
and
market
makers
on
Nasdaq	B	Nasdaq	Q82059	MISC
to
allow
customers
to
view
price
quotes
from
other
electronic
trading
systems
that
may
not
be
readily
available
to
them
.

The
rules
will
also
require
that
customer
limit
orders
be
displayed
with
prices
better
than
those
available
in
quotes
publicly
available
at
the
time
.

Specialists
and
market
makers
are
companies
or
individuals
recognised
as
qualified
to
maintain
an
orderly
market
in
a
stock
.

In
a
limit
order
,
investors
specify
the
price
at
which
they
are
willing
to
buy
or
sell
,
as
opposed
to
a
market
order
executed
at
prevailing
prices
.

"
These
rules
are
intended
to
empower
all
investors
,
by
allowing
their
orders
to
compete
on
a
level
playing
field
,
and
by
providing
the
disclosure
they
need
to
make
informed
decisions
,

said
SEC	B	SEC	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
Chairman
Arthur	B	Arthur Levitt	Q4799509	PERSON
Levitt	I	Arthur Levitt	Q4799509	PERSON
.

The
SEC	B	SEC	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
's
goal
,
he
added
,
was
to
create
"
one
system
where
one
price
could
be
available
to
everybody
.

firms
will
probably
need
to
spend
about
$
7
million
to
carry
out
the
improvements
called
for
by
the
new
rules
.

In
proposing
the
rules
last
year
,
the
SEC	B	SEC	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
noted
that
while
technology
has
improved
,
commonplace
practices
still
existed
that
worked
against
investors
'
best
interests
.

It
noted
that
customers
whose
orders
were
not
displayed
lost
the
chance
of
getting
the
best
possible
price
available
in
the
market
.

It
also
cited
the
potential
problem
of
a
two-tiered
market
in
which
market
makers
quote
one
price
to
public
investors
while
quoting
better
prices
in
private
systems
,
thus
robbing
investors
without
access
to
"
hidden
"
quotes
the
benefit
of
the
best
available
prices
.

Earlier
this
month
,
the
SEC	B	SEC	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
settled
charges
of

agreed
to

$
100
million
over
five
years
to
upgrade
its
oversight
of
brokers
'
trading
practices
.

The
SEC	B	SEC	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
dropped
a
third
proposal
that
would
have
allowed
investors
with
market
orders
to
trade
at
a
better
price
if
there
were
shifts
in
prices
before
their
orders
were
executed
.

The
agency
said
it
would
monitor
effects
of
the
two
new
rules
before
considering
the
"
price
improvement
"
proposal
again
.

The
agency
also
proposed
rule
changes
that
would
require
continuous
"
bid
"
and
"
ask
"
quotations
from
exchange
specialists
and
market
makers
who
trade
more
than
1
percent
of
a
stock
during
any
quarter
on
Nasdaq	B	Nasdaq	Q82059	MISC
.

The
SEC	B	SEC	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
's
limit
order

rule
will
mean
a
major
change
for
Nasdaq	B	Nasdaq	Q82059	MISC

Andrei	B	Andrei Medvedev	Q355338	PERSON
Medvedev	I	Andrei Medvedev	Q355338	PERSON
exchanged
his
reputation
as
the
clown
prince
of
tennis
on
Wednesday
for
a
new
no-nonsense
attitude
that
has
made
life
on
the
courts
fun
again
.

"
I
think
I
'm
much
more
focused
on
what
I
have
to
do
,
and
that
's
playing
tennis
,
"

of

Open	I	U.S. Open	Q123577	MISC
.

It
was
Medvedev	B	Medvedev	Q355338	PERSON
's
sixth
victory
in
a
row
after
winning
his
first
tournament
of
the
year
last
week
at
the
Hamlet	B	Hamlet Cup	Q203273	MISC
Cup	I	Hamlet Cup	Q203273	MISC
.

"
I
realised
this
year
,
that
without
putting
99.9
percent
of
your
mind
into
tennis
,
I
do
n't
think
you
can
successful
,
"
said
the
22-year-old
Medvedev	B	Medvedev	Q355338	PERSON
.

"
The
whole
day
I
'm
thinking
abnout
tennis
.

I
felt
that
all
the
other
things
I
was
doing
the
years
before
,
they
were
distracting
me
,
they
were
not
helping
me
at
all
.
"

For
Medvedev	B	Medvedev	Q355338	PERSON
that
meant
confining
his
post-match
comments
to
tennis
and
not
going
off
on
tirades
about
about
peripheral
issues
such
as
the
poor
quality
of
food
in
the
players
lounge
,
an
entertaining
rant
that
took
his
mind
off
the
task
at
hand
.

"
I
know
what
I
'm
here
for
,
"
said
Medvedev	B	Medvedev	Q355338	PERSON
,
who
lost
in
the
second
round
of
the
Open	B	Open	--NME--	MISC
the
last
two
years
after
reaching
the
quarters
in
1993
,
the
same
year
he
tried
his
hand
as
a
restaurant
critic
.

"
I
'm
not
here
to
fight
the
press
or
talk
about
the
food
or
entertain
the
people
off
the
court
.

I
'm
here
to
play
tennis
and
to
win
.

I
have
much
less
fun
off
the
court
.

I
have
much
more
fun
on
the
court
,
"
he
said
.

Just
three
years
ago
Medvedev	B	Medvedev	Q355338	PERSON
was
one
of
the
world
's
best
,
with
a
ranking
of
six
after
reaching
the
French	B	French Open	Q43605	MISC
Open	I	French Open	Q43605	MISC
semifinal
and
winning
three
tournaments
.

But
Medvedev	B	Medvedev	Q355338	PERSON
's
ranking
slowly
began
to
drop
last
year
as
he
struggled
with
a
wrist
injury
.

The
Ukrainian	B	Ukrainian	Q212	MISC
finally
hit
a
low
of
44th
two
months
ago
.

"
It
's
somewhere
where
I
would
n't
like
to
stay
very
long
,
"
Medvedev	B	Medvedev	Q355338	PERSON
said
of
his
current
ranking
of
36
.
"

It
's
a
part
of
the
penalty
that
I
have
to
accept
.
"

As
part
of
his
new
businesslike
approach
,
Medvedev	B	Medvedev	Q355338	PERSON
hired
Australian	B	Australian	Q408	MISC
coach
Bob	B	Bob Brett	Q2907592	PERSON
Brett	I	Bob Brett	Q2907592	PERSON
at

"
At
the

we
started

While
Medvedev	B	Medvedev	Q355338	PERSON
's
77-minute
romp
past
Fleurian	B	Fleurian	Q964112	PERSON
was
rather
ordinary
,
the
fact
that
the
two
were
playing
each
other
was
rather
remarkable
.

In
the
original
draw
,
Medvedev	B	Medvedev	Q355338	PERSON
and
Fleurian	B	Fleurian	Q964112	PERSON
were
slotted
to
play
each
other
.

When
controversy
forced
the
draw
to
be
done
over
--
against
odds
of
151-to-1
--
Medvedev	B	Medvedev	Q355338	PERSON
and
Fleurian	B	Fleurian	Q964112	PERSON
drew
each
other
a
second
time
.

"
When
I
saw
the
new
draw
I
did
n't
have
to
change
my
preparation
,
"
Medvedev	B	Medvedev	Q355338	PERSON
said
.
"

I
think
it
's
destined
that
it
turned
out
for
me
.

he
had
received

from
Botha	B	Botha	Q212286	PERSON
in
compiling
his
party
's
report
.

Since
it
began
work
in

the
commission
has
been
hearing
harrowing
tales
from
the
victims
of
apartheid-era
abuses
,
by
both
the
white
minority
regime
and
its
opponents
.

It
also
wants
to
hear
from
those
who
committed
the
abuses
,
to
whom
it
can
offer
amnesty
in
return
for
frankness
.

Hopes
that
reformed
perpetrators
would
come
forward
voluntarily
have
faded
but
the
commission
has
the
legal
power
to
force
them
to
appear
.

Allen	B	Allen	--NME--	PERSON
declined
to
give

who
would
be
subpoenaed
.

"
At

is
a
smaller
reduction
in

than
was
sought
by

Nevertheless
I
am
satisfied
that
the

BERLIN	B	BERLIN	Q64	LOCATION
1996-08-28

Berlin	B	Berlin	Q64	LOCATION
prosecutors
said
on
Wednesday
they
had
filed
charges
against
two
German	B	German	Q183	MISC
men
for
sexually
abusing
children
in
Thailand	B	Thailand	Q869	LOCATION
and
distributing
pornographic
films
and
pictures
of
their
degrading
acts
.

The
case
is
one
of
only
a
handful
in
which
authorities
have
managed
to
track
down
suspects
under
a
law
which
lets
them
pursue
Germans	B	Germans	Q183	MISC
who
commit
sex
offences
abroad
.

The
pair
,
identified
only
as
43-year-old
clerk
Dieter	B	Dieter U	--NME--	PERSON
U	I	Dieter U	--NME--	PERSON
and
businessman
Thomas	B	Thomas S	--NME--	PERSON
S	I	Thomas S	--NME--	PERSON
,
33
,
are
alleged
to
have
carried
out
acts
of
sexual
indecency
with
children
as
young
as
10
years
old
between
1994
and
1995
.

Their
videos
included
pictures
of
one
of
the
accused
tying
up
a
Thai	B	Thai	Q869	MISC
boy
and
performing
acts
of
sadistic
torture
on
him
,
prosecutors
said
in
a
statement
.

In
another
scene
,
a
young
girl
performed
oral
sex
with
an
unidentified
adult
man
.

The
new
law
was
introduced
with
much
fanfare
in
1993
.

But
prosecutors
face
huge
difficulties
in
gathering
evidence
and
bringing
witnesses
to
testify
in
a
German	B	German	Q183	MISC
court
,
and
only
one
person
has
so
far
been
convicted
under
the
law
.

Investigators
are
probing
several
other
cases
.

The
Berlin	B	Berlin	Q64	LOCATION
prosecutors
said
they
had
been
alerted
to
the
two
men
by
customs
officials
who
intercepted
packages
containing
pornographic
photographs
and
order
forms
.

the

edition
of
the
world
's
biggest
tomato
fight
began
in
the
eastern
Spanish	B	Spanish	Q29	MISC
village
of
Bunol	B	Bunol	Q853762	LOCATION
.

Thousands
of
people
pelted
each
other
with
armfuls
of
ripe
tomatoes
as
streets
,
walls
and
windows
were
coated
in
a
blood-red
wash
.

A
single
firework
after
midday
signalled
the
start
of
the
fruit-throwing
frenzy
,
during
which
participants
hurl
some
100
tonnes
of
tomatoes
trucked
in
for
the
occasion
.

Local
historians
say
the
tradition
began
in
1945
when
disgruntled
locals
began
spontaneously
to
bombard
the
priest

at

money
market
gained
slightly
at
Wednesday
's
close
after
what
dealers
described
as
a
see-saw
trading
session
.

Ninety-day
bank
bill
rates
shed
five
points
to
9.93
percent
and
September
bank
bill
futures
rose
four
to
90.18
.

However
,
bonds
finished
largely
flat
.

"
Our
bonds
were
better
bid
initially
but
they
sold
off
on
a
lack
of
demand
,
and
the
short
end
went
with
it
too
on
a
lower
currency
.

"
There
were
big
buyers
at
the
base

where
the

sold
to
,
and
when
the
currency
got
bought
back
on
talk

the
market
got
bought
back
again
,
"
a
dealer
said
.

Volumes
were
reasonable
in
the
money
market
but
thin
in
bonds
.

Dealers
said
the
market
seemed
to
be
trading
a
range
and
would
wait
for
more
political
polls
to
provide
direction
.

They
were
confident
of
further

but
said
the
timing
was
less

BRUSSELS	B	BRUSSELS	Q240	LOCATION
1996-08-29

The
European	B	European Commission	Q8880	ORGANIZATION
Commission	I	European Commission	Q8880	ORGANIZATION
said
on
Thursday
it
would
study
scientific
reports
saying
Britain	B	Britain	Q145	LOCATION
's
mad
cow
epidemic
would
die
out
by
2001
but
offered
little
prospect
the
findings
would
change
an
agreed
slaughter
campaign
.

"
Obviously
we
are
interested
in
this
research
.

We
will
ask
the
(
EU	B	EU	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
)
scientific
and
veterinary
committee
to
examine
it
,
"
Commission	B	Commission	Q8880	ORGANIZATION
spokesman
Gerard	B	Gerard Kiely	--NME--	PERSON
Kiely	I	Gerard Kiely	--NME--	PERSON
told
Reuters	B	Reuters	Q130879	ORGANIZATION
.

But
he
added
that
new
research
into
the
dynamics
of
the
bovine
spongiform
encephalopathy
(
BSE	B	BSE	Q154666	MISC
)
,
a
fatal
brain-wasting
disease
suffered
by
cattle
,
was
unlikely
to
alter
a
slaughter
plan
agreed
by
Britain	B	Britain	Q145	LOCATION
and
its
14
EU	B	EU	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
partners
.

"
We
agreed
that
following
detailed
scientific
analysis
using
a
methodology
which
would
take
out
the
maximum
number
of
BSE	B	BSE	Q154666	MISC
cases
possible
.

I
think
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
sell
to
the
European	B	European Commission	Q8880	ORGANIZATION
Commission	I	European Commission	Q8880	ORGANIZATION
a
programme
which
would
involve
the
elimination
of
fewer
BSE	B	BSE	Q154666	MISC
cases
,
"
Kiely	B	Kiely	--NME--	PERSON
said
.

"
We
will
look
at
our
approach
(
to
the
plan
)
but
we
wo
n't
get
involved
with
the
number
of
animals
to
be
slaughtered
,
"
he
said
.

"
We
have
always
avoided
the
question
of
numbers
of
animals
to
be
slaughtered
,
that
's
not
the
issue
.

The
issue
is
the
protection
of
consumers
'
health
and
the
rapid
eradication
of
BSE	B	BSE	Q154666	MISC
,
"
he
added
.

The
reaction
is
likely
to
disappoint
British	B	British	Q145	MISC
farmers
,
who
seized
on
research
by
Oxford	B	Oxford	Q34433	ORGANIZATION
scientists
in
the
scientific
journal
Nature	B	Nature	Q180445	ORGANIZATION
saying
it
would
be
hard
to
get
rid
of
the
disease
any
faster
than
2001
without
killing
vast
numbers
of
cattle
.

The
researchers
predicted
there
would
be
340
new
infections
and
14,000
new
cases
of
BSE	B	BSE	Q154666	MISC
before
2001
.

British	B	British	Q145	MISC
farmers
'
leader
called
on
Wednesday
for
an
urgent
meeting
with
ministers
to
discuss
the
report
.

"
I
hope
the
government
will
now
make
it
clear
they
believe
there
is
a
better
way
of
dealing
with
this
issue
,

Naish	B	Naish	--NME--	PERSON
said
there
was
no
need
for
Britain	B	Britain	Q145	LOCATION
to
carry
out
a
planned
cull
of
some
147,000
cattle
to
which
it
had
reluctantly
agreed
to
placate
its
European	B	European	Q458	MISC
partners
.

"
The
new
evidence
to
me
means
some
of
that
proposal
should
be
re-examined
because
we
could
get
away
with
considerably
less
animals
being
culled
if
in
fact
scientists
throughout
Europe	B	Europe	Q46	LOCATION
accepted
this
evidence
,
"
Naish	B	Naish	--NME--	PERSON
said
.

The
report
could
well
reopen
a
damaging
row
between
Britain	B	Britain	Q145	LOCATION
and
the
EU	B	EU	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
,
which
slapped
a
worldwide
ban
on
British	B	British	Q145	MISC

after
the

said
there
could
be
a
link
between
BSE	B	BSE	Q154666	MISC
and
the
human
form
of
the
disease
.

The
issue
flared
in

Medical
Centre
said
in
a
release
.

Muscular
dystrophy
is
a
fatal
illness
in
which
the
body
's
muscle
tissue
degenerates
and
is
replaced
by
fat
.

Death
strikes
in
early
adulthood
.

Individuals
with
the
disease
have
a
non-working
version
of
a
gene
responsible
for
producing
a
crucial
muscle
protein
called
dystrophin
.

In
the
study
at
the
University
's
Institute	B	Institute for Human Gene Therapy	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
for	I	Institute for Human Gene Therapy	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
Human	I	Institute for Human Gene Therapy	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
Gene	I	Institute for Human Gene Therapy	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
Therapy	I	Institute for Human Gene Therapy	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
,
researchers
altered
a
common-cold
virus
to
carry
a
version
of
the
working
dystrophin
gene
.

The
virus
,
which
also
was
altered
to
minimise
its
susceptibility
to
the
immune
system
,
was
then
injected
into
the
muscle
cells
of
mice
bred
to
lack
dystrophin
genes
.

In
the
experiment
,
between
30
to
40
percent
of
the
muscle
fibers
in
one
group
of
mice
produced
dystrophin
for
two
weeks
before
diminishing
.

Similar
results
had
been
obtained
previously
in
test-tube
cell
cultures
,
but
not
in
live
animals
,
the
university
said
.

The
university
said
methods
are
still
needed
to
make
enough
of
the
altered
virus
to
treat
humans
,
to
further
decrease
the
immune-system
response
to
the
virus
,
and
to
deliver
the
virus
to
human
muscle
tissue
.

said
on
Thursday
he
was
financially
broken
by
his
defence
against
murder
charges
but
he
was
hopeful
new
evidence
to
support
him
would
be
available
for
a
civil
trial
next

.

The
former
football
star
was
found
not
guilty
by

jury
last

in

.

He
now
faces
a
civil
suit
brought
by
families
of
the
victims
who
hold
him
responsible
for
the
deaths
.

He
told
reporters
a
court
order
not
to
talk
about
his
case
kept
him
from
detailing
how
he
has
fulfilled
his
pledge
to
find
the
killers
.

But
he
added
without
elaborating
,
"
hopefully
we
will
see
some
things
come
out
in
this
next
trial
.
"

The
judge
in
the
civil
trial
has
imposed
a
sweeping
gag
order
that
prohibits
lawyers
,
witnesses
and
parties
to
the
case
from
discussing
it
with
the

or
elsewhere
in

"
I

said
Simpson	B	Simpson	Q44473	PERSON
,
who
vowed
after
his
acquittal
to
find
the
killers
and
offered
a
substantial
reward
.

His
lawyers
have
said
his
defence
in
the
civil
trial
that
starts
Sept
.

17
will
be
that
he
did
not
kill
the
victims
.

Simpson	B	Simpson	Q44473	PERSON
said
at
the
hotel
news
conference
his
plans
include
eventually
writing
another
book

He
added
that
he
has
had
job
offers
but
more
have
come
from
abroad
than
at

.

"
I
'm
broke

I
am
not
crying

I
can
get
along
just
fine
,
"
he
said
.
"

Whatever
you
want
to
send
me
,
I
need
.
"

He
again
accused
the
news
media
of
erroneous
reporting
on
his
case
but
did
not
signal
any
plans
for
lawsuits
as
he
did
on

in
an

at

Contrary
to

reports
,
Simpson	B	Simpson	Q44473	PERSON
said
,
he
has
received
support
from
both

again
dismissed

that

himself
from
the
black

during
his
successful
football
and
commercial
career
,
only
to
seek

jumped
23
percent
Thursday
on
the
expectation
the
company
would
emerge
as
a
smaller
but
more
profitable
operation
after
its
planned
exit
from
the
computer
modem
business
.

The
San	B	San Jose	Q16553	LOCATION
Jose	I	San Jose	Q16553	LOCATION
,
Calif.	B	Calif.	Q99	LOCATION
,
company
was
up
2-1/8
at
11-3/8
after
its
announcement
Wednesday
that
it
planned
to
pull
out
of
the
highly
competitive
modem-chip
business
and
focus
instead
on
the
fast-growing
market
for
computer
networking
equipment
.

"
Certainly
the
company
will
be
a
much
smaller
company
now
,
but
it
will
be
a
more
profitable
business
,
"

Co	I	Roberston Stephens & Co	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
.

But
analysts
noted
that
Sierra	B	Sierra	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
still
has
much
painful
work
ahead
of
it
,
including
cutting
as
many
as
150
jobs
from
its
workforce
,
which
currently
has
500
people
,
and
building
up
the
business
of
its
PMC-Sierra	B	PMC-Sierra	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
unit
,
which
makes
routing
devices
and
chipsets
for
high-speed
computer
networks
.

The
company
has
announced
plans
to
take
a
charge
against
earnings
of
$
50
million
to
$
80
million
to
write
down
the
value
of
assets

inventories
and
cover

.

said
the
company
likely
would
have
difficulty
selling
its
modem-chip
business
.

"
Once
you
announce
your
intention
to
exit
a
business
,
it
becomes
a
complete
buyer
's
market
,
"
he
said
.

And
he
said
that
while
the
company
is
focusing
on
the
fastest-growing
part
of
its
business
,
the
market
for
networking
chips
has
begun
to
attract
the
attention
of
much-larger
players
such
as
International	B	International Business Machines Corp	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
Business	I	International Business Machines Corp	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
Machines	I	International Business Machines Corp	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
Corp	I	International Business Machines Corp	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
.

"
As
the
market
develops
the
question
is
,
are
they
able
to
make
that
transition
to
be
a
much
larger
company
?
"

Randall	B	Randall	--NME--	PERSON
said
.

Other
analysts
were
more
bullish
,
even
though
the
company
is
expected
to
shrink
to
slightly
more
than
half
its
current
size
in
sales
.

"
It
's
a
positive
strategic
move
,

"
The
modem
business
is
a
low-margin
,
commodity
business
,
"
he
said
.

The
company
's
PMC-Sierra	B	PMC-Sierra	Q7119723	ORGANIZATION
unit
generated
$
33
million
of
the
company
's
$
117
million
in
sales
in
the
first
half
of
the
year
,
compared
with
$
45
million
in
sales
of
modem
chips
,
Kan	B	Kan	--NME--	PERSON
said
.

But
the
PMC	B	PMC	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
unit
is
far
more
profitable
,
he
said
.

Sierra	B	Sierra	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
's
stock
has
fallen
from
a
high
of
nearly
$
25
this
year
as
the
computer

has
been
battered
by
falling
prices
and
concern
about
slowing
demand
.

They

have
widened

,
and
are
likely
to
remain
strong
in

"
On
the
jet
kerosene
side
we
must
be
cautious
about
quality
.

Some
are
commanding
a
very
good
premium
of
95
cents
to
one
dollar
.

It
's
been
99
cents
to
Korea	B	Korea	Q18097	LOCATION
.

This
will
stay
at
this
sort
of
price
premium
for
a
while
,
"
one
said
.

"
But
for
normal
jet
the
weakened
demand
is
quite
noticeable
,
the
premium
is
around
45-50
cents
.

The
differential
is
not
normally
as
wide
as
this
,
"
he
added
.

Another
put
the
premium
for
jet
kerosene
at
between
65
and
75
cents
.

One
trader
said
despite
the
fact
that
some
kerosene
was
in
storage
at
Dubai	B	Dubai	Q612	LOCATION
ports
,
demand
looked
to
exceed
supply

up

Dealers
expected

to
stick
around
current
levels
for
the
next
two

three

,
before
they
get
a
boost
in

"
said

"

the

whether
they

out

"
he
added
.

India	B	India	Q668	LOCATION

120,000

I

still
suspicious
that

buy
more

,
"
another
said

But
traders
see
the
market
remaining
tight
in
the
short-term
,
with
some
surplus
arising
closer
to
October
.

"
I
see
an
overhang

gas
oil
further
out
,
"
one
said

"
Gas
oil
will
remain
tight
in

up

with
the
premium
of
around
$
1
for
0.5

.

In
the
second
half

October
we
see

Traders
said
there

Looking

he

I

our

is
that
it

probably

rather
mixed

's
been

"
It

when
T&N	B	T&N	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
predicted
a
sluggish
first
half
and
a
rebound
later
in

,
Hope	B	Hope	--NME--	PERSON
said
:
"
I
think
the
difference
(
now
)
is
the
first
half
has
not
actually
been
as
bad
as
some
felt
it
was
going
to
be
,
but
equally
we
're
certainly
not
predicting
a
recovery
in
the
second
half
.
"

Against
this
background
,
Hope	B	Hope	--NME--	PERSON
said
the
group
was
glad
it
had
rationalised
and
destocked
even
though
this
had
pressed

had
slipped
to
9.5
percent

percent
a

"
I
think
the
figure
of
9.5
percent
on
the
first
half
,
when
you
consider
the
fact
that
we
've
been
destocking
,
the
fairly
mixed
customer
demand
,
and
the
fact
that
we
sold
the
(
southern
African	B	African	Q15	MISC

actually
is
not
bad
.

"
It
does
show
how
easily
we
should
be
able
to
bounce
back
over
10
percent
again
,
"
he
added
,
saying
:
"
We
continue
to
feel
very
relaxed
about
our
general
view
that
we
would
average
10
percent
profit
margins
over
the
cycle
.
"

"
We
've
always
taken
the
view
that
we
are
the
sort
of
company
that
's
quite
capable
of
working
in
difficult
circumstances
--
we
're
rather
used

it

And
we
feel
very
confident
that
we
're
doing
all
the
right
things
,
"
Hope	B	Hope	--NME--	PERSON
said
.

"
When
the

will
bounce
back
up

is
just
a

recovering
just
a
fraction

The

emerged
as
a
hot
topic
on
Wall	B	Wall Street	Q11690	LOCATION

since
Rubin	B	Rubin	Q370316	PERSON

been
his
unflagging

Speculation

not
stay
in

grew
after
he
sidestepped
questions
about

Anyone

Fear
that
a
new
Treasury	B	Treasury	Q648666	ORGANIZATION
secretary
might
favour
a
return
to
Bentsen-era	B	Bentsen-era	--NME--	MISC
policy
could
spell
trouble
for
financial
markets
.

Some
overseas
investors
might
shy
away
from
buying
U.S.	B	U.S.	Q30	LOCATION
stocks
and
bonds
or
even
sell
them
when

is
weakening

Treasury	I	U.S. Treasury	Q648666	ORGANIZATION

's
reappointment
as

were
more
important
than
whether
Rubin	B	Rubin	Q370316	PERSON
continues
at
the
Treasury	B	Treasury	Q648666	ORGANIZATION
.

"
Although
,
if
we
did
get
someone
that
was
seen
as
looking
for
a
dollar
depreciation
,
it
would
probably
hurt
capital
flows
to
the
United	B	United States	Q30	LOCATION
States	I	United States	Q30	LOCATION
,
"
said
Widness	B	Widness	--NME--	PERSON
,
adding
that
could
hurt
U.S.	B	U.S.	Q30	LOCATION
stocks
and
,
to
a
lesser
degree
,
bonds
.

Still
,
markets
may
have
little
to
fear
from
any
Rubin	B	Rubin	Q370316	PERSON
successor
because
the
firm
dollar
policy
has
yielded
positive
results
.

If
that
is
true
,
then
any
new
Treasury	B	Treasury	Q648666	ORGANIZATION
chief
would
need
to
be
as
effective
as

in
convincing
markets
that
the
White	B	White House	Q35525	LOCATION
House	I	White House	Q35525	LOCATION
does
indeed
want
a
strong

.

"
If
he
left
,
the
first
question
people
would
ask
the
next
guy
is
,
'
What
's
your
view
on

"
And
all
I
can
say
as
a
piece
of
advice
is
that
they
'd
better
say
exactly
the
same
thing

in

charging
back

"

fired
up

The

netted

found
the
net
with
another
backhand
from

.

"
You
just
kind

fighting

you
keep
trying

make

I

he

higher

this

the

Analysts

which
already

the

the
economy
without
scaring
the
socks
off

"
The

I
do
n't

it

the
collapse

unless
the
rise

touches
off
a
dynamic
within
the
market
,
which
would
include
selling
by
portfolio
managers
,
redemptions
by

mutual

that
would

pressure

This

the

weighed
Dole	B	Dole	Q319079	PERSON

lower

taxes

15
percent

a

Clinton	B	Clinton	Q1124	PERSON
proposes

would
spare

Clinton	B	Clinton	Q1124	PERSON

while
the

said
some
corporate

plan
.

The
experts
said
there
are
some
unusual
risks
for
the
market
from
this
year
's
political
season
because
the
rush
to
promise
tax
cuts
to
win

could
upset

a

The
trick

they

will
be
for

continue
to
convince

Johnson	B	Johnson	--NME--	PERSON
said
that
long-term

already
been
spooked

.

The
long-term
bond
jumped
this
week
to
7.13
percent
after
starting
the
year
at
5.95

The
surge
of
buying

has
come
amid
an
environment
of
low

"
said
Geraghty	B	Geraghty	--NME--	PERSON

He
said
the

reflects
the
political
uncertainty
,
now
that
Dole	B	Dole	Q319079	PERSON
has
sharply
narrowed
the
gap
with
Clinton	B	Clinton	Q1124	PERSON
in
the

Geraghty	B	Geraghty	--NME--	PERSON
said
that
the
one
thing
that
could
completely
turn

there

that

strong

The
Agriculture	B	Agriculture Department	Q501542	ORGANIZATION
Department	I	Agriculture Department	Q501542	ORGANIZATION
proposed
more
than
a
year
ago
to
significantly
ease
an
82-year
ban
on
Mexican	B	Mexican	Q96	MISC
avocados
.

Under
the
administration
's
proposal
,
the
borders
to
the
Mexican	B	Mexican	Q96	MISC
produce
would
be
opened
into
19
Northern
and
Northeastern
states
from
November
through
February
.

The
plan
has
raised
a
storm
of
protest
from
U.S.	B	U.S.	Q30	LOCATION
avocado
growers
,
who
are
largely
concentrated
in
California	B	California	Q99	LOCATION
.

California	B	California	Q99	LOCATION
growers
have
charged
that
removing
the
restrictions
,
even
on
a
limited
basis
,
would
endanger
the
$
1
billion
U.S.	B	U.S.	Q30	LOCATION
industry
if
potentially
harmful
Mexican	B	Mexican	Q96	MISC
insects
were
brought
into
the
country
along
with
the
avocados
.

Mexican	B	Mexican	Q96	MISC
officials
contend
that
there
is
no
scientific
basis
for
the
ban
,
and
that
it
is
illegal
under
international
trading
rules
of
the
World	B	World Trade Organisation	Q7825	ORGANIZATION
Trade	I	World Trade Organisation	Q7825	ORGANIZATION
Organisation	I	World Trade Organisation	Q7825	ORGANIZATION
.

Proponents
of
the
plan
discount
the
worries
of
the
U.S.	B	U.S.	Q30	LOCATION
growers
and
say
the
plan
has
enough
safeguards
built
into
it
to
eliminate
any
significant
threat
to
American	B	American	Q30	MISC
producers
.

Under
the
proposal
,
only
imports
of
export-quality
avocados
growing
in
approved
orchards
in
Michoacan	B	Michoacan	Q79861	LOCATION
,
Mexico	B	Mexico	Q96	LOCATION

new

submitted
to
the

the
pest
problem
in
Mexico	B	Mexico	Q96	LOCATION
and
have
urged
that
the
agency
reopen
its
study
of
the
issue
.

The
administration
is
still
studying
the
new
data
,
and
officials
have
said
that
if
experts
think
the
information
is
significant
,
the

could
reopen

investigation

said
that
while

may
have
delayed
the
plan
for
a
while
,
they
ultimately
do
not
expect
the
administration
to
change
its
position
.

"
From
a
common-sense
view
,
the
department
should
reconsider
this
plan

due
to
politics
they
will
probably
go
ahead

this

underwent
extensive
surgery
for
pancreatic

followed

"
On

In

left

saying
he

his

have
told
him
there
was
only
a
slim
chance

the
liver
cancer
was
inoperable

"
It
's
not

Death

some

Pancreatic
cancer

deadly
forms

the
disease

Bernardin	B	Bernardin	Q744108	PERSON

Surgeons
removed
a
cancerous
kidney

parts

his
pancreas

small

bile
duct
and
surrounding
tissues
.

He
made
a
rapid
recovery
and
resumed
most
of
his
duties
,
but
then
developed
a
deteriorating
condition
in
his
spine
that
caused
him
great
pain
and
shortened
his
height
by
several
inches
.

He
was
scheduled
to
undergo
back
surgery
next
month
,
but
that
was
cancelled
when
the
cancer
was
discovered
in
his
liver
in
order
to
avoid
delaying
the
start

Glenn	B	Glenn Somerville	--NME--	PERSON
Somerville	I	Glenn Somerville	--NME--	PERSON

WASHINGTON	B	WASHINGTON	Q61	LOCATION
1996-08-30

Consumer
spending
barely
edged
up
in
July
,
the
Commerce	B	Commerce Department	Q503577	ORGANIZATION
Department	I	Commerce Department	Q503577	ORGANIZATION
said
Friday
,
as
income
growth
slowed
abruptly
to
the
weakest
pace
in
six
months
.

Spending
rose
0.2
percent
to
a
seasonally
adjusted
annual
rate
of
$
5.15
trillion
after
dropping
a
revised
0.4
percent
in
June
.

Incomes
from
wages
,
salaries
and
all
other
sources
gained
0.1
percent
to
a
rate
of
$
6.47
trillion
after
a
0.9
percent
jump
in
June
.

Department
officials
said
July
's
slight
gain
in
incomes
was
the
weakest
for
any
month
since
January
,
when
they
were
flat
.

Wages
and
salaries
came
under
pressure
in
July
as
a
shorter
average
workweek
and
lower
hourly
earnings
cut
into
paychecks
.

The
department
said
wages
and
salaries
decreased
by
$
6.9
billion
in
July
after
climbing
$
45
billion
in
June
.

"
In
July
,
average
weekly
hours
and
average
hourly
earnings
declined
,
more
than
offsetting
the
effect
of
an
increase
in
employment
,
"
Commerce	B	Commerce	Q503577	ORGANIZATION
said
.

But
more
money
went
into
savings
accounts
,
as
savings
held
at
5.3
cents
out
of
each
dollar
earned
in
both
June
and
July
.

That
was
the
highest
savings
rate
since
October
last
year
,
when
5.5
cents
out
of
each
dollar
earned
was
being
saved
.

The
generally
lackluster
report
on
spending
and
incomes
in
July
had
been
expected
.

At
the
same
time
,
the
department
said
in
a
separate
report
that
new
orders
received
by
U.S.	B	U.S.	Q30	LOCATION
factories
climbed
strongly
in
July
,
with
widespread
gains
across
most
major
categories
.

Orders
increased
1.8
percent
to
a
seasonally
adjusted
$
317.6
billion
,
significantly
stronger
than
the
1
percent
rise
forecast
by
Wall	B	Wall Street	Q13677	LOCATION
Street	I	Wall Street	Q13677	LOCATION
economists
.

That
followed
a
revised
0.7
percent
decline
in
June
orders
.

Commerce
said
previously
that
spending
at
retail
stores
was
up
only
0.1
percent
in
July
,
partly
because
of
softer
sales
of
new
cars
and
light
trucks
.

In
addition
,
the
Labour	B	Labour Department	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
Department	I	Labour Department	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
's
July
employment
report
had
foreshadowed
the
muted
income
growth
.

It
showed
average
hourly
earnings
fell
in
July
by
0.2
percent
to
$
11.00
and
the
average
workweek
shortened
to
34.3
hours
from
34.7
in
June
.

Gains
in
personal
income
,
which
includes
wages
and
salaries
as
well
as
income
from
sources
such
as
dividends
,
interest
and
businesses
,
are
essential
for
funding
consumer
purchases
,
which
fuel
two-thirds
of
national
economic
activity
.

Spending
on
all
types
of
durable
goods
,
which
includes
cars
,
fell
to
an
annual
rate
of
$
626.3
billion
in
July
from
$
633.6
billion
in
June
.

But
spending
on
nondurable
products
increased
moderately
to
a
rate
of
$
1.55
trillion
from
$
1.54
trillion
in
June
,
while
spending
for
services
was
up
to
$
2.97
trillion
in
July
from
$
2.96
trillion
.

Payrolls
of
manufacturing
companies
rose
in
July
by
$
2.3
billion
to
an
annual
rate
of
$
678
billion
.

off

He
is
not

he

be

that

Jansher	B	Jansher	Q174595	PERSON
said
that
he
was
disturbed

"

What
he
did
was
bad
for

bad

bad

"
We
are

and
about

been
sentenced
,
most

In

Most

released
but
several

The

last

confirmed
the
recent
sentencing
of
nine
democracy

were

in

The
military
government
,
which
in
May
said
it
had
detained
the
politicians
to
prevent
anarchy
,
said
the
activists
were
charged
with
attempting
to
destroy
the
peace
and
stability
of
the
state
.

But
Suu	B	Suu Kyi	Q36740	PERSON
Kyi	I	Suu Kyi	Q36740	PERSON
disagreed
with
the
methods
,
saying
officials
often
arrested
NLD	B	NLD	Q849603	ORGANIZATION
supporters
in
the
middle
of
the
night
,
then
did
not
give
them
the
opportunity
to
defend
themselves
in
trials
.

"
When
our

are
tried
,
they
are
tried
in
a
very
secretive
way

not
told

Several
other
leading

in

after
crushing

,
never
recognised

"
This
lack
of
rule
of
law
is
an
indication
that
the
authorities
are
not
interested
in
fair
play
,
"
she
said
.
"

They
are
using
a
travesty
of
the

try

crush

sentence

once

they

Some

recounted

physical
abuse

"
If
there
are
any
more
instances
of
death
in
custody
it
will
be
further
proof
that
a
prison
sentence
for
political

sometimes

Automakers

Saturday
launched
a

million
safety
awareness
campaign
aimed
at
reducing
the
number
of
children
killed
accidentally
by
air

in
cars

.

Officials
said
they
will
work
with
law

agencies
,
pediatricians
and
media
to
warn
parents
about
the
dangers
that
air
bags
pose
to
children
and
adults
not
wearing
seatbelts
.

Since
1993
,
24
children
have
been
killed
by
the
explosive
force
of
automotive
air
bags
,
which
inflate
at
speeds
up
to

whether

The
auto
industry
was
about
three
to
six
years
away
from
introducing
"
smart
"
air
bags
with
the
ability
to
detect
the
size
and
position
of
an
occupant

adjust
inflation
pressures
accordingly

Current
air
bags
were
designed

halt

an

unbelted
adult

"
Rosati	B	Rosati	Q1166062	PERSON
said

Under
pressure
from

Jewish	B	Jewish	Q7325	MISC

,
Swiss	B	Swiss	Q39	MISC
government
has
devised
a
plan
to
pay
out
millions

as
a
conciliatory
gesture

the

said
the
tough

had
prevented

from
raising

which
had
added

He
said
advertising

said
the
company

investment

Some

such
a
threat
might
be
exaggerated

overcapacity

"
I
think

I
think

its

which

said
it
would
start
producing
Carlsberg	B	Carlsberg	Q113215	ORGANIZATION

but
that
Zywiec	B	Zywiec	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
's
potential
production
of
Heineken	B	Heineken	Q854383	ORGANIZATION
was
a
medium-term
possibility
rather
than
a
short-term
one
.

He
said
his

be
better
off
concentrating

its
leading
brand
,
Zywiec	B	Zywiec	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
Full	B	Full Light	--NME--	MISC

van

also
said
Zywiec	B	Zywiec	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
would

there

However
,
it
called
the

severe

.

British	B	British Airways	Q8766	ORGANIZATION

's
initial

that
"
unconditional
divestiture
of

is
unprecedented
and
if

it

It
added
that
it
would
be
"
prepared

on
Friday
said
that
it
planned
a
$
775
million
refunding
for
January
that
will
include
its
first
floating

issue
of
taxable
debt
for
European	B	European	Q46	MISC
investors
.

A
city
official

declined

explained
that
Goldman	B	Goldman, Sachs	--NME--	ORGANIZATION

,
which
this

,
proposed
the
floating
rate
issue
and
as
a
result
was
promoted
to
book
runner
for
this
offering
.

By
selling
the
floating
rate
debt
,
the
city
hopes
to
establish
a
benchmark
,
the
city
official
said
,
adding
that
it
needed
a
large
deal
to
accomplish
this
objective
.

The
city
in
late
June
sold
its
first
issue
of
Euronotes	B	Euronotes	--NME--	MISC
,
a
strategy
that
it
says
saved
it
$
500,000
in
interest
costs
,
and
it
has
been
trying
to
build
on
this
strategy
of
expanding
the
pool
of
potential
investors
since
then
.

In

,

any
deal

Fe	I	Santa Fe	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
would
be
a
"
bear

"
or
a
reluctantly
negotiated
agreement
where
the
buyer
is
not
necessarily
a
friendly
suitor
.

Newmont	B	Newmont	Q1785405	ORGANIZATION
said
the
companies
have
had
previous
contact
,
though
declined
to
detail
the
encounters
.

Analysts
predict
Santa	B	Santa Fe	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
Fe	I	Santa Fe	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
will
go
to
the
highest
bidder
,
and
that
if
a

,
Newmont	B	Newmont	Q1785405	ORGANIZATION
may
not
be
able
to

which
also
limits
its

Any

Baril	I	Maurice Baril	Q604334	PERSON
told
a

in
Nairobi	B	Nairobi	Q3870	LOCATION
his
main
concern
was
for
a
large
group
of
about
150,000
refugees
living
off
the
land
in
a
valley
about
65
km
(

west
of
the
eastern
city
of
Goma	B	Goma	Q204381	LOCATION
.

If
he
decided
it
was
necessary
and
safe
for
the
aircrew
,
he
would
not
hesitate
to
order
airdrops
of
food
for
the
refugees
,
even
against
the
wishes
of
the
government
in
Kinshasa	B	Kinshasa	Q3838	LOCATION
and
the
Zairean	B	Zairean	Q974	MISC
rebels
who
control

he

"

Kabila	I	Laurent Kabila	Q135547	PERSON
in

last

the

told
him
the
crisis
was
over
because
most
of
the
Rwandan	B	Rwandan	Q1037	MISC
refugees
have
already
gone
home
.

The
rebels
do
not
want
the
multinational
force
to
deploy
on
the
ground
,
for
fear
it
might
help
the
Zairean	B	Zairean	Q974	MISC

regain

of

area

Kinshasa	B	Kinshasa	Q3838	LOCATION

intervene
militarily

major
way

"
It
does
n't
look
as
though
they
(
airdrops
)
are
going

be
required
in
any
significant
way
because
the

But
General

said
it
would
be
premature
to
rule
out
any
course
of
action
until
he
had
more
information
.

"
We
hope
that
if
the
front
moves
forward
or
stabilises
then
we
will
have
access
(
to
the
large
group

refugees
)
with
reconnaissance
or
humanitarian
agencies
.

"
If
they
ca
n't
move
because
they
are
too
weak
,
then
we
will
probably
consider
very
seriously
using
air
delivery
means
(
airdrops
)
...It
's
complex
,
it
's
dangerous
for
the
air
crew
that
fly
in
there
and
it
will
have
to
be
absolutely
necessary
.

If
it
is
necessary
,
I
wo
n't
hesitate
to
use
it
,
"
he
said
.

Asked
if
he
would
disregard
the
objections
of
the
Zairean	B	Zairean	Q974	MISC
government
,
he
said
:
"
It
would
have
to
be
in
the
last
resort
.

It
would
have
to
mean
that
tens
of
thousands

are
in
danger
.

Do
you
think
that
I
would
have
a
conscience
problem
doing
it
or
not
at
that

?

And
my

Hakme	B	Hakme	--NME--	PERSON

"
We
believe
the

People
need
to
have

A
controlled
exchange

,
trade
liberalisation

tight

policies
have
also
dramatically
curbed
inflation

making
more
money
available

Hakme	B	Hakme	--NME--	PERSON
attributes
Brazil	B	Brazil	Q155	LOCATION
's
fascination
with

not
to
excessive
vanity
but
to
the
country
's
mix

different
races

which

create
physical
disharmonies

What
happens
is
the

"
he

Brazil	B	Brazil	Q155	LOCATION
's
most
sought-after
beauty

is
liposuction
in

sucked

,
with
about
30,000
operations
a
year
at
a
cost
of
$
3,000
to
$
4,000
each
.

Stomach
tucks
and
breast
operations
are
also
popular
since
the
tropical
climate
calls
for
flesh-baring
fashions
,
but
unlike
women
elsewhere
Brazilians	B	Brazilians	Q155	MISC
tend
to
have
breast
reductions

One
way
to
bridge

the

be
possible

In
a

Geneva	B	Geneva	Q71	LOCATION
conference
centre
built
before
the
dawn
of
the
Internet	B	Internet	Q466	MISC
,
groups
of
staid
officials
made
a
first
stab
on
Friday
at
rewriting

for
the

But
critics
at
the
first
government-level
meeting

revise
copyright
laws
in
25
years
said
the
officials
and
legislators
might
as
well
be
trying

police
the
ether
.

After
four
days
of
diplomatic
wrangling
over
procedures
,
some
600
delegates
from
nations
small
and
large
got
down
to
the
nitty-gritty
of
setting
the

for
the
first
time

Cyberspace
squabbles
overshadowed
the
debate

of
proposals
covering
literary

artistic
works

the
rights
of
performers

we

discussions
,
"
a
frustrated
Western
delegate
said
.
"

They
announced
they
will
start
evening
sessions
next
week
.
"

Attempts
by
copyright-based
industries
to
ensure
they
get
a
cut
from
online
works
led
to
a
storm
of
protests
by
Internet	B	Internet	Q466	MISC
companies
and
critics
who
say
the
pacts
would
curb
public
access
to
online
information
from

results
to
stock
prices
.

"
It
's
not
illegal
to
make

It
's

We
can
read

At

the

the
coming
medium
for
the
distribution

an

child-sex
inquiry
.

CANBERRA	B	CANBERRA	Q3114	LOCATION
1996-12-06

The
Australian	B	Australian	Q408	MISC
opposition
on
Friday
demanded
a
high-powered
investigation
into
paedophilia
in
the
Australian	B	Australian	Q408	MISC
diplomatic
service
after
the
federal
court
forced
the
head
of
the
existing
inquiry
to
stand
aside
.

The
court
said
inquiry
head
Chris	B	Chris Hunt	--NME--	PERSON
Hunt	I	Chris Hunt	--NME--	PERSON
might
be
biased
,
since
he
privately
told
a

he
had
turned
up
no
major
evidence
of
paedophile
activity
,
even
though
he
still
had
months
'
of
investigation
before
him
.

"
Today
we
are
left
with
a
ruinous
wreck

a
continuing
pall
of

But
the

responded
by
pressing
ahead
with
the
original
inquiry
,
established
in
May
,
appointing
a
new
head
to
lead
it

Critics
say

in
senior
posts
in
the
Foreign	B	Foreign Affairs Department	--NME--	ORGANIZATION
Affairs	I	Foreign Affairs Department	--NME--	ORGANIZATION

then
a

inquiry
would

.

Accordingly
,
they
demand
an

investigation

be
mobilised
to
ensure
the

run
without
a

but
the
average
Singaporean	B	Singaporean	--NME--	MISC
"
would
probably
not
be
too
concerned
about
some
of

"
Tan	B	Tan	--NME--	PERSON
said

"
But
the
more
educated

will
realise
that
these

are
important
for
Singapore	B	Singapore	Q334	LOCATION

any
political

the

get
from
the
WTO	B	WTO	Q7825	ORGANIZATION
meeting
--
ahead
of
a
general
election
due
by
April
1997
--
would
depend
on
how
successful
it
was
in
pushing
its
economic
agenda
.

"
If
there
are
any
movements
toward
freer
trade
,
then
Singapore	B	Singapore	Q334	LOCATION
's
economy
and
the
electorate
would
gain
,
"
he
said
.
"

But
I
do
n't
think
it
would
be
wise
to
play
up
the
political
aspect
of
this
.

I
think
political
issues
will
take
secondary
importance
to
all
these
economic
issues
that
will
be

to

the

For

day

Friday

heavy
wet
snow
and
fog
on

Rules
call
for

to
be
completed
before
a
World	B	World Cup	Q982	MISC
Cup	I	World Cup	Q982	MISC

can
be

.

Organisers
hope
to
get
that
run
in
on
Saturday
morning
,
conditions
permitting
,
and
stage
the
race
later
in
the
day

on
Sunday

citing
too
much
new
snow
and
poor
visibility
.

If
organisers
are
forced
to
run
the
downhill
on
Sunday
,
the
super-giant

originally
scheduled
for

would
likely
be
