Next on the agenda for these firms is developing a new compensation structure , and 78 percent report that they are considering a new , skills-based plan for both management and non-management employees . This coming shift , O'Neal said , \" is not just isolated or a fad . It 's an inexorable change . \" After World War II , corporations adopted a \" military model \" creating hierarchical organisations where \" the concept of defined tasks worked great , \" she said ."}
{"document_id": "(392 Belgian)_0", "text": "But as the economy became global , customers were more demanding and problems became more complex . \" Multi-layers kept management at a distance from its customers , \" O'Neal said .

If it does n't do well , do n't expect a raise . Is this fair to an employee who can go the distance but is on a team that ca n't keep up ? \" That 's an important question we used to ask a lot , \" said O'Neal . \" It 's not a question we ask any more . The more important question is -- ' Do we have results ? ' \" To get those results , 27 percent of the companies surveyed plan to eliminate base pay increases in favour of cash bonuses and incentives , such as employee and team award programmes and education . Companies that can change their culture and view employees as business partners will do well , O'Neal said . For example , the survey rated some participants in the survey as \" high-performing \" companies , based on their return on equity above 16 percent . Those companies also said they already offer employees variable pay and business education , give their managers more control over pay decisions and celebrate employee and team success . \" They respect employees more , they trust employees more and they value their employees more , \" O'Neal said . \" The key to success at high-performance companies is engaging employees in a business partnership .

{"document_id": "(399 Gencor)_1", "text": "Gencor Ltd on Monday said it had swelled its year attributable profit and streamlined operations to strengthen it for the current financial year despite a variety of divisional setbacks . Announcing the group 's results for the year ended June 30 , chairman Brian Gilbertson said : \" Happily the strong improvement in financial performance is not an illusion arising from the recent weakness of the rand relative to the dollar . \" Gencor raised attributable earnings to 1,803 million rand from 1,003 million rand previously - in dollar terms an increase to $ 469 million from $ 279 million - and won despite the group 's Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd posting dismal results . \" Not everything has gone well . We 've had substantial production difficulties at a number of our operations . The most obvious one with the greatest effect on the corporation was at Impala where we had the furnace failure , \" Gilbertson said . Implats posted year attributable profit of 176 million rand from 281 million previously . Not only did the company lock in 3.92 rand per dollar in February / March , but it suffered output losses due to a furnace shutdown last August . The rand was last bid at 4.5350 against the dollar . Nor was Implats the only operation to fail output targets . Ingwe Coal Corporation Ltd was hit hard by heavy rains . It forfeited nearly one million tonnes of production to flooding at its mines in Mpumulanga province . But Gilbertson said the greatest gloom in the year came from the European Commission 's blocking of Implats ' proposed merger with Lonrho Plc 's platinum interests ."}

The group is soundly structured and prudently financed and is blessed with an excellent portfolio of world-class businesses . I think we can look forward to further growth \" . Citing the disposal of Gencor 's stake in industrial holdings group Malbak Ltd for one billion rand among other smaller disposals , Gilbertson said Gencor had pruned its portfolio to concentrate on core assets . \" We 've tried to clean up our overall portfolio by disposing of non-core assets . The biggest of those was Malbak . Overall a very substantial pruning ... leaving Gencor clearly structured along commodity lines , \" Gilbertson said . He added that the group still had about 85 million rand after tax invested in various shares , which were market for disposal when required . Referring to Gencor 's increased 41.5 percent stake in Ingwe , Gilbertson said the group would wait for coal shares to be cheaper before considering snapping up more . \" I think we would have liked to have more of Ingwe but it 's the question of adding value . When we bought the shares we bought ... at quite a bit lower than the price is now ... maybe if we just wait another few years for the next downturn in coal . \" Finally , Gilbertson said a growing proportion of Gencor 's income was coming from offshore and unlisted investments . -- Johannesburg newsroom +27 11 482-1003"}

{"document_id": "(633 SEC)_1", "text": "The Securities and Exchange Commission Wednesday approved rules designed to give stock market investors a better chance at getting the best price available for their orders . The so-called order handling rules , which were proposed last September , were approved in a 4-0 vote . The new rules will require specialists at stock exchanges and market makers on Nasdaq to allow customers to view price quotes from other electronic trading systems that may not be readily available to them ."}
{"document_id": "(633 SEC)_2", "text": "The rules will also require that customer limit orders be displayed with prices better than those available in quotes publicly available at the time . Specialists and market makers are companies or individuals recognised as qualified to maintain an orderly market in a stock . In a limit order , investors specify the price at which they are willing to buy or sell , as opposed to a market order executed at prevailing prices . \" These rules are intended to empower all investors , by allowing their orders to compete on a level playing field , and by providing the disclosure they need to make informed decisions , \" said SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt ."}
{"document_id": "(633 SEC)_3", "text": "The SEC 's goal , he added , was to create \" one system where one price could be available to everybody . \" The director of the SEC 's division of market regulation , Richard Lindsey , said Wall Street firms will probably need to spend about $ 7 million to carry out the improvements called for by the new rules ."}
{"document_id": "(633 SEC)_4", "text": "In proposing the rules last year , the SEC noted that while technology has improved , commonplace practices still existed that worked against investors ' best interests . It noted that customers whose orders were not displayed lost the chance of getting the best possible price available in the market . It also cited the potential problem of a two-tiered market in which market makers quote one price to public investors while quoting better prices in private systems , thus robbing investors without access to \" hidden \" quotes the benefit of the best available prices . Earlier this month , the SEC settled charges of alleged malpractices on Nasdaq when the parent of the Nasdaq market , the National Association of Securities Dealers , agreed to spend $ 100 million over five years to upgrade its oversight of brokers ' trading practices ."}
{"document_id": "(633 SEC)_5", "text": "The SEC dropped a third proposal that would have allowed investors with market orders to trade at a better price if there were shifts in prices before their orders were executed . The agency said it would monitor effects of the two new rules before considering the \" price improvement \" proposal again . The agency also proposed rule changes that would require continuous \" bid \" and \" ask \" quotations from exchange specialists and market makers who trade more than 1 percent of a stock during any quarter on Nasdaq ."}

Individuals with the disease have a non-working version of a gene responsible for producing a crucial muscle protein called dystrophin . In the study at the University 's Institute for Human Gene Therapy , researchers altered a common-cold virus to carry a version of the working dystrophin gene . The virus , which also was altered to minimise its susceptibility to the immune system , was then injected into the muscle cells of mice bred to lack dystrophin genes . In the experiment , between 30 to 40 percent of the muscle fibers in one group of mice produced dystrophin for two weeks before diminishing . Similar results had been obtained previously in test-tube cell cultures , but not in live animals , the university said . The university said methods are still needed to make enough of the altered virus to treat humans , to further decrease the immune-system response to the virus , and to deliver the virus to human muscle tissue .
