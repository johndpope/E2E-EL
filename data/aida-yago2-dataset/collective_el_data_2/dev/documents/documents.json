Department officials said July 's slight gain in incomes was the weakest for any month since January , when they were flat . Wages and salaries came under pressure in July as a shorter average workweek and lower hourly earnings cut into paychecks . The department said wages and salaries decreased by $ 6.9 billion in July after climbing $ 45 billion in June . \" In July , average weekly hours and average hourly earnings declined , more than offsetting the effect of an increase in employment , \" Commerce said ."}

It showed average hourly earnings fell in July by 0.2 percent to $ 11.00 and the average workweek shortened to 34.3 hours from 34.7 in June . Gains in personal income , which includes wages and salaries as well as income from sources such as dividends , interest and businesses , are essential for funding consumer purchases , which fuel two-thirds of national economic activity . Spending on all types of durable goods , which includes cars , fell to an annual rate of $ 626.3 billion in July from $ 633.6 billion in June . But spending on nondurable products increased moderately to a rate of $ 1.55 trillion from $ 1.54 trillion in June , while spending for services was up to $ 2.97 trillion in July from $ 2.96 trillion .
